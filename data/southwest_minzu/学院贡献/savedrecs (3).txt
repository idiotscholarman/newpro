AB Broadband sensibility and efficient image recognition are crucial for perception and memory storage in remote sensing, reconnaissance and environmental monitoring inspired by the human cognitive system. Although the amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film is compatible to the complementary-metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology, implementing in-sensor broadband recognition and memory based on intrinsic a-Si is still a challenge due to the band gap restrictions and the limited spectrum sensing ability. Herein, through doping of Ru (Ruthenium), optoelectronic devices based on the band engineered a-Si:Ru films have been fabricated with a silicon-oxide heterostructure, demonstrating comprehensive broadband image recognition, memory and convolutional processing simultaneously. Upon regulating the trapping and releasing of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, the devices could mimic various synaptic functions such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), transition from short-to long-term potentiation, lower switching energy and adjustable photocurrent analog states. Moreover, the in-sensor broadband convolutional processing has enhanced the high recognition accuracy for multi-band visuals, indicating a significant opportunity for future neuromorphic sensory applications and advanced robot visual systems.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B

ID BACTERIA; NANOSHEET; BIOFILMS
AB Photocatalytic antimicrobial therapy (PCAT) is considered to be a potential therapeutic treatment for bacterial-infection diseases. However, the antibacterial efficiency is unsatisfactory due to the limited application scope of photocatalysis. In this work, full-spectrum responsive tungsten disulfide quantum dots (WS2 QDs) are prepared for killing bacteria and enabling wound healing through photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. On the one hand, these ultrasmall WS2 QDs exhibit an excellent full spectrum (UV-Vis-NIR)-responsive photocatalytic effect by hindering the recombination of electron-hole pairs, thereby achieving the full use of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, the full-spectrum photocatalytic property of the as-prepared WS2 QDs can be effectively strengthened by redox reaction to deplete GSH for accelerated wound healing. In a word, the as-prepared nanoplatform exhibits the ability to act as an admirable antibacterial reagent with full-spectrum catalytic performance for photocatalytic wound healing therapy. Therefore, this work will not only provide an effective full-spectrum photocatalytic reagent for anti-bacteria therapy and wound healing, but also provide a rational idea for the development of other novel antibacterial agents for applications in the biomedical field.

AB Simple Summary Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important pathogen causing cattle respiratory disease; however, the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRSV in China remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRSV in beef cattle with BRDC in China, and the results showed that BRSV had a wide geographical distribution, and subgroup III strains were the dominant strains in China. The Chinese strains in this study showed a unique evolutionary trend based on phylogenetic analysis of the G and F genes and genomic sequences, which contributed to a better understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of BRSV. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important pathogen of the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC); however, its prevalence and molecular characteristics in China remain largely unknown. In this study, 788 nasal swabs from 51 beef cattle farms with BRDC outbreaks in 16 provinces and one municipality were collected from October 2020 to July 2022, and 18.65% (147/788) of samples from 23 farms across 11 provinces were detected as BRSV-positive by reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay. Further, 18 complete G gene sequences were classified into BRSV subgroup III, and 25 complete F gene sequences were obtained from 8 and 10 provinces. Compared to the known BRSV strains in GenBank, the G proteins and F proteins in this study shared several identical amino acid (aa) mutations. Moreover, five nearly complete genome sequences were obtained and clustered into a large branch with two America BRSV subgroup III strains (KU159366 and OM328114) rather than the sole Chinese strain (MT861050) but were located in an independent small branch. In conclusion, this study reveals that BRSV has a wide geographical distribution in China, and subgroup III strains, which have unique evolution characteristics, are the dominant strains. The results contribute to a better understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of BRSV.

AB Friendly and highly efficient acquisition of multiple active components from foods is always of great interest. For synchronous extraction and separation flavonoids together with oil from Tartary buckwheat, a new triphase dynamic system was developed with magnetic nanofluid based on deep eutectic solvent (N888-Cl/lauric acid, 1:2) (liquid phase 1), ionic liquid ([C4mim]Br) aqueous solution (liquid phase 2) and raw material powders (solid phase). It was the first time that two types of green solvents were simultaneously applied and assisted by magnetic separation. Through the investigation on key properties and operational conditions of this system, the extraction efficiency of oil and flavonoids in liquid phase 1 and 2 was achieved as 35.29 and 41.17 mg/g respectively, which were higher than that of conventional ways. Then kinetic and thermodynamics mechanisms were discovered comprehensively. After targeted recovery, the spectral characterization and antioxidant activity of two products proved the effectiveness of the developed method.

AB PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a validated drug target for cancer treatment that plays a critical role in controlling tumor growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, no FDA-approved PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor exists. Thus, a candidate with a better curative effect and lower toxicity is still urgently needed. Herein, we design, synthesize, and evaluate compounds belonging to a novel series of 2-methyl-1H-imidazo-[4,5-c]quinoline scaffold derivatives as PI3K/mTOR dual inhib-itors. Among them, compound 8o was identified as a novel candidate with excellent kinase selectivity. It manifested remarkable antiproliferative activities against SW620 and HeLa cells. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis results proved that 8o could regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and S6 proteins. Additionally, 8o presented a favorable pharmacokinetic property (oral bioavailability of 76.8%) and significant antitumor efficacy in vivo without obvious toxicity. Collectively, these results indicated that 8o is a promising agent for cancer treatment and merits further development.

AB With the advent of the smart economy, Chinese digital platform companies have begun the process of digital innovation. The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in early 2020 has added a strong impulse to the acceleration of this process, highlighting the unique characteristics of the platform economy in resource allocation. Although digital platforms have already entered people's daily lives, the profit mechanism of digital platforms remains a black box to be cracked for the industry. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a framework model for the profit mechanism of digital platforms, which to a certain extent solves the problems essential to the digital realm faced by many traditional enterprises in the Internet age-knowing that the profit theory of traditional monopolies is not suitable for the rapidly changing internet economy, but that most of the time people still must use it. In this new profit framework, we first use the symbiotic logic of value sharing to explain the underlying logic of platform profitability; secondly, from the perspective of resource complementarity, we find that the key to digital platform companies' profitability lies in the symbiotic synergy between platform companies and massive userbases; lastly, our study finds that the profit condition of platform enterprises is digital capability, not system possession. This article will analyze the bottom layer of the digital economy and, by identifying the various drawbacks of the traditional industrial economic monopoly theory, propose three key factors for the profitability of platform companies in the digital age: flexible strategy, digital capabilities, and symbiotic synergy capabilities. On this basis, a theoretical model of the profit of a digital platform is constructed. Research shows that the hybrid structure of digital platforms and the need for external diversification together lead to a platform's resilience strategy. The realization process of the platform's strategic flexibility and the process of consumers obtaining the residual value will lead to an explosion in network effects, causing the platform and users to complete value co-creation and realize value sharing. The implementation of a flexible platform strategy also promotes the further development of a differentiation strategy and a more-refined division of labor for manufacturers, lowers the barriers-to-entry in the industry, and enables the platform and the manufacturers to realize value co-creation. On the one hand, platform enterprises can obtain greater market performance; on the other hand, users' personalized needs can be more satisfied.

AB Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technology has attracted considerable attention in smart traffic monitoring, owing to the superiority of high-resolution imaging and tracking for moving targets in all-weather. However, in practical application cases, it is hard to obtain a globally-focused image of multiple vehicles by traditional ISAR imaging techniques due to the nonuniform motions of vehicles. Hence, a dynamic ISAR imaging method for multiple moving vehicles based on the joint of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) is proposed in this paper. First, the preprocessing for raw data is performed in the wavenumber domain to simplify the imaging task into linear phase error estimation and distributed image recovery. Based on the sparsity of moving vehicles, the OMP method is utilized to estimate the dynamic motion phase error of consecutive frames data for different moving vehicles with less computational overhead. Then, the dynamic ISAR imaging problems of multiple moving vehicles can be transformed into the distributed imaging problem with variously estimated phases. Motivated by this fact, the CADMM optimization framework is exploited for the distributed ISAR imaging problem to obtain a globally-focused result according to the consensus constraint characteristic of multiple vehicles. Lastly, both the simulation and real data experiments are conducted to verify the performance and feasibility of the OMP-CADMM method. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of dynamic imaging and de-noising for multiple vehicles without signal separation.

AB Helictotrichon virescens is a perennial herbaceous plant with a life expectancy of about 10 years. It has high cold and heat resistance and can successfully survive over winter in the habitats with a temperature range of -25 to 25 degrees C. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the key genes regulating low-temperature stress responses in H. virescens and analyze cold tolerant at molecular level. This study used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the hub genes associated with cold tolerance in H. virescens. RT-PCR was conducted, homologous genes were identified, and related bioinformatics were analyzed to verify the identified hub genes. Moreover, WGCNA analysis showed that only the brown module had the highest correlation with the active-oxygen scavenging enzymes [peroxide (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT)]. The expression levels of three hub genes in the brown module (Cluster-37118.47362, cluster-37118.47713, and cluster-37118.66740) were significantly higher under low-temperature stress than those under control conditions. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and KEGG annotations showed that the three hub genes were mainly enriched in the metabolism pathways of sphingolipids, selenocompounds, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate, carotenoids biosynthesis, and other biological pathways. The results of this study also showed that the subcellular localization prediction results showed that the cold tolerance hub genes were all localized to the plasma membrane. By constructing a protein interaction network, it was found that the hub gene Cluster-37118.66740 interacted with Sb09g003460.1 and Sb04g020180.1 proteins in Sorghum bicolor. By constructing phylogenetic trees of the four species of H. virescens, Sorghum bicolo, Oryza sativa Japonica, and Arabidopsis thaliana, the results showed that, the hub gene Cluster 37118.66740 (of H. virescens) and Os03g0340500 (of Oryza sativa Japonica) belonged to the same ancestral branch and were in the same subfamily. Thus, this study provides methodology and guidance to identify the cold tolerance genes for other herbage and their cold tolerant molecular mechanisms at molecular level.

AB This paper investigates a new (3+1)-dimensional fractional modified Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation (fmBBM). Two methods are applied to solve the fmBBM equation. On the one hand, we make a detailed analysis on the dynamical behavior of the traveling systems derived from the fmBBM equation. Accordingly, by computing a large number of complicated elliptic integrals, we obtain the exact expressions of all bounded and unbounded traveling wave solutions of the fmBBM equation. On the other hand, a deep neural network is established and trained for the first time to solve the high-dimensional equation. The exact solutions obtained by dynamical system method can just be used to compare with the corresponding numerical solutions given by the deep learning algorithm. The comparison results show that our deep learning algorithm has high accuracy and works well to solve the high-dimensional fractional equation.

AB This paper focuses on the synchronization issue of master-slave neural network with multiple time-varying delays by way of an enhanced stretchy event-triggered mechanism (ESETM). Firstly, multiple time-varying delays are considered to express the generalization and complexity of system behavior. Secondly, the ESETM is designed by employing an internal dynamic variable and a modified adaptive function, which can provide the expected robustness performance during synchronization on the premise of saving limited network resources. Thirdly, less conservative stabilization criteria are derived in terms of an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) candidate. In addition, Wirtinger-based integral inequality and reciprocally convex combination are utilized to estimate derivative of the constructed LKF. Meanwhile, a general activation function method is developed to introduce more information of system states on cross terms of neuron activation function to further reduce the conservatism. Finally, two numerical examples are illustrated to demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the development.

AB In this paper, the scaled consensus of resource-limited multi-agent systems with second-order integrator dynamics and undirected topologies is investigated. In order to reduce bandwidth and computation requirements, a scaled consensus protocol based on periodic edge-event driven control is proposed. It is proven that all the agents could converge to a scaled consensus state while the interaction topology is connected. Moreover, a self-triggered scheme is proposed so as to further reduce communication times between agents. Notably, the event-detecting period is introduced so that Zeno behavior could be excluded in our model. Finally, simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

Specifically, we firstly take simplified double integration as an example to deriving the multiple integral equality by using the integration properties. And then, we develop a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) including multiple integral terms, which improve stability criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and present to the superiority of potential efficiency in practice. More importantly, a stability criterion with less conservative has been established by using lemma and the principle of distributed integral calculation.

AB Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is one of the major pathogens in the bovine respiratory disease complex, which includes pneumonia, mastitis, and arthritis and causes a great economic loss in the cattle industry. In China, a live-attenuated vaccine strain M. bovis P150 was obtained by a continuous culture of the wild-type strain M. bovis HB0801 (P1) in vitro for 150 passages. Using the infected bovine macrophage cell line BoMac, this work attempted to investigate the mechanism of P150 attenuation and protective immune response. To begin, we show that M. bovis P150 effectively triggered cytotoxicity and apoptosis in BoMac, although with lower intracellular survival than P1. The transcriptomes of BoMac after infection with M. bovis strains P1 and P150 were sequenced, and bioinformatic analysis identified 233 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 185 upregulated and 48 downregulated. Further Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the majority of the DEGs were linked to CHOP complex, MAP kinase phosphatase activity and were involved in the IL-17 signaling pathway in immune response, MAPK signaling pathway in signal transduction, and p53 signaling pathway in cell growth and death. Among them, the level of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was significantly upregulated in P150-infected BoMac compared to P1-infected cells at different time points, along with its upstream and downstream genes phosphorylated-PERK, phosphorylated-EIF2 alpha, ATF4, and GADD45A increased in the PERK-dependent ER stress response. The role of CHOP in apoptosis was further verified by M. bovis-induced siCHOP knockdown in BoMac cells. The results showed that CHOP knockdown enhanced P150-induced apoptosis and dramatically increased the M. bovis P1 and P150 intracellular survival, particularly for P150. These data suggest that P150 infection upregulates CHOP expression, which can increase apoptosis and mediate a crosstalk between ER stress and apoptosis during infection, and hence, contribute to high cytotoxicity and low intracellular survival.

AB Global protected areas are the key factor in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, few studies use human activity pressure to assess the effectiveness of protected areas. This study constructed a human activity pressure index to assess the effectiveness of China's protected areas, and predicted the change trend in 2050 under the SSP scenarios. The results are as follows: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the pressure of human activities in 75.15% of China's protected areas is on the rise, accounting for 37.98% of the total area of the reserves. (2) China's protected areas can relieve the pressure of human activities by 1.37%, and there are regional differences in the effectiveness. (3) Under the SSP scenarios, the protected areas can alleviate the effect of the pressure of the population well. These results can provide a systematic and scientific reference for the planning, construction, evaluation and management of global protected areas.

AB An efficient metal-free, (NH4)(2)S2O8 mediated oxidative dearomatization of indoles for the construction of C2-quaternary indolinones was disclosed. A series of C2-quaternary indolinones derivatives with good functional group tolerance were obtained in moderate to excellent yields. This methodology provides an alternative approach for the direct generation of all-carbon quaternary centers at the C2 position of indoles. This catalytic approach represents a step-economic and convenient strategy for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles.

AB Insulin resistance is the major factor involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Although the oral drug metformin (MH) is widely used to reduce hyperglycemia, it is associated with adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for safe and natural foods that do not cause adverse effects as alternatives to commercial drugs. In this study, the active substances from Spirulina platensis, Grifola frondosa, Panax ginseng, and chromium-rich yeast were used to obtain Spirulina functional formulations (SFFs), and its therapeutic effects on mice with glycolipid metabolism disorder (GLD) were investigated. Results showed that SFFs not only improved glycolipid metabolism and reduced inflammation in mice with GLD but also showed good regenerative effects on the liver, jejunum, and cecum tissues. Moreover, SFFs could inhibit the growth of harmful microbes in the intestine and promote the proliferation of beneficial bacteria, thereby promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids and further regulating GLD. Additionally, SFFs significantly increased the expression of INS, INSR, IRS-1, PI3K, AKT-1, and GLUT-4 genes and significantly decreased that of GSK-3 beta in the INS/PI3K/GLUT-4 signaling pathway. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that SFFs can be further developed as a new class of therapeutic agents against GLD.

AB In nonruminants, microRNA (miRNA)-24 plays an important role in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and the liver. Although the abundance of miR-24 in ruminant mammary glands is the highest during peak lactation, its potential role in regulating the synthesis and secretion of fat into milk is unclear. This study aimed to identify the function of miR-24 in these processes using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in primary goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). A single clone containing a 66-nucleotide deletion between two sgRNAs mediating double-strand break (DSB) sites was obtained. The abundance of miR-24-3p and miR-24-5p encoded by the deleted sequence was decreased, whereas the target genes INSIG1 and FASN increased. In addition, miR-24 knockout reduced the gene abundance of genes associated with fatty acid and TAG synthesis and transcription regulator. Similarly, the content of cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) C18:1 decreased, whereas that of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) C18:2, C20:3, C20:4 and C20:5 increased. Subsequently, knocking down of INSIG1 but not FASN reversed the effect of miR-24 knockout, indicating that miR-24 modulated cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis mainly by targeting INSIG1. Overall, the present in vitro data demonstrated a critical role for miR-24 in regulating lipid and fatty acid synthesis and highlighted the possibility of manipulating milk components in dairy goats.

AB In application to time convolutive mixing model or frequency domain blind separation model for wireless receiving applications, frequency domain independent component analysis (FDICA) has been a very popular method but with adverse random permutation ambiguity influence. In order to solve this inherent problem in FDICA assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) based the Internet of Thing (IoT) systems, this paper proposes an new detection mechanism, named independent vector analysis (IVA), for realizing blind adaptive signal recovery in MIMO IoT green communication to reduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) and multiple access interference (MAI). IVA jointly implements separation work for different frequency bin data while the FDICA deals with it separately. In IVA, the dependencies of frequency bins can be exploited in mitigating the random permutation problem. In addition, multivariate prior distributions are employed to preserve the inter-frequency dependencies for individual sources, which can result in separation performance enhancement. Simulation results and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Background: This study investigated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission characteristics of lactating Holstein dairy cows in East China and provided a basis for formulating GHG emission reduction measures. GreenFeed system was used to measure the amount of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the cows through respiration. Data from a commercial cow farm were used to observe the effects of parity, body weight, milk yield, and milk component yield on CH4 and CO2 emissions.
   Results: Mean herd responses throughout the study were as follows: 111 cows completed all experimental processes, while 42 cows were rejected because they were sick or had not visited the GreenFeed system 20 times. On average, lactating days of cows was 138 +/- 19.04 d, metabolic weight was 136.5 +/- 9.5 kg, parity was 2.8 +/- 1.0, dry matter intake (DMI) was 23.1 +/- 2.6 kg/d, and milk yield was 38.1 +/- 6.9 kg/d. The GreenFeed system revealed that CH4 production (expressed in CO2 equivalent, CO2-eq) was found to be 8304 g/d, CH4(CO2-eq)/DMI was 359 g/kg, CH4(CO2-eq)/energy-corrected milk (ECM) was 229.5 g/kg, total CO2 production (CH4 production plus CO2 production) was 19,201 g/d, total CO2/DMI was 831 g/kg, and total CO2/ECM was 531 g/kg. The parity and metabolic weight of cows had no significant effect on total CO2 emissions (P> 0.05). Cows with high milk yield, milk fat yield, milk protein yield, and total milk solids yield produced more total CO2 (P < 0.05), but their total CO2 production per kg of ECM was low (P < 0.05). The total CO2/ECM of the medium and high milk yield groups was 17% and 27% lower than that of the low milk yield group, respectively.
   Conclusions: The parity and body condition had no effect on total CO2 emissions, while the total CO2/ECM was negatively correlated with milk yield, milk fat yield, milk protein yield, and total milk solids yield in lactating Holstein dairy cows. Measurement of total CO2 emissions of dairy cows in the Chinese production system will help establish regional or national GHG inventories and develop mitigation approaches to dairy production regimes.

AB With the prevalence of some high bandwidth-demanding applications, such as cloud computing, traditional wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical networks have difficulties in satisfying such growing bandwidth demands due to its limited allocation-flexibility and utilization-efficiency. Therefore, elastic optical networks (EONs). In order to realize the flexibility in EONs, sophisticated routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) algorithms areone of the keyenabling technologies. However, most of the previous RSA algorithms were proposed with invariant routing and spectrum allocation strategies, which ignored considering the time-varying characteristics of EONs due to the variable network architecture and service provisioning. And such timevarying characteristics can deteriorate the spectrum fragmentation and the service blocking performances of EONs, which stimulates the application of various machine-learning technologies in EONs. In this paper, a long short-term memory based routing and spectrum assignment (LSTM-RSA) algorithm is proposed for EONs. By employing the long short-term memory technique to sense the complex status of EONs (e.g. spectral usage on the selected paths), the proposed LSTM-RSA algorithm gradually learns successful strategies through accumulating operation experience in the process of interaction and obtains higher returns through enhanced operation, which helps improve the spectrum fragmentation and the service blocking performances in EONs. Simulation results show that the spectrum fragmentation rate and the blocking rate of the proposed LSTM-RSA algorithm are reduced by about 6% and 8.9%, respectively, when compared to the traditional shortest-path-routing first-fitting RSA algorithm.

AB Understanding the changes in population size, distribution and threats, is essential for assessing the status of threatened species. Northern China is believed to be an important stronghold for the Near Threatened Asiatic wild ass or khulan (Equus hemionus), but a recent assessment of the species has been lacking. To document change and updated the current status of khulan in China, we conducted a literature review targeting peer-reviewed and grey literature, newspaper articles, and summarized the results own field surveys and interviews from part of the species range. For a better understanding of the threats to khulan in China, we summarized the results of studies on environmental habitat factors and human disturbances for khulan, most of which are only available in Chinese language. Our results suggest that khulan in China have experienced a dramatic decline and fragmentation of their distribution range caused by excessive anthropogenic interferences. The remaining khulan range in China covers probably less than 40,000 km2 and is scattered over several nature reserves and the border areas in northern Xinjiang, northwestern Gansu, and western Inner Mongolia. We estimate the remaining population at about 4000 individuals, with ~80% found in Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang. The occurrences along the border with Mongolia are small and dependent on cross-border movements, which are currently severely hindered by border fences. Over the past 15 years, Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate National Nature Reserve was exposed to various human pressures and experienced dramatic population fluctuation in the khulan population size. Key factors which negatively influenced khulan were habitat loss, fragmentation, and disturbance due to mining exploration and infrastructure development. No systematic monitoring of khulan is done in the rest of the khulan range, but whereas illegal hunting seems no longer a serious threat, infrastructure development and land use changes (including increasing livestock numbers) are happening throughout the remaining range of khulan in China. Hence there is an urgent need to develop a national khulan conservation strategy and initiate cross-border cooperation with Mongolia to safeguard the long-term survival of the species in the Gobi region.

AB This paper investigates practical stability problem for nonlinear impulsive stochastic delayed systems driven by G-Brownian motion (IGSDSs). Practical stability can describe quantitative properties and qualitative behavior in contrast to traditional Lyapunov stability theory. Based on G-Lyapunov function, Razumikhin-type theorem, G-Ito formula, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy (B-D-G) inequalities I & II and stochastic analysis technique, some new criteria for moment and quasi sure global practical uniform exponential stability of IGSDSs are proposed.

DE Colorimetric detection; Copper ions detection; Anions enhanced;
   Ultra-rapid detection
AB It is of great meaning to develop a facile, reliable and sensitive method to detect copper ions in water. In the study, a facile method has been developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Cu2+. An interesting phenomenon has been observed that 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) ethanol solution can be extremely fast passed from colorless to yellow once Cu2+ ions are added. It easily occurs to us that Cu2+ can be quantitatively determined via the absorbance at 904 nm of the color changed TMB solution. More importantly, some specific anions (Cl-, Br-) can significantly enhance the absorption intensity. Under the optimized experimental conditions, this method exhibits a good linear response range for Cu2+ from 0.5 to 100 mu M, with the detection limit of 93 nM. Moreover, the possible detection principle has been explored. It is worth mentioning that the color change can be clearly observed by naked eyes for the detection of 1 mu M Cu2+, which is far below the threshold limit of Cu2+ in drinking water suggested by World Health Organization. It means that this method possess great promise for on-site Cu2+ detection.

AB The purpose of this work was to prepare multifunctional wet-spun fibers via an environment-friendly approach for drug delivery. Currently, drug-loaded fibers often face the following drawbacks, such as drug leakage and burst release. In this study, the fibers were fabricated based on carboxymethyl Bletilla striata polysaccharide-Polyvinyl alcohol composite spinning solution wrapping Polydopamine@Metformin microcapsule and treated with a simple Cu2+-ethanol coagulation bath, which were characterized and evaluated by surface morphology, physicochemical analysis, mechanical performance, swelling percentage, cell viability, release behavior, photothermal effect, washability, antioxidant and antibacterial properties. The fibers had appropriate mechanical properties own to the dual cross-linking formed by inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bond between carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups and coordination bond between the carboxyl groups and Cu2+. Most importantly, via the encapsulation of PDA@Metformin microcapsule, the fibers were achieved sustained and controlled drug release, and enhanced the antioxidant function. The composite fibers showed high biocompatibility toward the L929 cell line in vitro assay. Interestingly, with the assistance of Cu2+ and near-infrared radiation, the fibers showed effective inhibition against S. aureus and E. coli, avoiding bacterial drug resistance. Therefore, the intended applications of these multifunctional bioactive fibers are used for drug delivery and as wound dressings in medical textiles.

AB Low-cost wood materials exhibit excellent physical properties owing to their smart porous structure design. These materials have advantages over nonrenewable or hard-to-degrade plastics, polymers, and metals in some specific fields. Here, we report ultra-flexible wood composites prepared through coupling delignification and in situ polymerization. The polyacrylamide (PAM)-lignocellulosic and PAM-water bonds are broken and re-formed during the folding process. The PAM chains of the hydrogel unfold and slide, resulting in full dispersion of the stress in the wood composites. Hydrated calcium ions (Ca2+(H2O)(1-6)), derived from polyacrylamide-based hydrogel, can further allow the wood composites to lock in the liquid water. Therefore, the wood composites exhibit good flexibility at -40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Their ultra-flexibility can withstand evaluation in extreme environments, such as 1,000 folds with a 180 degrees bending angle or vacuum dehydration for 24 h. Good flexibility provides great application potential for the wood composite materials.

AB Nutrients in centralized discharge area of treated sewage can cause high ecological risks to aquatic systems, thus a deep-level nutrient removal is necessary. Recently, periphyton has attracted increasing interests for its excellent performance in nutrient removal. In this study, the suitability and durability of basalt fiber (BF) as a new green carrier of periphyton was evaluated, and development process of basalt fiber-periphtyon (BFP) was tracked with bacterial community succession and physiological indicators. Then, well-developed BFP was applied to deeply purify water containing the same concentration of nutrient as the treated sewage. Results showed the periphyton could adapt to BF and formed in large quantities. In addition, the tensile strength of BF after being used as a carrier was still strong. Bacterial community and physiological indicators indicated that BFP was well developed in 40-50 days. LEfSE and random forest analysis revealed that Deinococcus-Deinococci, Spartobacteria and Chlamydiia at class-level, Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales at order-level were the biomarkers for development of BFP. Moreover, application results showed BFP efficiently removed nitrogen and phosphorus from water and promoted the transformation of ammonia to nitrate. The concentration of ammonia and phosphorus severely decreased from 4.90 +/- 0.11 mg/L to 0.51 +/- 0.20 mg/L, from 0.66 +/- 0.016 mg/L to 0.023 +/- 0.013 mg/L, respectively. The efficient nutrient removal was attributed to accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism related organisms in BFP as well as favorable water physic-chemical conditions created by BFP. These results suggest that BF is a suitable and durable green carrier of periphyton, and BFP could efficiently reduce ecological risk to aquatic systems receiving treated sewage.

AB The rhizosheath is a critical interface supporting the exchange of resources between plants and their associated environment of soil. Favorable microenvironment of rhizosphere soil provides the rhizosheath formed and then promotes desert plant survival. However, it remains unclear how rhizosheath benefits the colonization of pioneer plants in alpine desert under changing environment. In this study, we investigated the effect of different soil moisture and sterilization treatments (three moisture levels and unsterilized or sterilized soil) on rhizosheath forming process of Kengyilia hirsuta (K. hirsuta), a sand-inhabiting and drought-resistant pioneer plant of the Tibetan Plateau desert. The results showed that in both unsterilized and sterilized soil, increasing soil moisture first increased and then decreased rhizosheath weight, with the highest value is 25%. During rhizosheath formation, developing rhizosheaths were selectively enriched in the bacterial genera Massilia and Arthrobacter. These suggest the existence of a highly specialized signal recognition system during rhizosheath formation that involves the accumulation of bacteria. These bacterial species exhibited different roles in the process of rhizosheath formation and is an advantageous strategy for K. hirsuta.

AB By exploiting the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the disclosure of public firms' top five suppliers, we examine the impact of a supply chain disruption on stock returns. Our findings suggest that firms with major suppliers in Wuhan experience significantly worse cumulative abnormal returns than those whose suppliers are not located in Wuhan. The results are robust to alternative estimation methods, event windows, and supply chain disruption metrics. Our findings suggest that supply chain disruption contributes to negative stock returns and highlight the importance of supply chain disruption on firm value.

AB Numerous molecular regulatory mechanisms are involved in the formation of mammalian oocytes, but many of their key proteins and molecules remain unknown. GPR50, the lone G protein-coupled receptor located in the X chromosome, is one of the superfamily members of the G protein-coupled receptor. GPR50 has been recently proved to play an important role in various physiological activities. However, the role of GPR50 in reproduction is currently unclear. In our previous research, we proved that the GPR50 receptor is present in yak oocytes. In the present study, the expression level and subcellular localization of GPR50 in the in vitro maturation process of yak oocytes were investigated to explore further its role in the maturation of yak oocytes. In the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, GPR50 was expressed and positioned in the cell membrane. By comparison, in the metaphase II (MII) stage, GPR50 had the highest expression level and was highly diffused in the cytoplasm. On the basis of these observations, the knockdown and overexpression of GPR50 yak oocyte models were constructed. Results showed that the expression level of GPR50 knockdown significantly reduced the excretion rate and maturity level of the yak oocyte PB1 (P < 0.01). However, the expression level of GPR50 overexpression exerted no significant influence on the excretion rate and maturity level of the yak oocytes (P > 0.05). This study verified that GPR50 plays an important role in the in vitro maturation process of yak oocytes. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is a downstream mediator of calcium signalling and participates in the regulation of various cellular physiological functions. In previous studies, the expression of Eriocheir sinensis CaMKII (EsCaMKII) was significantly decreased in the thoracic ganglion after Spiroplasma eriocheiris infection, as shown using TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis; however, the specific functions of EsCaMKII are still unclear. In this study, the full-length cDNA of EsCaMKII was 3314 bp long, consisting of a 1605 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 535 amino acids, including a 258 aa serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain (EsCaMKII-CD). EsCaMKII is highly transcribed in haemocytes, nerves (thoracic ganglion), gills, and muscles, but lowly transcribed in the hepatopancreas, heart, and intestines. The transcription levels of EsCaMKII were altered in E. sinensis haemocytes after S. eriocheiris infection. After the over-expression of EsCaMKII-CD in RAW264.7 cells, the apoptosis rate of RAW264.7 cells was significantly increased. After the over-expression of EsCaMKII-CD, the morphology of RAW264.7 cells became worse after being infected with S. eriocheiris. Meanwhile, the copy number of S. eriocheiris in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased. From 48 h to 96 h after EsCaMKII RNA interference, the transcription levels of EsCaMKII decreased significantly. The transcription of apoptosis genes and cell apoptosis were also inhibited in haemocytes after EsCaMKII RNAi. The knockdown of EsCaMKII by RNAi resulted in significant increases in the copy number of S. eriocheiris and in the mortality of crabs during S. eriocheiris infection. These results indicate that EsCaMKII could promote the apoptosis of E. sinensis and enhance its ability to resist S. eriocheiris infection.

AB Aromatized thioketal (ATK) linked the immunoregulatory molecule (budesonide, Bud) and the cytotoxic molecule (gemcitabine, Gem) to construct a ROS-activated Janus-prodrug, termed as BAG. Benefiting from the hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and other intermolecular interactions, BAG could self-assemble into nanoaggregates (BAG NA) with a well-defined spherical shape and uniform size distribution. Compared to the carrier-based drug delivery system, BAG NA have ultrahigh drug loading content and ROS concentration-dependent drug release. Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a typical disease in which chronic inflammation transforms into tumors. BAG NA can be internalized by colon cancer C26 cells and then triggered by excessive intracellular ROS to release nearly 100% of the drugs. Based on this, BAG NA showed a stronger pro-apoptotic effect than free Bud combined with free Gem. What is gratifying is that orally administered BAG NA can precisely accumulate in the diseased colon tissues of CAC mice induced by AOM/DSS and simultaneously release Bud and Gem. Bud can regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to restore and enhance the cytotoxicity of Gem. Therefore, BAG NA maximizes the synergistic therapeutic effect through co-delivery of Bud and Gem. This work provided a cutting-edge method for constructing self-delivery Janus-prodrug based on ATK and confirmed its potential application in inflammation-related carcinogenesis.

The C-N bond cleavage provides the direct method for amide conversion. However, amides, especially secondary amides, tend to be chemically inert due to the resonance of the amide bond. Here, we describe an efficient Pd-catalyzed transamidation and decarbonylation of multiamide structure molecules through C-N bond cleavage with excellent chemoselectivity. The transamidation of secondary amides and the decarbonylation of phthalimide provide meaningful tools for the modification of amino acid derivatives. Moreover, further transformations of azidation and C(sp(3))-H monoarylation emphasized the potential utility of this selective C-N bond cleavage method.

AB Fibroblast growth factor 1(FGF1) has been proved to bind to specific signal molecules and activate intracellular signal transduction, leading to proliferation or differentiation of cells. However, the role of FGF1 in goat adipocytes is still unclear. Here, we investigated its role in lipogenesis of goats, which depends on the activation of FGFRs. In goat intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes, we observed that adipocytes accumulation was inhibited by interfering of FGF1, the expression of C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, LPL, Pref-1, PPAR gamma, AP2, KLF4, KLF6, KLF10 and KLF17 were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.05). When the FGF1 was up-regulated, the opposite result was found, while the expression of C/EBP beta, LPL, PPAR gamma, SREBP1, AP2, KLF4, KLF7, KLF15, KLF16 and KLF17 were increased significantly (p < 0.05) in goat intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes. The expression level of FGFR1 was significantly and decreased with the interference of FGF1, and increased with the overexpression of FGF1. But in goat subcutaneous adipocytes, only the expression of FGFR2 was consistent with the expression of FGF1. Interference methods confirmed that FGFR1 or FGFR2 and FGF1 have the similarly promoting function in adipocytes differentiation. With the co-transfection technology, we confirmed that FGF1 promoted the differentiation of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes might via FGFR1 or FGFR2, respectively.

ID BINDING PROTEIN; FAT; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION
AB Intramuscular fat (i.m.) is an adipose tissue that is deposited between muscle bundles. An important type of post-transcriptional regulatory factor, miRNAs, has been observed as an important regulator that can regulate gene expression and cell differentiation through specific binding with target genes, which is the pivotal way determining intramuscular fat deposition. Thus, this study intends to use RT-PCR, cell culture, liposome transfection, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qPCR), dual luciferase reporter systems, and other biological methods clarifying the possible mechanisms on goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation that is regulated by miR-214-5p. Ultimately, our results showed that the expression level of miR-214-5p peaked at 48 h after the goat intramuscular preadipocytes were induced for adipogenesis. Furthermore, after inhibition of the expression of miR-214-5p, the accumulation of lipid droplets and adipocyte differentiation in goat intramuscular adipocytes were promoted by the way of up-regulation of the expression level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (p < 0.05) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) (p < 0.01) but inhibited the expression of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (p < 0.01). Subsequently, our study confirmed that Kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) was the target gene of miR-214-5p. Inhibition of the expression of KLF12 promoted adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation by upregulation of the expression of LPL and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP alpha) (p < 0.01). Overall, these results indicated that miR-214-5p and its target gene KLF12 were negative regulators in progression of goat preadipocyte differentiation. Our research results provided an experimental basis for finally revealing the mechanism of miR-214-5p in adipocytes.

AB A NiCl2(PPh3)(2)/XantPhos catalyzed synthesis of conjugated enynes by the cross-coupling of terminal alkynyl halides with alkenylaluminum reagents at room temperature in DME solvent was developed under mild reaction conditions. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in alkynylhalides give the corresponding cross-coupling products conjugated enynes in good to excellent isolated yields up to 97%. This process was simple and easily performed, which provides an efficient method for the synthesis of conjugated enynes derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a by-product of Chinese olive, an important economic tree, Chinese olive leaves have a large amount of hydroxytyrosol and other ingredients with high biological activity. At present, Chinese olive leaves can only be treated as waste and animal feed, causing a lot of waste of resources and pollution to the environment. Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers using hydroxytyrosol as a template molecule were synthesized by surface imprinting molecular technology. Several ways, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and vibrating sample magnetometer, were used to perform physicochemical characterization of Fe3O4@MIPs. The results of the kinetic and static adsorption experiments showed that adsorption equilibrium could be reached within 45 min, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 36.27 mg g(-1). Fe3O4@MIPs had good selectivity and specificity for hydroxytyrosol. Under the optimum conditions, an efficient method based upon MISPE combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for the determination of hydroxytyrosol in Chinese olive leaves with the high recovery rate (96.71-98.06%) and relative standard deviations of 2.35-3.27%. Therefore, this research provided a new method for the separation, purification and determination of hydroxytyrosol from Chinese olive leaves, improved the resource utilization of Chinese olive leaves, and protected the environment.

AB The Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, is an important economic aquatic product in China. Oxygen is essential for the crab, hypoxia is a natural phenomenon common in the process of aquaculture and will bring a harmful impact on the growth, development and disease outbreak of crab. To understand the effect of hypoxia on the crab, the pmteome changes of E. sinensis hemocytes in the hypoxia (1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/L of DO) and the normoxia groups (6.0 +/- 0.5 mg/L of DO) were obtained using iTraq labeling and affinity enrichment followed by high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. In total, 664 differentially expressed proteins were reliably quantified (567 upregulated and 97 down-regulated) using 1.2-fold change in expression as a physiologically significant benchmark. GO annotation, KEGG annotation, etc. were used to analysis these significantly different expression proteins. Many pathways or biological process were identified in the process of E. sinensis hemocytes response hypoxia, such as tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, cell apoptosis, VEGFR/MAPK pathway, prophenoloxidase system (proPO system), phagocytosis, and so on. Ten selected genes from these different expression proteins were verified by qRT-PCR analysis. Finally, the activity of several major antioxidant enzymes (phenoloxidase (PO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) were analysis, the results showed that hypoxia stress significantly increased these enzymes activity. These study could serve as a basis to understand the relationship between E. sinensis hemocytes and hypoxia stress, and also provide reference to study hypoxia stress in other crustaceans.

AB Taste is a crucial sense of livestock for their selective feeding. As feed additives, taste agents such as salty and sweet agents are often added to livestock supplementary feed to increase feed intake, and bitter agents are commonly used as repellents to protect vegetation from browsing animals. Selective feeding of grazing livestock affects community structure and ecosystem function in natural grasslands. Regulating livestock feed intake by applying taste agents to pasture is a novel grazing management tool. However, the effects of these taste agents on the soil microbial community following selective feeding have so far not been fully evaluated. In this study, three different taste agents, Denatonium benzoate (bitter agent), NaCl (salty agent), and Sodium cyclamate (sweet agent), were sprayed onto alpine meadow pasture on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Resulting evidence indicates that spray-application of taste agents to alpine pasture over three consecutive growing seasons, indirectly modifies soil bacterial diversity by stimulating appetite, and encouraging more selective feeding of pasture species. Compared with control, treatment with the salty agent increased both yak dry matter intake, and soil bulk density, but decreased plant diversity. Yet, increased forage uptake was accompanied by alterations to soil nutrient availability and bacterial community structure, including lower soil available nitrogen and bacterial a-diversity. Soil bulk density, NO3--N, soil moisture, aboveground biomass, and quantity of yak dung, were the main forces driving changes to soil bacterial diversity. Moreover, the structural equation model showed that applying taste agents to pasture affects soil bacterial diversity directly, and indirectly. This study further highlights that pastoral application of taste agents has impacts on the soil bacterial community, supporting the necessity to include bacterial components in evaluation of the consequences of using taste agents as a grazing management tool.

AB Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are important epigenetic regulators, play essential roles in the regulatory networks involved in plant growth, development, and environmental stress responses. Currently, as far as we know, no comprehensive and systematic study has been carried out on the PcG family in Medicago truncatula. In the present study, we identified 64 PcG genes with distinct gene structures from the M. truncatula genome. All of the PcG genes were distributed unevenly over eight chromosomes, of which 26 genes underwent gene duplication. The prediction of protein interaction network indicated that 34 M. truncatula PcG proteins exhibited protein-protein interactions, and MtMSI1;4 and MtVRN2 had the largest number of protein-protein interactions. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we divided 375 PcG proteins from 27 species into three groups and nine subgroups. Group I and Group III were composed of five components from the PRC1 complex, and Group II was composed of four components from the PRC2 complex. Additionally, we found that seven PcG proteins in M. truncatula were closely related to the corresponding proteins of Cicer arietinum. Syntenic analysis revealed that PcG proteins had evolved more conservatively in dicots than in monocots. M. truncatula had the most collinearity relationships with Glycine max (36 genes), while collinearity with three monocots was rare (eight genes). The analysis of various types of expression data suggested that PcG genes were involved in the regulation and response process of M. truncatula in multiple developmental stages, in different tissues, and for various environmental stimuli. Meanwhile, many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the RNA-seq data, which had potential research value in further studies on gene function verification. These findings provide novel and detailed information on the M. truncatula PcG family, and in the future it would be helpful to carry out related research on the PcG family in other legumes.

AB Caspases are classified as inflammatory or apoptotic category. Inflammatory caspases participate in inflammasome activation, while apoptotic caspases mediate apoptotic activation. Previous studies have shown that apoptotic caspases prevent the production of IFN-beta during apoptosis or virus infection. However, the relationship between apoptotic caspases and IFN-beta production during intracellular bacterial infection is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of apoptotic caspases in IFN-beta production induced by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection. M. bovis is an intracellular bacterium and belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. M. bovis infection can cause tuberculosis in animals and human beings. In the current study, we found that M. bovis infection triggered mitochondrial stress, which caused the leakage of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, and in turn, activated the downstream caspase-9 and-3. Furthermore, our results showed that activation of apoptotic caspases reduced IFN-beta production during M. bovis infection and vice versa. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that apoptotic caspases prevented IFN-beta production by decreasing p-IRF3 nuclear translocation. Our findings demonstrate that apoptotic caspases negatively regulate the production of IFN-beta-induced by an intracellular bacterial infection. (C) 2021 The British Infection Association.

AB Tumor drainage lymph node identification and dissection are crucial for the oncological surgery to prevent/delay the recurrence. However, commercial imaging reagents distinguish the lymph nodes by staining them dark, which would be seriously interfered by blood and surrounding tissues. In this study, we reported the Cr3+/Pr3+doped zinc gallogermanate persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) for fast tumor drainage lymph node imaging with high contrast. PLNPs were synthesized by citrate sol-gel method and dispersed in Tween 80 for in vivo applications. PLNPs were well dispersed in water with hydrodynamic radii of 5 nm and emitted strong persistent luminescence at 696 nm upon the irradiation of UV light. The advantage of afterglow imaging over fluorescent imaging of PLNPs was first established after subcutaneous injection to mice with much higher contrast and less interference of autofluorescence. PLNPs quickly migrated to sentinel lymph nodes after the interdermal injection to extremity of mice. The tumor drainage lymph node imaging was achieved within 5 min upon the intratumoral injection to H460 tumor bearing mice and the signal to noise ratio was 462. Due to the lack of targeting moieties, the intravenous injected PLNPs mainly accumulated in liver. There were no statistical changes in serum biochemistry and abnormal histopathological characteristic, indicating the low toxicity of PLNPs. These findings highlighted the great potential of PLNPs as high-performance imaging reagent for lymph node identification.

AB Corporate environmental responsibility (CER) plays an important role in the sustainable policy of firms and affects the behaviors of managers. For U.S. listed firms for 1993-2018, our paper establishes an empirical model to detect CER's effect on managerial learning, which is reflected in investment-price sensitivity. We find that after controlling for endogeneity, CER concerns enhance investment-price sensitivity, while CER strength does not affect investment-price sensitivity. Further, we find that the effect of CER concerns is more pronounced for firms with more market competition, greater bankruptcy risk, and more product market uncertainty. Taken together, our evidence suggests that CER concerns could enhance the extent of managerial learning, especially for firms experiencing greater risks. Our paper provides new evidence for the role of CER in reducing corporate risk. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) fluxes are two important soil-atmosphere carbon exchange processes that have been well documented at the local scale. However, the spatial patterns and controlling factors of these processes remain unclear in the Tibetan alpine permafrost region at the watershed scale. We conducted a two-year field monitoring study of Re and CH4 fluxes at three altitudinal positions on shady and sunny slopes in a Tibetan alpine grassland to determine the spatial variability in the two processes and to identify their underlying mechanisms. The microbial factor had a controlling effect on Re spatial variability in alpine grassland watersheds. The lower soil temperature and soil organic matter content at the upper slope positions on the shady slopes inhibited Re because they reduced the soil microbial activity. We found that the alpine grassland to be a net sink of atmospheric CH4, and the average CH4 flux rates exhibited large spatial variance ranging from 1.60 to 10.48 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) within the watersheds. The spatial variability in soil volumetric water content explained 76% of the variation in CH4 fluxes within the watersheds. We suggest that the influence of permafrost on hydrologic conditions may increase the spatial variability of soil moisture (measured as soil volumetric water content and water-filled pore space) in alpine grassland watersheds, and generally form poorly drained landscape at the lower slope position where Re and CH4 uptake are inhibited. Our results highlight the indirect effects of terrain and permafrost on Re and CH4 fluxes through their effects on biophysiochemical factors. We recommend that the spatial variability in Re and CH4 fluxes at the watershed scale of Tibetan alpine grassland should be given more attention in earth system models, especially the variability of CH4 fluxes with altitudinal position.

AB Improving the tumor targeting of docetaxel (DTX) would not only be favored for the chemotherapeutic efficacy, but also reduce its side effects. However, the regulation of the tumor microenvironment could further inhibit the growth of tumors. In this study, we introduced a system consisting of hypoxia-engineered bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (H-bMSCs) and DTX micelles (DTX-M) for breast cancer treatment. First, the stem cell chemotherapy complex system (DTX@H-bMSCs) with tumor-targeting ability was constructed according to the uptake of DTX-M by hypoxia-induced bMSCs (H-bMSCs). DTX micellization improved the uptake efficiency of DTX by H-bMSCs, which equipped DTX@H-bMSCs with satisfactory drug loading and stability. Furthermore, the migration of DTX@H-bMSCs revealed that it could effectively target the tumor site and facilitate the drug transport between cells. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics of DTX@H-bMSCs exhibited a superior antitumor effect, which could promote the apoptosis of 4T1 cells and upregulate the expression of inflammatory factors at the tumor site. In brief, DTX@H-bMSCs enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect in breast cancer treatment.

AB As a member of the MicroRNA s (miRNAs) family, miR-421 has been widely studied in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells a. However, there are still no reports on miR-421 in regulating adipocyte differentiation and its related mechanisms. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the potential involvement of miR-421 in goat intramuscular preadipocytes (P_IMA). The expression level of miR-421 was measured via quantitative real-time PCR during goat P_IMA differentiation. And the effects of miR-421 on goat P_IMA differentiation were studied by liposome transfection, Oil red O staining and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the miR-421 target was searched and the underlying mechanism was clarified by luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiment. Our results showed that inhibition of miR-421 could accumulation of lipid droplets by upregulation the expression level of AP2, LPL, C/EBP alpha and SREBP1. Further studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) was the direct target of miR-421. Knocking down of FGF13 expression could inhibit lipid droplet formation and down-regulated the expression of key adipogenic regulatory genes. In addition, the rescue experiment revealed that FGF13 is involved in miR-421-induced differentiation of goat P_IMA as a key factor. Overall, these findings indicate that miR-421 is a negative regulator in the progression of differentiation of goat P_IMA by inhibiting the expression of FGF13.

AB Decorating metal oxides with wide band-gap semiconductor nano-particles constitute an important approach for synthesizing nano-photocatalysts, where the photocatalytic activity is attributed to the band diagram related effective charge separation and external in-band quantum yield (EIQY). However, up to now, the correlation between the irradiation intensity and the functionalization of the in-band quantum yield has not yet been explained. In this work, by investigating the photocatalytic activity of ZnO and CuO/ZnO (CZO) nano-photocatalysts under various irradiative intensities, we show that the effective charge separation in the CuO/ZnO band alignment is sensitive to weak illumination, while ZnO exhibits a competitive photocatalytic activity with CZO under strong illumination. As a consequence, by modifying the irradiation intensity, the intrinsic ZnO can achieve a similar photocatalytic activity to that of metal oxide decorated ZnO. Besides, the optimal photocatalytic activity of CZO is found to be reachable by manipulating the pollutant concentration.

DE human milk; infant formula; lipid metabolism; neonatal piglets
AB We tested the hypothesis that the consumption of different milk lipids is one of the factors affecting metabolic response to lipid in the early life of infants. Neonatal piglets, as animal models, were stratified by the feeding mode (formula-fed, bovine-, caprine-, and human milk-fed). Lipidomic profiles of plasma and liver samples were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results indicate that 31, 54, and 28 differential lipid species could be used as potential biomarkers for bovine milk, caprine milk, and infant formula-fed samples, respectively, and the main lipid classes screened in plasma were SM, PC, and PE, including PC(14:1/P-20:0) as the isoform of PC(34:1), which regulates the lipid metabolism gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, PPAR-alpha. SM(d15:1/22:0) was the common potential biomarker screened from all of the groups. The amounts of biomarkers screened from the caprine milk-fed liver samples were the highest, which had a significant effect on the distribution of SM, PI, and PA. Infant formula, bovine-, and caprine milk-fed samples had an obvious effect on the metabolism of glycerophospholipid and glycerol ester, especially TG (16:0/18:0/18:2).

AB Fatigue was a frequently reported adverse event associated with the use of PARP inhibitors. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to fully investigate the fatigue of PARP inhibitors in cancer patients. Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) treated with PARP inhibitors till July 2020. Twenty-nine RCTs and 9479 patients were included. This meta-analysis suggests that the use of PARP inhibitors significantly increase the risk of developing all-grade (RR, 1.25; 95%CI, 1.20-1.31; p < 0.00001; I-2 = 48%) and high-grade fatigue (RR, 1.92; 95%CI, 1.51-2.45; p < 0.00001; I-2 = 11%). Veliparib was associated with a relatively lower risk of fatigue. Patients with ovarian cancer tend to be associated with a higher risk of fatigue than those with non-ovarian cancer. Longer duration of therapy was associated with a higher risk of all-grade fatigue. Patients receiving PARP inhibitor monotherapy tends to be associated with a higher risk of all-grade fatigue than those receiving combination treatment.

AB A sucralose-derived magnetically separable carbon-based solid acid catalyst with cellulose-binding and catalytic sites has been successfully prepared by incompletely carbonizing the sulfonated sucralose with Fe3+ at high temperature to load -Fe2O3 nanoparticles onto the surface of the catalyst. The resultant magnetic catalyst was fully characterized and found to be suitable in the hydrolysis of cellulose. Microcrystalline cellulose pretreated by ball milling achieved the highest glucose yield of 32% using this neoteric catalyst at 363 K. Catalysts retained 90% of their activity after five runs recycle. The introduction of magnetic properties into the catalyst system will combine the high catalytic capacity for hydrolyzing cellulose and magnetic materials' separation convenience.

AB Antibacterial and antioxidant fibers that prevent bacterial infection and oxidative damage have attracted great scientific interest in the textile industry and biomedical fields. The present study reports a novel composite fiber (TPU/ZrP/Rr) prepared by incorporating zirconium phosphate (ZrP) with antibacterial property and natural Rheum rhabarbarum (Rr) powder possessing antioxidant activity into thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix via wet-spinning technology. The prepared fibers were systematically characterized for their structure, morphologies, mechanical properties, surface wettability, antioxidant activity and antibacterial performance. The antioxidant activity of TPU/ZrP/Rr was evaluated according to the scavenging rates on three types of radicals of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), superoxide anion and hydroxyl, and determined as 95.4%, 18.6% and 20.7%, respectively; In addition, TPU/ZrP/Rr fibers exhibited high biocidal efficacy up to 99.99% according to the growth inhibition of Gram positive S. aureus and Gram negative E. coli through contact model. Collectively, the desirable antibacterial and antioxidant performance as well as other properties enable the TPU/ZrP/Rr fibers to be very promising for biomedical textiles and food packaging applications.

AB In pigs, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism and the correlation to reproductive performance across breeds and individuals have been largely reported, however, experimental proof has never been provided. In this study, we analyzed 807 sows for correlation of total number born (TNB) and mitotype, which presented the maximum of 1.73 piglets for mtDNA contribution. Cybrid models representing different mitotypes were generated for identification of the mtDNA effect. Results indicated significant differences on cellular and molecular characteristics among cybrids, including energy metabolic traits, mtDNA copy numbers and transcriptions, mRNA and protein expressions on mitochondrial biogenesis genes and reproduction-related genes. Referring to mitotypes, the cybrids with prolific mitotypes presented significantly higher oxygen consumption rate (OCR) productions, mtDNA transcriptions and copy numbers than those with common mitotypes, while both mRNA and protein expressions of PPARA, TFAM, ER1, ER2, and ESRRG in prolific cybrids were significantly higher than those with common mitotypes. Cybrid models reflected the mtDNA effect on pig litter size, suggesting the potential application of mtDNA polymorphism in pig selection and breeding practices.

AB The Yi nationality herbal formula Wosi is used in China as a folk medicine to treat arthritis and related diseases. Despite its widespread use, the active ingredients, and pharmacological mechanisms are not performed. This is the first time to identify the active compounds from Wosi with the aim at providing the potential effect of Wosi and exploring its underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism in monosodium urate crystals (MSU)-induced arthritis rats. In this study, anti-hyperuricemia effect was assessed by reducing the serum uric acid levels and increasing uric acid excretion in the urine for the hyperuricemia rat model. Wosi significantly suppressed the degree of joint swelling and improved the symptoms of inflammation induced by MSU crystals. The inhibition of IL-2, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, and IL-6 secretion and IL-10 increase in the serum were also observed. This study also focuses on the screening of the main compounds from Wosi against cyclooxygenase for anti-inflammatory properties using molecular docking. The result showed 3-O-[alpha-L-pyran rhamnose(1-3)-beta-D-pyran glucuronic acid]- oleanolic acid, 3-O-(beta-D-pyran glucuronic acid)-oleanolic acid-28-O-beta-D-pyran glucoside, and 3-O-[alpha-L-pyran rhamnose(1-3)-beta-D-pyran glucuronic acid]-oleanolic acid-28-O-beta-D-pyran glucoside with a higher binding affinity for COX-2 than COX-1 which indicated relatively higher interaction than COX-1. The preferential selectivity toward inhibiting COX-2 enzyme over COX-1 of three compounds from Wosi were evaluated using in-vitro cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1/2) inhibition assays. Meanwhile, the down-regulated protein expression of COX-2 and VCAM-1 in synovial tissue sections from ankle joints of experiments rats were confirmed by immunohistochemistry analysis after the Wosi treatment. In conclusion, three oleanolic acid glycosides were implied as mainly efficient compounds in Yi nationality herbal formula Wosi for arthritis therapy via selectively influencing COX-2 and VCAM-1 signaling.

AB Background Domestic yaks play an indispensable role in sustaining the livelihood of Tibetans and other ethnic groups on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), by providing milk and meat. They have evolved numerous physiological adaptations to high-altitude environment, including strong blood oxygen transportation capabilities and high metabolism. The roles of DNA methylation and gene expression in milk production and high-altitudes adaptation need further exploration. Results We performed genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of breast, lung, and biceps brachii muscle tissues from yaks of different ages. We identified 432,350 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the age groups within each tissue. The post-mature breast tissue had considerably more differentially methylated regions (155,957) than that from the three younger age groups. Hypomethylated genes with high expression levels might regulate milk production by influencing protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. According to weighted gene correlation network analysis, the "hub" gene ZGPAT was highly expressed in the post-mature breast tissue, indicating that it potentially regulates the transcription of 280 genes that influence protein synthesis, processing, and secretion. The tissue network analysis indicated that high expression of HIF1A regulates energy metabolism in the lung. Conclusions This study provides a basis for understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying milk production in yaks, and the results offer insight to breeding programs aimed at improving milk production.

AB Addressed in this paper is the stability issue of discrete-time delayed coupled systems consisting of a difference equation and an algebraic equation in coupled states. First, a necessary and sufficient condition of exponential stability is proposed for coupled systems with constant delays. Second, periodicity and stability are investigated for periodic coupled systems. Third, based on the Lyapunov inequality, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for exponential stability of general time-varying coupled systems. Finally, as an application of these results, stability of discrete-time singular systems is discussed. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Antenatal depression (ATDP) is one of the most common mental disorders that occur during the antenatal period. As a serious problem in households around the world, ATDP has adverse consequences for both mothers and offspring and heavily burdens their families and society. However, until recently, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying ATDP remained unclear, which impeded early detection and intervention for this disorder.
   Methods: To explore the intrinsic cerebral activity alternations in ATDP, we investigated fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) differences in 20 treatment-naive ATDP patients and 22 healthy pregnant women (HPW) using voxel-based whole-brain analysis by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The correlation between the regional functional abnormalities and clinical variables in ATDP patients was also examined.
   Results: Compared with HPW, ATDP patients showed increased fALFF in the left medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as decreased fALFF in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, the right insula, the cluster covering the right ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and the parahippocampus (PHP). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores of ATDP patients were negatively correlated with fALFF values in the right VTC and PHP.
   Limitations: The study is limited by a small sample size and the fact that only antenatal maternal women in the second and third trimesters were assessed.
   Conclusion: The aberrant regional functional activities of ATDP patients were mainly located within the prefrontal-limbic circuit related to multiple neural system abnormalities. This finding provides insight into the potential psychopathology of ATDP.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) content determined by the intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation has a huge influence on the sensory quality traits of meats. It was reported that the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene could promote adipocytes differentiation, but the underlying molecular and functional characterization of theADIPOQfor regulating goat IMF deposition remained unknown. Herein, the knockdown ofADIPOQwas mediated by siRNAs during goat intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation. Also, the qRT-PCR technique was performed to detect the mRNA levels of target genes in multiply experiment groups. These results showed that theADIPOQwas expressed more than similar to 400 folds in subcutaneous adipose tissue compared to that of heart tissue, and the mRNA level ofADIPOQreached a peak at Hour 60 during the differentiation process, while at Hour 36 didADIPOR1 andADIPOR2. Moreover, the knockdown ofADIPOQpromoted the intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation and accelerated the lipid accumulation in the mature adipocytes with down-regulating theADIPOR1 and preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1) mRNA levels and up-regulating the mRNA expression levels of the CAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and transcription factor peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), etc. Our study will provide a new opposite insight that the inhibition ofADIPOQexpression during intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation promotes goat IMF deposition.

TI Mechanisms of generation and exudation of Tibetan medicine Shilajit

LA English
DT Article
DE Shilajit; Formation process; Source; Geological environment; Rock
   identification
AB Background Shilajit is a commonly used Tibetan medicine, and its water extract is mainly used for various heat-related syndrome, especially that of stomach, liver and kidney. Shilajit is found to exudate from rocks of cliff at an altitude of 2000-4000 m as a water-soluble mixture of black paste and animal feces ofTrodocterusspp.or Ochotonaspp. Because it is difficult to reach the exudation points so as to explain the its formation process, the source of Shilajit still remains unclear and controversial, which severely impedes its safety and efficacy in clinical application. Methods In this work, a series of investigations as rock flakes identification, porosity determination, rock mineral analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) have been carried out to clarify the source of Shilajit, including the storage condition and exudation process of its organic matter, and to investigate the geological structure of the exudation points as well as physical and chemical characteristics of the mother rocks. Results The Shilajit exudation points were mainly distributed on the steep cliffs, where there were cavities and sections that could not be eroded by rainwater. The fundamental structure of the exudation points was determined by the rock's bedding planes, joints, fracture surfaces and faults, and developed into micro-topography later. The exudation points were distributed in the Triassic strata and scattered in the Early Mesozoic granitoids. The lithologic features were mainly slate, carbonaceous slate and sandy slate etc. The background rocks were characterized by intergranular pores, dissolved pore, joint and fracture development. Organic matter was widely distributed in these pores and fissures, which had condition for storage and exudation of organic matter. Conclusions Shilajit mainly distributed on sunny steep slopes and cliffs with a slope of 60 degrees or above at altitude of 2000-4000 m. The lithology character of the Shilajit exudation area were mainly various metamorphic rocks of sedimentary rocks that were rich in organic carbon. The organic matter in Shilajit was found to flow out naturally from rocks along pore, structural plane and even accumulate on the surface of rock as a result of storage environment change caused by rock tectonic action.

AB In recent decades, artificial selection has contributed greatly to meeting the demands for animal meat, eggs, and milk. However, it has also resulted in changes in behavior, metabolic and digestive function, and alterations in tissue development, including the brain and skeleton. Our study aimed to profile the behavioral traits and transcriptome pattern of chickens (broilers, layers, and dual-purpose breeds) in response to artificial selection. Broilers spent less time gathered as a group in a novel arena (P < 0.01), suggesting reduced fearfulness in these birds. Broilers also showed a greater willingness to approach a model predator during a vigilance test but had a greater behavioral response when first exposed to the vocalization of the predator. Genes found to be upregulated and downregulated in previous work on chickens divergently selected for fear responses also showed consistent differences in expression between breeds in our study and indicated a reduction in fearfulness in broilers. Gene ACTB_G1 (actin) was differentially expressed between breeds and is a candidate gene involved with skeletal muscle growth and disease susceptibility in broilers. Furthermore, breed-specific alterations in the chicken domestic phenotype leading to differences in growth and egg production were associated with behavioral changes, which are probably underpinned by alterations in gene expression, gene ontology terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The results highlight the change in behavior and gene expression of the broiler strain relative to the layer and a dual-purpose native breed.

AB Yaks (Bos grunniens) live primarily in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (altitude: 2000-5000 m). Their milk presents unusual characteristics, containing large amounts of solids including fat and protein, and it is, therefore, important to understand the genetic makeup of the yak. To identify potentially critical genes playing a role in yak mammary tissue from colostrum to mature milk phase of lactogenesis, the early lactation (colostrum) stage (ELS; day 1 after parturition) and mature lactation (milk) stage (MLS; day 15) were chosen for comparison. An ELS-specific cDNA library was established by suppression subtractive hybridization and 25 expressed sequence tags at ELS were identified by sequencing and alignment. To further confirm our results the expression levels of 21 genes during the lactation cycle were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results confirmed 9 significantly up-regulated genes at ELS vs. MLS in yak mammary tissue, in which the l-amino acid oxidase 1 (LAO1) and collagen, type I, alpha I (COL1A1) were the most significantly up-regulated. During the lactation cycle, the highest expression of some milk fat genes (i.e., XDH and FABP3) in yak mammary tissue appears earlier than that in dairy cow. Our data also indicate MYC potentially playing a central role through putative regulation of COL1A1, CD44, SPARC, FASN and GPAM.

AB IMB1603, a spiro-benzothiazone compound discovered by our lab, displayed potent anti-MTB activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we reported a series of new BTZs containing the hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol moiety based on the structure of IMB1603. Among them, BTZs 11 and 24 displayed potent anti-MTB (MIC < 0.035 mu M) and MDR-MTB (MIC, 0.053-0.102 mu M) activity, good solubility (1.82-1.85 mu g mL(-1)), and low cytotoxicity (CC50 > 200 mu M), suggesting BTZs 11 and 24 may serve as promising candidates for further study. The molecular docking study of 11 toward DprE was also investigated, and revealed that 11 mimicked the binding pattern of PBTZ169 in the active site of DprE1.

AB Urological cancer refers to cancer in organs of the urinary system and the male reproductive system. It mainly includes prostate cancer, bladder cancer, renal cancer, etc., seriously threatening patients' survival. Although there are many advances in the treatment of urological cancer, approved targeted therapies often result in tumor recurrence and therapy failure. An increasing amount of evidence indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) with tumor-initiating ability were the source of treatment failure in urological cancer. The development of CSCs-targeted strategy can provide a possibility for the complete elimination of urological cancer. This review is based on a search of PubMed, Google scholar and NIH database (http://ClinicalTrials.gov/) for English language articles containing the terms: "biomarkers", "cancer stem cells", "targeting/targeted therapy", "prostate cancer", bladder cancer" and "kidney cancer". We summarized the biomarkers and stem cell features of the prostate, bladder and renal CSCs, outlined the targeted strategies for urological CSCs from signaling pathways, cytokines, angiogenesis, surface markers, elimination therapy, differentiation therapy, immunotherapy, microRNA, nanomedicine, etc., and highlighted the prospects and future challenges in this research field.

AB In order to translate the ethnic classics, based on the research on the Internet of things, machine learning, and translation technology of ethnic classics, the log-linear model is combined with the national corpus scale and the grammatical structure characteristics, and the phrase statistical machine translation is used to establish a discontinuous phrase extraction model. Then, the translation technology is studied from the three aspects of model definition, training, and decoding. Finally, the algorithm is compared with the traditional phrase extraction algorithm to verify its effectiveness. The results show that the extraction number of discontinuous phrase extraction model is significantly higher than that of traditional phrase extraction model, and the model can extract more phrases, handle larger and more complex text, and score higher in translation fluency. From the evaluation indexes scores of Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (B.L.E.U.) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (N.I.S.T.), it can be found that the B.L.E.U. and N.I.S.T. values of the traditional phrase extraction algorithm are lower than those of the discontinuous phrase extraction model algorithm. The discontinuous phrase extraction algorithm can not only extract the regular continuous phrase, but also obtain the discontinuous text, and the translation effect is better. In conclusion, the combination of Internet of things and machine learning can be used in the translation of ethnic classics to achieve high-quality translation of discontinuous phrases, which is of guiding significance for the study of machine translation.

AB This paper concentrates on investigating an enhanced independent component analysis (ICA) method for blind separation of signals corrupted by noise in wireless communications. Because of the traditional classical ICA methods that always have an inadequate capacity of anti-noise or insufficient separable ability in noise circumstance without satisfying practical application requirements. For this reason, two mechanisms are conducted to establish the modified cost function and fulfill the optimization assignment in the process of constituting an enhanced ICA algorithm. This proposed algorithm can benefit tremendously from the derived minimum bit error rate (BER) criterion and the novel adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimization approach. In this work, firstly, the novel cost function is obtained according to minimum BER fused into maximum likelihood (ML) principle-based ICA cost function. Furthermore, by utilizing Adam processing, the task of blind separation of mixed signals is implemented via optimizing this modified cost function. Lastly, theoretical analysis and experiment results corroborate the better effectiveness and robustness of the proposed enhanced ICA algorithm compared with a series of popular representative ICA methods.

AB Plant litter dynamics are sensitive to grassland productivity and the spatial heterogeneity of plant community. In this study, we investigated the effects of litter leachates on plant community characteristics using three plant species that represent different successional stages of alpine grasslands located on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We tested four concentrations of leachates (0, 50, 100, and 200 g L-1) from Kobresia setchwanensis, Elymus nutans, and Ligularia virgaurea. The leachates from the three plant species generally responded similarly, but the responses to the varying concentrations were significantly different. Addition of litter leachates negatively impacted the aboveground biomass and species richness. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was positively correlated with the litter leachate addition. The effects of the litter leachate's addition on plant functional groups varied-grasses were inhibited, forbs and legumes were promoted, and sedges were not significantly affected. This study demonstrates that litter leachates are a critical determinant of species diversity, grassland productivity, and community structure in QTP alpine grasslands. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB This study investigated the variations of the nucleotide sequences and ovarian expression levels of genes related to follicular development and atresia in prolific Jintang black goats and nonprolific Tibetan goats. Eight genes, FSHB, LHB, FSHR, LHCGR, ESR2, B4GANT2, BCL2 and BAX, were examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the LHB and BAX genes were not different, but there was one base change in the FSHR genes between the two breeds. There was one base change in the FSHB gene, which resulted in one amino acid substitution; there were nine base changes in the LHCGR gene, which resulted in five amino acid substitutions; and there were six base changes in the B4GANT2 gene, which resulted in four amino acid substitutions. The expression levels of the FSHR, LHCGR, ESR2, B4GANT2, BCL2 and BAX genes in the ovaries were not different between the two breeds. The plasma concentrations of FSH were not different, but the plasma concentrations of LH, P-4 and E-2 were lower in prolific Jintang black goats than in nonprolific Tibetan goats (P < 0.05) at 40 hr after removal of the Controlled Internal Drug Release Devices. These results provide some foundations elucidating the endocrine and molecular mechanisms controlling ovulation rate in goats, but these need to be further verified.

AB The broad spectrum of environmental protection technologies and their health effects have increased concern about path dependency and the "lock-in" effect. This study focuses on China's coal-fired power plants and their air pollution control technologies, due to the challenge of technology deployment in this sector. Our analysis found that there is a dominant technology scheme of air pollution control in the sector. Alternative schemes with better Net Present Value (NPV) exist beyond the dominant scheme, meaning that long-term economic efficiency is lost by implementing the current mainstream scheme. Facing the complexity and uncertainty around air pollution and climate change, this study suggests that single-technology-dominated environmental protection can pose long-term economic efficiency risks. This paper further points out the implications of technology policy improvement: paying attention to the synergy effects of air pollution technologies, the cultivation of technology diversity, the links between pollution control technology and public health objectives, and cost-benefit analysis together with NPV comparison.

AB Tanning with silicic acid, a kind of silicon-containing materials, is considered as a more environmentally benign process; however, the obtained leather would become stiff and brittle during storage in spite of possessing acceptable shrinkage temperature (Ts). Herein, we incorporated organosilicon material attaching silicon atoms with T linkage structure (e.g. glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, GPTMS) in the leather making process to investigate hydrothermal stability and porous structure, in particular their variation along with different storage time, through Ts determination, DSC analysis, SEM observation and SEM-EDS test. The results confirmed that the introduction of GPTMS stabilized properties of the resultant leather during accelerated ageing process, which may be ascribed to that GPTMS could prevent silicon hydroxyl groups existing in collagen fiber matrix from further condensation. Besides, the tanning mechanism of chrome-free tanning agent based on silicon materials such as silicic acid and GPTMS was investigated preliminarily by means of FT-IR and XPS analysis, indicating hydrogen bonds between silicon hydroxyl groups and amino groups in collagen molecules, and the covalent bonding formed by epoxy group of GPTMS and carboxyl groups of collagen fibers are beneficial to improvement of the properties of silicon-based materials tanned leather. These findings provide an effective and promising strategy to control condensation of silicon hydroxyl groups, and are of great significance to the development of a chrome-free tanning technology based on silicon materials.

AB Chemerin is a cytokine secreted by adipose cells and plays an important regulatory role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. However, the function of Chemerin on intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is still unknown in goat. Here, we cloned the cDNA of goat Chemerin gene using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) technique and further clarified the expression pattern of Chemerin in various tissues of goat. The siRNA against Chemerin were synthesized to explore the potential role in intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation of goat. Our results showed that the full-length open reading frame (ORF) of Chemerin was 489 bp encoding 162 amino acids, mainly expressed in liver and Kidney. The interference of Chemerin significantly inhibited the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocyte and down-regulated significantly the expression levels of adipogenic marker genes LPL, AP2, SREBP1, PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, and C/EBP beta. These data suggest that Chemerin is a positive regulator of lipogenesis in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Interestingly, the temporal expression pattern of Chemerin was similar to CMKLR1 during preadipocytre differentiation. These results will facilitate the research on the action of Chemerin gene in goat intramuscular fat deposition.

AB Aluminum nanospheres are served as a promising solid propellant, but the dynamic responses of their impact-induced agglomerations are not fully understood. For this reason, ReaxFF-molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate in detail the microstructures and mechanical behaviors of large-scale colliding aluminum nanospheres with diameter 10 nm at three impact velocity scenarios over the range of 200-2000 m/s. In terms of the microstructural evolutions of all considered systems, two aluminum nanospheres were adhered to each other but their directional deformations varied with the impact velocity. According to the stress-strain curves analyses, aluminum nanospheres underwent an important mechanical process of elastic deformation transiting to plastic deformation along with the increase in the impact velocity. Interestingly, we found that the impact-dependent elastic-plastic deformation gave rise to the structural transition of fcc to hcp by using the common neighbor analysis method. It most favors the hcp phase embryo nucleation while the impact velocity was 1200 m/s, and the fraction of hcp atoms reaches up to 40% under such condition. Moreover, the atomic mechanism of local fcc-hcp transition was revealed in this study, providing a quantitatively understanding of the phase transition process for controllable dynamical mechanical characteristics of large-scale colliding aluminum nanospheres.

AB This study investigated the role of pattern regularity in approximate numerical processing. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the change in stimulus size has a distinct effect on the adaptation aftereffect for random and regular patterns. For regular patterns, adapting to large patterns and being tested with small patterns caused stronger aftereffects than the reverse treatment, in which the participants adapted to small patterns and were tested with large patterns. For random patterns, this effect was absent. Experiment 2 revealed a distinct connectedness effect on the numerosity processing of random and regular patterns. For random patterns, reference stimuli were perceived to contain fewer items when the dots were connected by lines than when they were not connected, and the number of items in the connected reference was further underestimated when the participants adapted to unconnected patterns with the same number of dots. For regular patterns, this effect was absent. Distinct mechanisms were thus suggested for the numerosity coding of random and regular patterns. For random patterns, the change in primary texture features would be abstracted from numerosity processing, while connectedness could affect this coding by affecting the processing of numerical unit individuation. For regular patterns, generic numerosity processing is inhibited, and numerical judgments appear to be inferred from the visual processing results of texture features such as dot size or the distance between adjacent dots.

   (KSP); Quality of Service (QoS); Path Discovery
AB Source routing is the routing scheme that arranges the whole path from source to target at the origin node that may suit the requirements from the upper layer applications' perspective. The centralized control in SDN (Software-Defined Networking) networks enables the awareness of the global topology at the controller. Therefore, augmented source routing schemes can be designed to achieve various purposes. This paper proposes a source routing scheme that conducts the top-K QoS-aware paths discovery in SDN. First, the novel non-invasive QoS over LLDP scheme is designed to collect QoS information based on LLDP in a piggyback fashion. Then, variations of the KSP (K Shortest Paths) algorithm are derived to find the unconstrained/constrained top-K ranked paths with regard to individual/overall path costs, reflecting the Quality of Service. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently collect the QoS information and find the top-K paths. Also, the performance of our scheme is applicable in QoS-sensitive application scenarios compared with previous works.

AB Here, a hybrid fast damping control strategy based on bang-bang modulation is proposed for doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) against inter-area oscillations. Since the changes in active power modulation of DFIG may result in its interactive effect with torsional oscillations, this study relies on the modulation of DFIG reactive power to rapidly attenuate the system's critical oscillation mode. In order to overcome the buffeting of the bang-bang modulation, the proposed control strategy is designed as a hybrid scheme consisting of three operating modes which are switched based on the amplitude of the detected critical oscillation mode. The required lead phase for the proposed control strategy is determined using frequency domain analysis using detailed dynamic model of the DFIG. A comprehensive test is carried out by conducting simulation studies on a modified two-area system including an aggregated wind farm. It has been shown that the proposed strategy damps inter-area oscillations much quicker than the conventional continuous damping controller. Simulation results also showed that the control scheme is robust to the operation point variation and identification errors for practical application.

AB In this paper, we consider the robust mean variance optimization problem where the probability distribution of assets' returns is multivariate normal and the uncertain mean and covariance are controlled by a constraint involving Renyi divergence. We present the closed-form solutions for the robust mean variance optimization problem and find that the choice of order parameter which is related to the Renyi divergence measure will not impact optimal portfolio strategy under the cases that the mean vector and the covariance matrix are uncertain, respectively. Moreover, we obtain the closed-form solution for the robust mean variance optimization problem under the case that the mean vector and the covariance matrix are both uncertain. We illustrate the efficiency of our results with an example.

Through optimizing the composition, a relatively good comprehensive performance (e.g., d(33) similar to 455 +/- 10 pC N-1, k(p) similar to 0.47 +/- 0.02, T-C similar to 266 degrees C, strain similar to 0.148%, and d(33)(*) similar to 493 pm V-1) is obtained in the ceramics with x = 0.040, which is attributed to the construction of a rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary. Moreover, a good temperature stability of remnant polarization (P-r) as well as strain value (P-r100 degrees C/P-rRT similar to 89.6%, P-r180 degrees C/P-rRT similar to 73.2%, S-100 degrees C/S-RT similar to 92.6%, S-180 degrees C/S-RT similar to 74.1%) is gained in KNNS-0.040BLNZ ceramics with a broad temperature range from room temperature to 180 degrees C. Hence, we believe that KNNS-xBLNZ ceramics opens a window for the practical application of lead-free ceramics.

AB Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is an inflammation-related protein mainly produced by immune cells, such as monocyte/macrophages and activated T lymphocytes. It is essential for the survival and proinflammatory activity of immune cells. However, the function of AIF-1 in chicken still has not been defined. In the present study, AIF-1-like (AIF1L) gene was identified in Luning chicken. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the chicken AIF-1 protein was 16290.8 Da. AIF1L contained a Ca2+ binding EF hand and could interact with actin filament. Its transcript was found in all tested tissues including spleen, brain, heart, kidney, liver, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, lung, and a relative low-level expression was detected in leg muscle. Furthermore, AIF1L expression in peripheral blood lymphocyte was depressed in a dose-dependent manner with cadmium exposure and peripheral blood lymphocyte viability decrease displayed a similar pattern with AIF1L expression. The results indicated that newly identified chicken AIF1L might be associated with lymphocyte viability.

AB The efficiency of in vitro embryo production remains low compared with that observed in vivo. Recent studies have independently shown that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) modulation prior to in vitro maturation (IVM) supplementation improves oocyte developmental competence. In this context, special cAMP modulators have been applied during IVM as promising alternatives to improve this biotechnology. Accordingly, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of treatment with cilostazol, a PDE3 inhibitor, during pre-IVM culture on oocyte meiotic maturation in yak. Immature yak cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were treated in vitro without (control) or with 5 mu M cilostazol for 0, 2, or 4 h prior to IVM. Results showed that the presence of cilostazol in pre-IVM medium significantly increased the percentages of oocytes at metaphase II stage compared with that in the control, groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, pre-IVM with cilostazol significantly enhanced intraoocyte cAMP and glutathione (GSH) levels at the pre-IVM or IVM phase relative to the no pre-IVM groups (P < 0.05). After in vitro fertilization (IVF) and parthenogenetic activation (PA), the developmental competences of oocytes and embryo quality were improved significantly after pre-IVM with cilostazol compared with the control groups (P < 0.05), given that the cleavage and blastocyst formation rates and the total number of blastocyst cells were increased. The presence of cilostazol also increased the levels of mRNA expression for adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) and protein kinase 1 (PKA1), as well as decreased the abundance of phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) in COCs and IVF blastocysts, compared with their control counterparts (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that the meiotic progression of immature yak oocytes could be reversibly affected by cAMP modulators. By contrast, treatment with cilostazol during pre-IVM positively affected the developmental competence of yak oocytes, probably by improving intraoocyte cAMP and GSH levels and regulating mRNA expression patterns. We concluded that appropriate treatment with cilostazol during pre-IVM would be beneficial for oocyte maturation in vitro.

AB This paper investigates the problem of robust H-infinity control for linear systems. First, the state-feedback closed-loop control algorithm is designed. Second, by employing the geometric progression theory, a modified augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with the geometric integral interval is established. Then, parameter uncertainties and the derivative of the delay are flexibly described by introducing the convex combination skill. This technique can eliminate the unnecessary enlargement of the LKF derivative estimation, which gives less conservatism. In addition, the designed controller can ensure that the linear systems are globally asymptotically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance in the presence of a disturbance input and parameter uncertainties. A liquid monopropellant rocket motor with a pressure feeding system is evaluated in a simulation example. It shows that this proposed state-feedback control approach achieves the expected results for linear systems in the sense of the prescribed H-infinity performance.

AB Graphene sponge (GS) is usually prepared by reducing graphene oxide for the adsorption of pollutants. Different reduction methods lead to different reduction degrees, but the relationship between reduction degree and adsorption performance is still unexplored. In this study, we prepared three GS samples of different reduction degrees and compared their adsorption properties for different dyes. Taking methylene blue (MB) as the model dye, the adsorption isotherms, kinetics and influencing factors were investigated. The adsorptions of different dyes on three GS samples were also compared. Our results indicated that the adsorption of MB on GS was inhibited at high reduction degree by reducing the electrostatic interaction between oxygen containing groups and MB molecules. The adsorption kinetics slowed down at lower reduction degree. The pH showed more significant influence for highly reduced GS, which should be assigned to the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups at high pH. Ionic strength had ignorable effect on the adsorption. Beyond that, the dye properties also regulated the adsorption. The implication to the design of better GS adsorbents based on reduction degree is discussed.

AB This study investigated the mechanisms of the numerosity coding of random and regular dot distribution patterns. Experiment 1 revealed that connectedness significantly affected the numerosity perception of randomly distributed dots, and two adjacent dots were considered to be one numeral unit when connected via lines. The connectedness effect was much weaker on the numerosity perception of regularly distributed dots in vertical or horizontal queues and was absent in the perception of dots in diagonal queues. Experiment 2 demonstrated that randomly distributed adaptors induced a stronger effect of adaptation compared with regular adaptors when random dots after adaptation were used to test participants' numerosity perception. Experiment 3 found that the change in stimulus orientation has no effect on adaptation for random patterns. However, for regular patterns, adapting stimuli with an orientation identical to the tests caused stronger aftereffects compared with those with a different orientation. In Experiment 4, when random adaptors were presented ih one eye of a participant, the adaptation aftereffect was shown to exist in both the exposed and un-exposed dyes (binocular transfer), whereas the aftereffect of regular adaptors remained only in the exposed eye (monocular transfer). We interpret that distinct mechanisms might control the numerosity processing of randomly and regularly distributed dots. Generic numerosity processing seems to be automatically inhibited based on the coding of regular patterns. The absence of numeral unit individuation, which is coded at a higher visual-processing level, might play an important role in this inhibition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe3O4/CNT hybrids have been successfully synthesized through simple one-step methods. The resulting composites were characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and vibration and sample magnetometry (VSM) approaches. It was found that those Fe3O4/CNT nanocomposites were superparamagnetic. TEM observation indicated that the produced Fe3O4 particles were decorated the external walls of CNTs. The increasing of the ultrasonic times result in the changes in the average particle sizes of the Fe3O4 particles. For the Fe3O4/CNT composites, larger particle sizes lead to the greater magnetic responses.

AB This paper is concerned with improved delay-dependent stability criteria for generalized neural networks (GNNs) with interval time-varying delay. A dual delay-partitioning approach is introduced to partition the delay intervals [0, tau(a)] and [tau(a), tau(b)] into different multi-segments separately. A newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with triple integral terms is constructed by dual-partitioning the delay in integral terms, in which the relationships between the augmented state vectors are fully taken into account. The Wirtinger-based integral inequality and Peng-Park's integral inequality are employed to effectively handle the cross-product terms occurred in derivative of the LKF. Therefore, less conservative results can be achieved in terms of e(s) and LMIs. Finally, two numerical examples are included to show that the deduced criteria are less conservative than existing ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heterogeneous catalysis of Fenton-like process provides new alternatives to overcome the drawbacks of traditional Fe2+-H2O2 system. Herein, the modification of Fe3O4 with SiO2/C in one-pot hydrothermal reaction to prepare Fe3O4/SiO2/C nanoparticles (FSCNP) for the Fenton-like catalysis in neutral environment is reported. FSCNP could catalyse the decomposition of H2O2 at various pH values to decolourise methylene blue (MB), in particular the neutral pH 7.5. Correspondingly, the chemical oxygen demanding of MB solution was significantly removed. FSCNP-H2O2 system was resistant to radical scavengers. Higher H2O2 concentration and temperature would accelerate the decolouration of MB in FSCNP-H2O2 system. The implications to the future applications of FSCNP in dye decolouration and water treatment are discussed.

AB An increasing number of reports indicate that in vitro fertilization (IVF) is highly associated with long-term side effects on embryonic and postnatal development, and can sometimes result in embryonic implant failure. While high -throughput gene expression analysis has been used to explore the mechanisms underlying IVF-induced side effects on embryonic development, little is known about the effects of IVF on conceptus endometrial interactions during the peri-implantation period. Using sheep as a model, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis between in vivo (IVO; in vivo fertilized followed by further development in the uterus) and in vitro produced (IVP; IVF with further culture in the incubator) conceptuses, and the caruncular and intercaruncular areas of the ovine endometrium. We identified several genes that were differentially expressed between the IVO and IVP groups on day 17, when adhesion between the trophoblast and the uterine luminal epithelium begins in sheep. By performing Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, we found that, in the conceptus, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated mainly with functions relating to cell binding and the cell cycle. In the endometrial caruncular area, DEGs were involved in cell adhesion/migration and apoptosis, and in the intercaruncular area, they were significantly enriched in pathways of signal transduction and transport. Thus, these DEGs are potential candidates for further exploring the mechanism underlying IVF/IVP-induced embryonic implant failure that occurs due to a loss of interaction between the conceptus and endometrium during the peri-implantation period.

AB Specificity protein 1 (encoded by SP1) is a novel transcription factor important for the regulation of lipid metabolism and the normal function of various hormones in model organisms. Its potential role, if any, on ruminant milk fat is unknown. Despite the lower expression of the lipolysis-related gene ATGL (by 44 and 37% respectively), both the adenoviral overexpression and the silencing of SP1 [via short interfering (si) RNA] markedly reduced cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) content (by 28 and 25%, respectively), at least in part by decreasing the expression of DGAT1 (-36% in adenovirus treatment) and DGAT2 (-81 and -87%, respectively) that are involved in TAG synthesis. Consistent with the markedly lower expression of genes related to lipid droplet formation and secretion (TIP47 by 19 and 32%, and ADFP by 25 and 25%, respectively), cellular lipid droplet content was also decreased sharply, by 9 and 8.5%, respectively, after adenoviral overexpression of SP1 or its silencing via siRNA. Overall, the results underscored a potentially important role of SP1 in maintaining milk-fat droplet synthesis in goat mammary epithelial cells.

AB The resonant interaction between he energetic particle triggered fishbone mode and the shear Alfven waves is computationally investigated and firmly demonstrated based on a tokunak plasma equilibrium, using the self-consistent MIID-kinetic hybrid code MARS-K (Liu et al 2008 Phys, Plasmas 15 112503), This type of continuum resonance, occurring critically due to the mode's toroidal rotation in the plasma frame, significantly modifies the eigenmode structure of the fishbone instability, by introducing two large peaks of the perturbed parallel current density near but offside the q = 1 rational surface (q is the safety factor). The self consistently computed radial plasma displacement substantially differs from that being assumed in the conventional fishbone theory,

AB Cobalt/copper-codoped ZnO nanoparticles, synthesized with different Co concentrations by a sol-gel method using ethanol as solvent, were studied via XPS. Hexagonal wurtzite structure was found in all samples, with no evidence of any secondary phase. The average crystallite size of the samples was around 20-30 nm, altered significantly with increasing Co concentration. Copper ions and Cobalt ions are indeed substituted into the ZnO lattice at the Zn2+ site, as shown by XRD and XPS. Further studies showed dramatic changes of Cu valence from +2 to +1 as the Co concentration level exceeds 1%, accompanied by a blue-shift of the optical bandgap from 3.01 to 3.13 eV. Ferromagnetism of the Co-doped Zn0.95Cu0.05O thin films was observed and found to be tunable - a phenomenon associated with the valence state of the Cu ions and the existence of some defects like oxygen vacancies in the films.

The structures of the new compounds were characterized by IR spectroscopy, MS, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Assay of the newly prepared compounds for bioactivity against tumor cells revealed that the most of the compounds had good to excellent inhibitory activity against CDC25B (99.70 % inhibition).

AB Recently, increasing experimental evidence has indicated that G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) can form dimers, which are very possibly further potential functional units and new targets for drug development besides their monomeric units. However, knowledge about their structure and functional motion has been limited so far. Thus, we used an Elastic Network Model (ENM) and Protein Structure Network (PSN) to study three A GPCR homodimers (viz., CXCR4, kappa-OR, beta 1AR) with two different interfaces based on their basic topologic structures. The low-frequency modes from ENM exhibit similarity to some extent, indicating similar functional motions shared by A GPCR dimers, such as asymmetric motion in the ECL2 and TM6 regions around the interface, which should contribute to the negative cooperation for ligand binding and asymmetric activation reported experimentally. The PSN results reveal that the dimerization can reduce the main informational flows from the extracellular to the intracellular domain and affect the contribution of TM regions to the allosteric paths. Some highly conserved residues were still observed to be hot residues in the meta-pathway, further confirming their conserved importance shared by A GPCR dimers; in particular for F6.44 and F6.48 residues and one non-conserved position X7.39. On the whole, dimerization plays a different role in influencing the dynamic motion of the protomer, dependent on the type of interface and contact area. Compared to the TM5-TM6 interface, TM1-TM2-H8 exhibits more a significant functional-role in influencing the dynamic behavior and allosteric paths.

AB The sp(2) carbon nanomaterials have fantastic properties and hold great potential in diverse areas, including electronics, energy, environment, biomedicine, and so on. The wide applications of sp(2) carbon nanomaterials require the thorough investigations on their biosafety. The quantification of sp(2) carbon nanomaterials is the first and crucial step in the biosafety evaluations. In this review, we summarized the quantification technologies for sp(2) carbon nanomaterials and compared the advantages/ disadvantages of these technologies. The pharmacokinetics, the biodistribution, and the ecological uptake of sp(2) carbon nanomaterials were achieved by using the quantification technologies. Furthermore, the influence factors such as surface modification, size, shape, and exposure pathway were concerned, and the general rules in the biological behaviors of sp(2) carbon nanomaterials were proposed. The implications to the biomedical applications and biosafety evaluations of sp(2) carbon nanomaterials are discussed.

AB Pain-related stimuli can capture attention in an automatic (bottom up) or intentional (top down) fashion. Previous studies have examined attentional capture by pain-related information using spatial attention paradigms that involve mainly a bottom up mechanism. In the current study, we investigated the pain information-induced attentional blink (AB) using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, and compared the effects of task-irrelevant and task-relevant pain distractors. Relationships between accuracy of target identification and individual traits (i.e., empathy and catastrophizing thinking about pain) were also examined. The results demonstrated that task-relevant painful faces had a significant pain information-induced AB effect, whereas taskirrelevant faces showed a near-significant trend of this effect, supporting the notion that pain-related stimuli can influence the temporal dynamics of attention. Furthermore, we found a significant negative correlation between response accuracy and pain catastrophizing score in task-relevant trials. These findings suggest that active scanning of environmental information related to pain produces greater deficits in cognition than does unintentional attention toward pain, which may represent the different ways in which healthy individuals and patients with chronic pain process pain-relevant information. These results may provide insight into the understanding of maladaptive attentional processing in patients with chronic pain.

AB The objective of the present study was to formulate a multi-pathogen enrichment broth which could support the simultaneous growth of five common foodborne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7). The formulated broth SSSLE was composed of potassium tellurite, bile salt, lithium chloride, and sodium chloride as growth-inhibitors; glucose, esculin, mannitol and sodium pyruvate as growth-promoters. Compared with the respective specific selective enrichment broths, the individual growth pattern of each target pathogen in SSSLE was equal, or even better, except in the case of S. flexneri. In mixed-culture experiments, the gram-negative bacteria showed higher growth capabilities than the gram-positive bacteria after 8-h enrichment; however, the cell numbers after 24-h enrichment indicated that SSSLE could support the concurrent growth of five target pathogens irrespective of whether pathogens were inoculated initially at equal or unequal levels. For natural food samples under the high background flora, the final cell numbers enriched in SSSLE for five targets were enough to be detected by multiplex PCR. In conclusion, SSSLE was capable of supporting the growth of five target pathogens concurrently. The new broth formulated in this study has the potential of saving time, efforts and costs in multi-pathogen enrichment procedures.

AB Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) compounds with intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character have attracted considerable interest from experimental and theoretical researchers due to their potential in optoelectronic and sensory applications. However, their deactivation mechanism in solutions has been disputed, limiting their further applications. Therefore, in this work, we combined experimental observations with density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods to unveil the deactivation mechanism of a new AIE-active naphthalimide derivative (FNIb) in the polar solution, which was synthesized by us lately. An in-depth investigation on the effects of solvent polarity on its geometrical and electronic structures, and absorption and emission spectra indicates that FNIb would prefer a conformational planarization mechanism to the popular twisted intramolecular charge transfer mechanism (TICT) in the deactivation process. Our findings would add more insights into previous studies to rationalize the controversy on the deactivation mechanism of the AIE ICT-featured compounds in solutions.

TI Stable and highly selective Co-CeF3@Ni3N
   sheet-on-sheet heterostructures for PET electro-upgrading and hydrogen

SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The electro-upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) alkaline hydrolysate provides an energy-saving strategy towards green hydrogen and value-added anodic products, but the selectivity and stability at industrial-scale current densities (>200 mA cm(-2)) remain challenging. Herein, hierarchical Co-CeF3@Ni3N sheet-on-sheet nanostructures supported on nickel foam (Co-CeF3@Ni3N/NF) were fabricated for PET hydrolysate electro-upgrading coupled with H-2 generation. The hierarchical nanostructures can enlarge the accessible active area, while the introduction of Co species can modulate the electronic configuration, which can reduce the active species formation potential and optimize the adsorption behaviors of key reactants and reactive intermediates. Therefore, Co-CeF3@Ni3N/NF exhibits industrial-scale response current densities (80 to 380 mA cm(-2)) at applied potentials of around 1.32-1.44 V vs. RHE, as well as high stability (over 60 h) and high faradaic efficiencies (>97%) in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), which are superior to most high-end electrocatalysts. In situ characterizations and electrochemical measurements indicate the key active species and crucial intermediates in the EGOR, suggesting a reaction pathway towards high formate selectivity. Moreover, a continuous flow cell with Co-CeF3@Ni3N/NF as the bifunctional electrode for electro-upgrading PET hydrolysate delivers high activity (over 300 mA cm(-2) at 1.72 V), long-term stability (144 h) and high FEs (>95%). This study develops a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the EGOR and HER, while elucidating the active species, key intermediates, and possible reaction pathway for the closed-loop electro-upgrading of PET waste.

AB This study has been designed to investigate the volatile profiles, physicochemical properties, bacterial succession, together with their interrelationships along the 45-day fermentation of goose sour meat, sampled at 0 (G0), 15 (G15), 30 (G30), and 45 (G45) days. Fermentation resulted in decreased pH and springiness and increased hardness, chewiness, and L* values (p < 0.05). GC-IMS analysis identified 40 volatile compounds, with rPCA highlighting shifts in compound levels over time. Key volatiles, such as isovaleraldehyde-D/M, ethyl acetate-D, and acetic acid-D, increased notably at later stages (G30 and G45), while 1-hexanol-D/M and 2-nonanone decreased. Bacterial diversity indices declined, with Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus identified as dominant bacteria genera. Lactobacillus gradually outcompeted other bacteria genera, reaching peak abundance at 45 days. Lactobacillus abundance correlated positively with pH reduction, key volatiles, and chewiness, enhancing product characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights into bacterial and flavor development in goose sour meat fermentation, aiding future research.

AB Introduction Tibetan pigs, native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, have adapted over millennia to extreme conditions such as low oxygen, harsh cold, and high UV radiation, impacting their muscle characteristics and digestive tract microbiota. The quality of pork from Tibetan pigs (TP) and black pigs (BP) is influenced by various factors, including genetics, diet, and environmental adaptation. However, the specific influence of digestive tract microbiota metabolites on muscle traits remains poorly understood. Our goal was to correlate omic variations with meat quality traits and identify potential biomarkers predictive of superior meat quality, elucidate the regulatory effects of digestive tract microbial metabolites on Tibetan pig muscle characteristics, and reveal the genetic and nutritional mechanisms that promote adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.Methods This analysis encompassed metabolomic profiling of the entire digestive tract-including the stomach, jejunum, cecum, colon, and rectum-as well as histological, amino acid, fatty acid composition, and transcriptomic assessments of the longissimus dorsi muscle tissues to investigate how digestive tract microbial metabolites influence muscle adaptation to high altitudes.Results Analyses revealed that Tibetan pig muscles contain smaller, more oxidative fibers enriched with flavor-enhancing amino acids. This was accompanied by a more favorable n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio. Distinct patterns of microbial metabolites were observed in the digestive tract, influencing protein digestion and purine metabolism, and correlating with muscle glycine levels. Transcriptomic data showed varied gene expression in metabolic pathways related to salivary and pancreatic secretion, as well as carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Integrated multi-omics approaches linked stomach metabolism, particularly through bile secretion pathways influenced by acetylcholine, to muscle functionality, highlighting the important role played by the ATP1B4 gene in enabling muscle physiology in Tibetan pigs.Discussion This study highlights the importance of targeted dietary interventions in improving meat quality for specific pig breeds. It also provides a theoretical foundation for precision agriculture strategies aimed at enhancing the meat quality of both TP and BP pigs.

AB Nanomaterials based on metals and their alloys have been paid increasing attention due to their adjustable morphology, high stability and excellent catalytic activity. In this work, a representative type of low-cost, high-efficiency, pollution-free, and stable BiSb alloy nanomaterials was prepared using a low-temperature molten-salt electrodeposition method for nonenzymatic electrochemical sensing of folic acid. The morphological and structural studies of the BiSb alloy were performed using scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results revealed that the BiSb alloy nanomaterials with uniform flower-like ultrathin nanosheet structure. The BiSb alloy nano-materials with unique morphology greatly increased the surface area and conductivity of the material, which is beneficial to the electrocatalytic oxidation of folic acid. As a modified electrode, the prepared BiSb/GCE presented favorable electrocatalytic activity toward folic acid with a wide linear range (0.005 similar to 50 mu M) and low detection limit (2.3 nM). The proposed sensor has been successfully applied to the determination of folic acid in real human serum samples, indicating that BiSb/GCE is a promising candidate for nonenzymatic folic acid sensing.

AB BackgroundIntracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating neurological disorder with high morbidity and mortality rates, largely owing to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies. Growing evidence has underscored the pivotal role of ferroptosis in intracerebral haemorrhage, and its contribution to neuronal death and exacerbation of brain injury, thus establishing it as a crucial target for therapeutic intervention. In recent years, polyoxometalate nanoclusters (NCs) have been applied in various neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating neuroprotective effects. However, their impact on brain iron content and neurological function following ICH has yet to be reported. Here, we explored the potential of tungsten-based polyoxometalate (W-POM) NCs as ferroptosis inhibitors targeting the iron metabolic pathway mediated by S100A8/A9 for the treatment of ICH.ResultsWe successfully synthesized ultra-small reduced W-POM NCs that can rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier and are cleared through the kidney. In vitro experiments demonstrated that W-POM NCs exhibit significant and stable ROS scavenging activity while effectively alleviating iron overload and associated neuronal damage. In vivo, W-POM NCs treatment restored iron metabolism homeostasis, suppressed neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, ultimately alleviating severe neurological damage and motor deficits in ICH mice. Proteomic combined with bioinformatic analyses identified two core genes, S100A8 and S100A9, most associated with W-POM NCs intervention in ICH. Further experiments confirmed that W-POM NCs act by modulating the toll-like receptor 4/hepcidin/ferroportin signaling pathway, thereby regulating iron metabolism and reducing secondary brain injury.ConclusionsThis study pioneers the application of polyoxometalates in intracerebral haemorrhage, offering a novel and promising therapeutic approach for the management of ferroptosis-related brain injuries.

AB Nanocellulose has been widely used in various fields due to its good biocompatibility, mechanical properties, large specific surface area and environmental friendliness. Among these applications, uniformly dispersing nanocellulose in various media to improve its performance is an application with good development prospects. However, due to the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, nanocellulose tends to form aggregates between molecular chains and is less compatible with nonpolar solvents, thus making it difficult to be stably dispersed in solvents. How to break the aggregation between cellulose and improve its compatibility with the medium has become a challenging issue. In this paper, the dispersion system is classified into polar medium, nonpolar medium and polymer matrix according to the polarity and state of the medium, and a review is presented on how to improve the dispersion stability of nanocellulose in different media. The methods of using surface modification to improve the dispersion stability of nanocellulose in different media, such as carboxylation, amidation, and grafting of long-chain molecules to reduce the aggregation among nanocellulose and to improve the compatibility with solvents, are highlighted. Finally, suggestions are made for future research directions.

AB Monoclonal antibody therapy has been a cornerstone of human healthcare for nearly four decades, effectively treating a wide range of diseases including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. However, its application in veterinary medicine is a relatively recent development, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing chronic diseases in small animals. Dogs and cats, like humans, suffer from chronic conditions such as cancer, arthritis, allergies, and chronic pain, which mAb therapy could potentially address. This review aims to explore the therapeutic potential of mAb therapy in small animal medicine, focusing on currently authorized products, including their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety concerns. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the use of mAbs in veterinary medicine, specifically in the treatment of chronic disorders. While mAb therapy has shown significant benefits in human healthcare, challenges remain in its application to veterinary practice, including safety concerns and the limited availability of approved products. Despite these challenges, mAb therapy holds great promise for improving the management of chronic diseases in animals, with future research and development potentially expanding its clinical use.

AB Cellulose is the most abundant biomass material in the world. Magnetic nanoparticles can be used as reinforcing materials to give cellulose more functions due to their unique magnetism. According to the dispersion stability of nanocellulose, magnetic nanocellulose is divided into homogeneous preparation and heterogeneous preparation. In addition, the directional arrangement of nanocellulose by external magnetic field is also a way of cellulose functionalization. The current preparation of magnetic nanocellulose is mainly based on heterogeneous preparation. Magnetic nanofiber cellulose has great application potential in the field of biomedicine and sewage purification due to its special magnetic properties. It can also be applied to sensors, food packaging and other fields. In this paper, the preparation methods of magnetic nanocellulose and its physical magnetism are introduced. Then, the application of magnetic nanocellulose in different fields is reviewed. Finally, the current challenges of magnetic nanocellulose are summarized and the future development trend is prospected.

AB As commonly observed water pollutants, organophosphates (OPs) can induce eutrophication of water bodies and pose serious risks to the environment and human health. In this study, we investigated the degradation of tetramethylphosphonate (THPS), an OP, using micron-scale iron-copper (Fe/Cu) bimetals activated peracetic acid (PAA) system. Interestingly, the iron groups (i.e., Fe, Fe/Cu and Fe-PAA system) exhibited a biphasic response: an initial rapid response within the first 10 min followed by a slower degradation lasting from 10 to 60 min. However, the copper groups (i.e., Cu, Cu-PAA and Fe/Cu-PAA) exhibited an initial response within the first 10 min coupled with a subsequent plateau with no significant alterations thereafter. In terms of reactive oxidized species (ROS) verification, only hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) was detected in the Fe and Fe-PAA systems; only singlet oxygen (1O2) was detected in the Cu system; organic radicals (R-O center dot) and 1 O 2 were detected in the Cu-PAA and Fe/Cu-PAA systems respectively; while center dot OH, R-O center dot and 1 O 2 were all detected in the Fe/Cu-PAA system. The presence of Cu promoted the release of electrons from iron and strengthened the single-electron transfer mode. Notably, after five consecutive runs, the removal efficiency of THPS remained above 80 %, and the k obs during the first ten minutes (11.28, 10.11, 9.12, 8.29, and 8.45 min-1 ) remained high and stable throughout the cycles. XPS spectra analysis demonstrated that for 5 cycles, the surface content of Fe0/Fe2+ and Cu0/Cu+ in the utilized materials surpassed that of the pristine Fe/Cu bimetals, indicating the self-renewal of Fe/Cu bimetals. These findings highlight the potential of Fe/Cu bimetals in effectively degrading THPS and reducing its environmental impact.

AB Quercetin, a potent bioactive flavonoid, poses challenges in food applications due to its inherent bitterness. To address this, whey protein isolate (WPI) coatings and insertions have been explored for their potential to mask this undesirable taste. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated a narrowed peak in WPI-coated liposomes, indicating a more stable structure compared to those with WPI insertion. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) results demonstrated increased mucin adsorbing capacity in WPI-coated liposomes relative to their inserted counterparts. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data indicated that WPI coatings, particularly at higher concentrations, significantly improved the thermal stability of the liposomes. Antioxidant tests indicated that liposomes modified with WPI, especially those coated at a concentration of 3 mg/mL, effectively inhibited lipid peroxidation, achieving the strongest effect at 49.65 +/- 2.10%. Furthermore, in vitro digestion assays suggested that both coating and inserting modifications at 2 mg/mL substantially maintained the structural integrity of quercetin liposomes, minimized quercetin leakage, and enhanced its bioavailability, with the most notable improvement observed in liposomes with WPI insertion. The findings suggest that WPI-modifications enhanced the physical stability and functional properties of quercetin-loaded liposomes, supporting their potential use as a delivery system for bitter bioactive compounds in the development of functional foods.

AB Cloud-edge-end computing architecture is crucial for large-scale edge data processing and analysis. However, the diversity of terminal nodes and task complexity in this architecture often result in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making it challenging to balance data heterogeneity and privacy protection. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning method based on cloud-edge-end collaboration. Our method fully considers the three-tier architecture of cloud-edge-end systems and the non-IID nature of terminal node data. It enhances model accuracy while protecting the privacy of terminal node data. The proposed method groups terminal nodes based on the similarity of their data distributions and constructs edge subnetworks for training in collaboration with edge nodes, thereby mitigating the negative impact of non-IID data. Furthermore, we enhance WGAN-GP with attention mechanism to generate balanced synthetic data while preserving key patterns from original datasets, reducing the adverse effects of non-IID data on global model accuracy while preserving data privacy. In addition, we introduce data resampling and loss function weighting strategies to mitigate model bias caused by imbalanced data distribution. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of model accuracy, F1-score, and other metrics.

AB Treating infected wounds is facing a serious challenge due to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance worldwide. In the search for novel antimicrobial drugs, natural products often serve as a crucial resource. Plumbagin (PLB) is the most important natural active ingredient in the root of Plumbago zeylanica L. known for its excellent antibacterial ability. However, the application of PLB is limited because of its poor water solubility, instability, and tendency to sublimate. In this study, we propose a solution by designing a hyaluronic acid (HA)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) dissolving microneedle patch loaded with PLB/hydroxypropyl-(3-cyclodextrin (HP-(3-CD) inclusion complex. PLB was encapsulated into the cavity of HP-(3-CD to improve its solubility and stability using the neutralization agitation method. The formation of the inclusion complex significantly increased the water solubility of PLB to 1350 f 6.8 mu g/mL, which is 17 times higher than its original value of 79.3 f 1.7 mu g/mL. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be 94.82 f 3.34 %. In vitro drug release studies, PLB microneedles loaded with PLB/HP-(3-CD inclusion complex rapidly released into PBS within 15 min. Furthermore, the PLB microneedles exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) both in vivo and in vitro. They also remarkably accelerated the healing of infected wounds in mice by enhancing collagen deposition and re-epithelialization, reducing inflammation, and stimulating angiogenesis. Overall, this multifunctional microneedle patch shows promising potential for clinical applications in the healing of infected wounds.

AB Spore-forming bacteria (SFB), like Bacillus, are the gram-positive bacteria with broad-spectrum activity that is one of the commonly used strains of probiotics. However, these bacteria also have significant resistance. In this study, we systematically investigated pig manure, manure slurry and soil by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture techniques. We found the SFB was widespread in manure, manure slurry and soil, Firmicutes was one of the main dominant phyla in pig manure, manure slurry and soil, the relative abundance of Bacillus were 0.98%, 0.01%, and 2.57%, respectively, and metals such as copper have complex relationships with bacteria. We isolated 504 SFB from 369 samples, with the highest number identified as Bacillus subtilis. SFB strains showed varying degrees of antibiotic resistance; the greatest against erythromycin, followed by imipenem. The MICs of SFB varied greatly against different heavy metals; with high (est) resistance against Zn2+, followed by Cu2+. Second-generation whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that nine Bacillus strains carried different subtypes of vancomycin resistance genes, among which vanRM had the highest frequency. The strain W129 included the vanRA-vanRM-vanSA-vanZF cluster. The nine Bacillus strains also contained antibiotic genes such as aminoglycoside ( ant(9)-Ia ), beta-lactam (bcII), and macrolide (msrE). Twenty-six Bacillus isolates carried copper resistance clusters, including csoR-copZ, copA-copZ-csoR, and copZ-copA. WGS showed that strain W166 carried 11 vancomycin resistance genes and 11 copper resistance genes. There were 4 vancomycin resistance genes and 14 copper resistance genes on the W129 chromosome. Strain W129 also harbors the plasmid pLKYM01 that contains an intact transposon consisting of insertion sequence and vancomycin resistance genes vanYF and vanRA. This study explores the potential risks of using pig manure and fertilized soil to inform safe and effective use of probiotics in agriculture. It highlights scientific evidence for concern over the safe utilization and control of animal waste products.

AB Land use change is a key factor affecting the carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems. Most studies focus on formulating different land development strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts of land development, while fewer discuss the effectiveness of these strategies. In the context of varying socio-economic development and limited budgets for ecological conservation, evaluating effectiveness is essential for selecting the most suitable land development strategy. This research proposed a Patch-Generating Land Use Simulation-Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs-Propensity Score Matching (PLUS-InVEST-PSM) model to evaluate the effectiveness of different land use development strategies in the Greater Bay Area of China as a case study. Specifically, this study analyzed the historical land use changes from 2000 to 2020 and mapped the multi-scenario patterns of land use and carbon storage with the PLUS and the InVEST models from 2030 to 2050. Then, this study employed the PSM model, along with a series of criteria (i.e., similar ecological backgrounds and parallel historical trends), to evaluate the effectiveness of the ecological development strategy and ecological protection redlines on carbon storage compared with the natural development strategy. The results indicate that the ecological development strategy and the ecological protection redline can prevent the decline in carbon storage. However, in the ecological development strategy, implementing the ecological redline policy may hinder the growth of carbon storage within the ecological redline area. Compared with the PLUS-InVEST-PSM model, the comparison between the subregions could underestimate the efficiencies of evaluation, partly due to underestimating the negative impact of urban development on carbon storage. These findings will help governments develop comprehensive and systematic land use policies to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. Also, the approach would help to further explore the broader impacts of land use development strategies on the overall regional ecological environment, such as biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB The goat breeding industry on the Tibetan Plateau faces strong selection pressure to enhance fertility. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop goat lines with higher fertility and adaptability. The ovary, as a key organ determining reproductive performance, is regulated by a complex transcriptional network involving numerous protein-coding and non-coding genes. However, the molecular mechanisms of the key mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory network in goat ovaries remain largely unknown. This study focused on the histology and differential mRNA/miRNA/lncRNA between Chuanzhong black goat (CBG, high productivity, multiple births) and Tibetan goat (TG, strong adaptability, single birth) ovaries. Histomorphological analysis showed that the medulla proportion in CBG ovaries was significantly reduced compared to TG. RNA-Seq and small RNA-Seq analysis identified 1218 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, 100 DE miRNAs, and 326 DE lncRNAs, which were mainly enriched in ovarian steroidogenesis, oocyte meiosis, biosynthesis of amino acids and protein digestion, and absorption signaling pathways. Additionally, five key mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks regulating goat reproductive performance were identified, including TCL1B-novel68_mature-ENSCHIT00000010023, AKAP6-novel475_mature-ENSCHIT00000003176, GLI2-novel68_mature-XR_001919123.1, ITGB5-novel65_star-TCONS_00013850, and VWA2-novel71_mature-XR_001919911.1. Further analyses showed that these networks mainly affected ovarian function and reproductive performance by regulating biological processes such as germ cell development and oocyte development, which also affected the plateau adaptive capacity of the ovary by participating in the individual immune and metabolic capacities. In conclusion, we identified numerous mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks involved in regulating ovarian function and reproductive performance in goats. This discovery offers new insights into the molecular breeding of Tibetan Plateau goats and provides a theoretical foundation for developing new goat lines with high reproductive capacity and strong adaptability to the plateau environment.

AB Currently, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer therapy. However, limited indications hinder their further application. Repression of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) can block the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway and has the potential to enhance the response to PARPi in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer therapy. In addition, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) can hijack E3 ligase within the cell to ubiquitinate degradation-targeted proteins effectively and quickly, thus enhancing the therapeutic effect on tumors. In the present study, the LB23 compound, which induces PARP1 degradation, was employed in combination with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1, confirming their synergistic effect in HR-proficient pancreatic cancer through various methods. Moreover, compared to the JQ1 and PARPi olaparib combination, PARP1-PROTAC and JQ1 had more notable synergistic effects. Further research into the synergistic mechanism demonstrated that combination therapy enhanced DNA damage and suppressed DNA repair by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. The present study therefore provides the experimental data for this type of combination therapy, which is expected to be an innovative approach for the treatment of HR-proficient pancreatic cancer.

AB Yaks are grazed extensively on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has a long history of semidomestication. The predicted weight of yaks over consecutive years helps make strategic decisions when selecting yak calves for breeding. To achieve more accurate predictions of genomic estimated breeding values, we used a dataset comprising the genotype and weight records of 396 Maiwa yaks collected from 2015 to 2020. We compared the predictive accuracy of the genome best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model with that of six other models. Based on the GBLUP model, we applied two prediction strategies. In the first strategy, the year was treated as a fixed effect in the GBLUP model, and the kinship from all individuals and the markers were treated as random effects. In the second strategy, all individuals were divided into six age groups, with GBLUP performed for each group, and the phenotypes of the closest age groups were treated as fixed effects. Although the GBLUP model provided better prediction accuracy than other single-trait models, most of the predictive capacity was derived from the best linear unbiased estimation. Additionally, incorporating the phenotype of the closest age group as a factor in multitrait prediction enhanced the accuracy of the model. Our findings provide a robust and credible strategy for predicting continuous economic traits in the presence of strong correlations. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB BackgroundLiver fibrosis is a common pathological process of chronic liver disease, characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been found to have potential therapy effect on liver fibrosis, but the mechanism involved was still unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) on the treatment of liver fibrosis, with particular emphasis on elucidating the underlying mechanism of action through which ADMSCs inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).MethodsADMSCs were isolated from adipose tissue and injected intravenously into hepatic fibrosis model of rats. The histopathological changes, liver function, collagen deposition, the expression of fibroin and Hippo pathway were evaluated. In vitro, ADMSCs were co-cultured with HSCs activated by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and the inhibitor of Hippo pathway was used to evaluate the therapeutic mechanism of ADMSCs transplantation.ResultsThe results showed that after the transplantation of ADMSCs, the liver function of rats was improved, the degree of liver fibrosis and collagen deposition were reduced, and the Hippo signaling pathway was activated. In vitro, ADMSCs can effectively inhibit the proliferation and activation of HSCs induced by TGF-beta 1 treatment. However, the inhibitory effect of ADMSCs was weakened after blocking the Hippo signaling pathway.ConclusionsADMSCs inhibit HSCs activation by regulating YAP/TAZ, thereby promoting functional recovery after liver fibrosis. These findings lay a foundation for further investigation into the precise mechanism by which ADMSCs alleviate liver fibrosis.

AB Cholesterol (CHO) is an essential constituent of human cellular tissues and a crucial activity indicator for the clinical diagnosis and prevention of various diseases. Abnormal CHO levels can lead to various cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, cerebral thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. Thus, developing simple and effective methods for CHO detection is of great significance. Herein, a novel calix[6]arene-modified photonic hydrogel biosensor (PAAH@SCX6) was developed for naked-eye monitoring of CHO based on supramolecular host-guest interactions between 4-sulfocalix[6]arene (SCX6) and CHO molecules. This sensor was constructed by embedding Fe3O4 colloidal nanocrystal cluster chains into a poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) smart hydrogel (PAAH), followed by incorporation of plentiful SCX6 units into the PAAH via hydrogen bonding interactions. The specific recognition of SCX6 to CHO leads to the volume expansion of the hydrogel, causing a shift in the photonic band gap and a change in the hydrogel's structural color. The sensor demonstrated a linear detection range of 2.83-5.20 mM, covering the typical CHO levels in the human body. Importantly, the PAAH@SCX6 biosensor showed high selectivity and satisfactory stability, making it highly suitable for practical applications. Such a photonic hydrogel-based biosensor provides a convenient, simple, and efficient strategy for visual CHO detection.

AB NLRP12, a member of the NLR family, has been shown to exert a vital function in orchestrating immune responses. Here, using the immunosuppressive porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) as a model, the role of NLRP12 in virus infection was deciphered. We demonstrated that overexpression of NLRP12 significantly restrained PRRSV replication, while NLRP12 silencing resulted in increased viral titer. Mechanistically, NLRP12 interacts with glycoprotein 2a (GP2a) through its LRR domain and recruits the membrane- associated RING-CH E3 ubiquitin ligase 8 (MARCH8) via the PYD domain. NLRP12 facilitates the lysine-48 (K48)-linked polyubiquitination of GP2a at K128 and induces its lysosome degradation via the MARCH8NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa) pathway. To counteract this, PRRSV Nsp2 effectively prevented the polyubiquitination of GP2a induced by NLRP12 by its deubiquitinating activity. Meanwhile, the overexpression of Nsp4 decreased the mRNA of endogenous NLRP12 and cleaved NLRP12 in a 3C-like protease activity-dependent manner, which collaboratively counteracts the antiviral function of NLRP12. Collectively, this study revealed the mechanisms of the NLRP12-MARCH8-NDP52 axis in the host defense against PRRSV, which might be harnessed for the development of anti-PRRSV therapies.

AB Climate warming can be detrimental to biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. Numerous studies have examined the effect of warming on ecosystem multifunctionality; however, little is known about how long-term warming affects ecosystem multifunctionality and its seasonal dynamics. Here, we determined the effects of longterm (10 years) in-situ soil warming on multitrophic diversity (plants, soil bacteria, soil fungi, arthropods, and nematodes) and soil multifunctionality in an alpine meadow. The effects of warming on multitrophic diversity were inconsistent, showing a positive effect on soil microbial diversity, including bacterial diversity and fungal diversity, in the upper layer (0-10 cm), a negative effect on plant diversity, and no effect on soil fauna diversity in either the upper (0-10 cm) or lower soil layers (10-20 cm). Warming had a minor effect on soil multi- functionality, and reduced seasonal differences in soil multifunctionality in upper soil layers, but expanded the differences in the lower soil layers. Based on structural equation models, both abiotic factors (soil water content and soil pH) and biotic factors (microbial diversity and fauna diversity) jointly influenced soil multifunctionality, with abiotic factors having a greater effect than biotic factors. The findings provide insights in the important effects of long-term warming on seasonal dynamics of soil multifunctionality, and the crucial role of multitrophic diversity for maintaining the sustainable development of the alpine ecosystem under climate warming.

AB Targeting senescent cells has recently emerged as a promising strategy for treating age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis, which significantly contributes to global cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review elucidates the role of senescent cells in the development of atherosclerosis, including persistently damaging DNA, inducing oxidative stress and secreting pro-inflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Therapeutic approaches targeting senescent cells to mitigate atherosclerosis are summarized in this review, which include the development of senotherapeutics and immunotherapies. These therapies are designed to either remove these cells or suppress their deleterious effects. These emerging therapies hold potential to decelerate or even alleviate the progression of AS, paving the way for new avenues in cardiovascular research and treatment.

AB Thermoelectric generators held great promise through energy harvesting from waste heat. Their practical application, however, is greatly constrained by poor raw material utilization and tedious processing in fabricating desired shapes. Herein, a state-of-the-art process is reported for 3D printing the half-Heusler (Nb0.88Hf0.12FeSb) thermoelectric material using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The multi-dimensional intra- and inter-granular defects created by this process greatly suppress thermal conductivity by providing numerous phonon scattering centers. The resulting LPBF-fabricated half-Heusler exhibits a high figure of merit approximate to 1.2 at 923 K and a single-leg maximum efficiency of approximate to 3.3% at a temperature difference (Delta T) of 371 K. Hafnium oxide nanoparticles generated during LPBF effectively prevent crack propagation, ensuring competent mechanical performance and reliable thermoelectric output. The findings highlight the significant potential of LPBF in driving the next industrial revolution of highly efficient and customizable thermoelectric materials.

AB The alternative oxidase (AOX), a common terminal oxidase in the electron transfer chain (ETC) of plants, plays a crucial role in stress resilience and plant growth and development. Oat (Avena sativa), an important crop with high nutritional value, has not been comprehensively studied regarding the AsAOX gene family. Therefore, this study explored the responses and potential functions of the AsAOX gene family to various abiotic stresses and their potential evolutionary pathways. Additionally, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to explore the evolutionary conservation and divergence of AOX gene families among three Avena species (Avena sativa, Avena insularis, Avena longiglumis) and four Poaceae species (Avena sativa, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, and Brachypodium distachyon). We identified 12 AsAOX, 9 AiAOX, and 4 AlAOX gene family members. Phylogenetic, motif, domain, gene structure, and selective pressure analyses revealed that most AsAOXs, AiAOXs, and AlAOXs are evolutionarily conserved. We also identified 16 AsAOX segmental duplication pairs, suggesting that segmental duplication may have contributed to the expansion of the AsAOX gene family, potentially preserving these genes through subfunctionalization. Chromosome polyploidization, gene structural variations, and gene fragment recombination likely contributed to the evolution and expansion of the AsAOX gene family as well. Additionally, we hypothesize that AsAOX2 may have potential function in resisting wounding and heat stresses, while AsAOX4 could be specifically involved in mitigating wounding stress. AsAOX11 might contribute to resistance against chromium and waterlogging stresses. AsAOX8 may have potential fuction in mitigating ABA-mediated stress. AsAOX12 and AsAOX5 are most likely to have potential function in mitigating salt and drought stresses, respectively. This study elucidates the potential evolutionary pathways of the AsAOXs gene family, explores their responses and potential functions to various abiotic stresses, identifies potential candidate genes for future functional studies, and facilitates molecular breeding applications in A. sativa.

AB In case of emergency, evacuation signs play an important role in guiding people to evacuate safety exits in large space buildings. Large space buildings are characterized by high ceilings and large areas. In the existing legislation and standards, the height setting of evacuation signs is fixed, but the influence of height changes on the visibility of evacuation signs is very important. This study fully considers the relationship between the height setting change of evacuation signs and the visual range and puts forward a smart safety design strategy for evacuation signs. The smart safety design consists of two parts, one is the mathematical relationship between the height change of evacuation signs and the visual range of personnel, and the other is the integration of the application process of smart devices. Firstly, the visual range of two different sizes of evacuation signs placed at the height of 1.7 to 6 m was measured experimentally in China. The results showed that: (1) with an increase in the height of the evacuation signs, their viewing distance gradually decreased and the visual range was reduced; (2) the mathematical model of the change between the height and the visual range of evacuation signs was established; (3) the height of evacuation signs between 3 to 5 m agreed more with the visual habits of the people. Then, on this basis, the smart safety design method can use related mathematical models to set the evacuation signs at the optimal height based on the actual distance between people and evacuation signs, ensuring that people can see the signs the first time, thus providing evacuation guidance for evacuees and improving the safety of large space buildings.

TI Spatio-temporally controlled all-in-one hydrogel microspheres for
   ulcerative colitis treatment based on cocktail strategy
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL

DE Ulcerative colitis; Nanoparticles in microspheres; Nanozymes; Berberine;
   Gut microbiota; Macrophage polarization
ID DELIVERY; MAGNOLOL
AB Due to the complex pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), particularly excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), gut microbiota dysbiosis, and hyperpolarization of M1 macrophages, the cocktail strategy is urgently needed to obtain a sufficient therapeutic outcome. Meanwhile, the accurate lesion location targeting of these combined therapeutic agents is still crucial. Herein, based on NPs-in-MPs approach, a novel integrated "all-in-one" oral delivery system (BMM/MPs), containing the natural gut microbiota regulator berberine, MnO2 nanoenzymes, and cell penetrating peptides-decorated magnolol liposomes to regulate macrophage polarization, was constructed to address these above issues in sequence. BMM/MPs could non-destructively cross the gastrointestinal tract, enduringly detain, and dissociate in the colon site due to the pH-sensitive properties. Conceivably, the released MnO2 nanoenzymes depleted the excess ROS at the colitis location into O2, sequentially promoting the acceleration of hydrogel microspheres rupture and oxidative damage remission. Accordingly, the oral administration of BMM/MPs exhibited remarkably satisfactory therapeutic effects against DSS-induced UC mice, by ameliorating the representative symptoms, scavenging ROS, relieving inflammation, and inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization at colon sites. Meanwhile, the dysbiosis of microbes was effectively regulated by facilitating SCFAs production. This study provides a feasible strategy for administration in the treatment of UC.

AB Effective regulation of transition metal spinel morphology is crucial for stable bifunctional catalysts in the electrocatalysis of water. In this work, we crafted a fine NiCo2O4 (F-NCO) microflower structure assembled by nanosheet arrays, which exhibited highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outperforming most of the previous transition metal catalysts. Electronic microscope analysis revealed that the thickness of the F-NCO catalyst was only 1.6 nm, much smaller than that (58.8 nm) of bulk NiCo2O4 (B-NCO), and the ultrathin lamellar structure facilitated the exposure of active sites and improved the reaction kinetics. Compared with the B-NCO catalyst, the overpotential of the F-NCO catalyst in HER and OER was reduced by 36 and 82 mV, the active surface area increased by 2.68 and 4.16 times, and the charge transfer resistance values were reduced by 0.42 and 0.61 times, respectively. In the assembled cell, F-NCO/CFP(+)||FNCO/CFP(- ) electrolyzer was able to achieve 10 mA cm- 2 at a low cell voltage of 1.74 V, which was much lower than B-NCO/CFP(+)||B-NCO/CFP(- ) electrolyzer. In the 12-hour stability test, the potentiometric time dropped by only 30 mV, lower than 70 mV of the B-NCO catalyst. This work presents a facile strategy for developing a bifunctional catalyst for the electrocatalysis of water.

AB The formation pathway and mechanism of various pyrazines were investigated during the thermal treatment of the alanine-xylose Amadori compound (Ala-ARP) and exogenous alanine (Ala). N-15-labeled Ala was used to coheated with Ala-ARP to clarify the nitrogen sources and the respective contributions of exogenous Ala and the regenerated Ala released from Ala-ARP to different pyrazine formation. It was found that exogenous Ala exhibited a priority in capturing glyoxal (GO) to form pyrazine during the thermal degradation of ARP. Compared to the Ala-methylglyoxal (MGO) model, a lower activation energy was required for the Ala-GO reaction, where the reaction dynamics of Ala-GO followed a zero-order model. In addition to forming pyrazine, the interaction between existing exogenous Ala and GO would accelerate the thermal degradation of Ala-ARP and retro-aldolization reaction of deoxyxylosones (DXs) to alpha-dicarbonyls. During this process, the release of regenerated Ala and MGO was promoted. Accordingly, as GO was expended by exogenous Ala during the initial stage of ARP-Ala degradation, the condensation between regenerated Ala and MGO became intensified, leading to the generation of methylpyrazine and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. As a result, in the thermally treated mixture of Ala-ARP and exogenous Ala, 55% of the formed pyrazine originated from exogenous Ala, while 63% of the formed methylpyrazine and 57% of the formed 2,5-dimethylpyrazine were derived from regenerated Ala (120 degrees C, 30 min).

AB Simple Summary Comparative analysis of the gut microbiota in wild grazing (WG) and domestic grazing (DG) yaks reveals distinct differences in bacterial diversity, with WG animals exhibiting a higher diversity than DG animals. Firmicutes dominate both groups, with a greater abundance in the WG type, indicating a stronger fiber-degrading capacity. WG yaks have a higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae families, which are known for their role in fiber degradation, and genus-level differences show a greater presence of fiber-degrading microbes, such as Ruminococcus and Rikenella. In contrast, DG yaks have a higher abundance of Prevotellaceae, Alloprevotella, and Succinivibrio, associated with protein and carbohydrate degradation, reflecting their different dietary habits. These differences in gut microbiota composition suggest that feeding patterns are crucial in shaping the microbial community, influencing yak health and environmental adaptation. The findings presented herein have significant implications for livestock production, highlighting the importance of considering the impact of grazing practices on gut microbiota, and providing valuable insights for developing prebiotics and microbiological agents tailored to specific dietary needs. The gut microbiota is a diverse and complex population, and it has a key role in the host's health and adaptability to the environment. The present study investigated the fecal bacterial community of wild grazing (WG) and domestic grazing (DG) yaks on natural grazing pastures, analyzing the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing to assess bacterial diversity. A total of 48 yak fecal samples were selected from two different grazing habitats. The DG group had more crude proteins and non-fiber carbohydrates. The WG group had more OM, insoluble dietary fiber such as NDF, ADF, ether extract, and TC. There were 165 and 142 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the WG and DG groups, respectively. Shannon index analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity in the WG group than in the DG group. At the phylum level, Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial taxa in both groups. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the WG group was higher than in the DG group. At the family level, the WG group had a significantly higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae (p < 0.001) and Rikenellaceae (p < 0.001) than the DG group. The abundances of Alloprevotella and Succinivibrio were more pronounced in the DG group than in the WG group at the genus level. This study presents a novel understanding of the bacterial communities of ruminants and their potential applications for livestock production.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in food are key factors constituting their unique flavor, while the characteristics of VOCs in air-dried yak meat (AYM) from various regions of the Tibetan Plateau and their inter-regional differences remain unclear. Therefore, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis of VOCs in the five-spice (FS), spicy and numbing (SN), and aromatic and spicy (AS) versions of AYM from four regions of the Tibetan Plateau (Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Tibet) using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) A total of 58 VOCs were identified, with alcohols accounting for 28.40%, ketones 22.89%, aldehydes 18.85%, and terpenes 17.61%. Topographic plots, fingerprint profiles, and multivariate analysis not only distinguished AYM of the same flavor from different regions but also discriminated those of different flavors within the same region. Furthermore, 17 key VOCs were selected as the primary aroma characteristics of the 12 types of AYM, including linalool, 3-methylbutanal, acetone, and limonene. Meanwhile, the differential VOCs for each flavor were determined, with linalyl acetate being unique to the FS, (E)-ocimene and ethyl propanoate being specific to the SN, and 2-methyl-3-(methylthio)furan-D and Hexanal-D being characteristic of the AS flavor. Based on the above results, the flavor of AYM can be improved to suit the taste of most people and increase its consumption.

AB The poor compatibility of ester electrolytes with lithium metal anode severely limits its use in high voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, a bidentate solvent 1,2-diethoxyethane (DEE) is introduced into ester electrolyte to regulate the ion-dipole interactions to enhance the solubility of LiNO3, 3 , which enables compatibility with Li anode and maintains the high voltage cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, the steric effect of DEE facilitates the participation of NO3 3 - and PF6- 6- anions in the Li' ' solvation structure, thus promoting the generation of inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). And the low viscosity of DEE also ensures that the ester electrolyte poses good interfacial wettability. As a result, our designed electrolyte enables the high-loading Li||NCM622 and Li||NCM811 (similar to 3 mA h cm-2 ) full cells to achieve stable cycling over 200 cycles, 8 times longer than that of a conventional ester electrolyte. This work suggests that regulation of intermolecular interactions in conventional ester electrolytes is a scalable and effective approach to achieve excellent electrochemical performance of LMBs.

AB Barium ions (Ba 2+ ) contamination is a serious environmental problem worldwide. The currently existing Ba 2+- detection techniques are generally expensive, time-consuming, and complicated. Therefore, the development of a simple, inexpensive, rapid, and effective strategy to detect Ba 2+ in water is of great importance. Herein, we first report a smart photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor for simple, highly selective, and naked-eye detection of Ba 2+ in water based on 18-crown-6/Ba 2+ host - guest interactions. This sensor was composed of a poly(benzo-18crown-6-acrylamide- co- N-isopropylacrylamide- co-acrylamide) (PBCNA) intelligent hydrogel with embedding Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs). The prepared PBCNA PCH sensor demonstrated pH and temperature-dependent Ba 2+-detection performances. Besides, the Ba 2+-responded PCH sensor could be easily regenerated via simple washing using hot/cold water at least 20 times without compromising its detection performance. Such a PCH sensor with obvious advantages of portability, ease of operation, cost-effectiveness, high selectivity and excellent regenerability, provides a simple and effective strategy to monitor Ba 2+ in contaminated water.

AB Electric power operation, as one of the key fields in the world, faces particularly prominent safety issues. Ensuring the safety of operators has become the most fundamental requirement in power operation. However, there are some safety hazards in power construction. These hazards are mainly due to weak safety awareness among staff and the failure to standardize the wearing of safety helmets. In order to effectively address this situation, technical means such as video surveillance technology and computer vision technology can be utilized to monitor whether staff are wearing helmets and provide timely feedback. Such measures will greatly enhance the safety level of power operation. This paper proposes an improved lightweight helmet detection algorithm named YOLO-M3C. The algorithm first replaces the YOLOv5s backbone network with MobileNetV3, successfully reducing the model size from 13.7 MB to 10.2 MB, thereby increasing the model's detection speed from 42.0 frames per second to 55.6 frames per second. Then, the CA attention mechanism is introduced into the backbone network to enhance the feature extraction capability of the model. Finally, in order to further improve the detection recall rate and accuracy of the model, a knowledge distillation of the model was carried out. The experimental results show that, compared with the original YOLOv5s algorithm, the average accuracy of the improved YOLO-M3C algorithm is improved by 0.123, and the recall rate is the same. These results verify that the algorithm YOLO-M3C has excellent performance in target detection and recognition, which can improve accuracy and confidence, while reducing false detection and missing detection, and effectively meet the needs of helmet-wearing detection.

AB In ecologically fragile areas heavily affected by human disturbance, it is imperative to restore soil quality to preserve nutrient cycling and ensure ecosystem stability. However, our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of dynamic change in soil quality associated with revegetation in alpine areas remains incomplete. In this study, data from 96 plots were collected to reveal the response of soil quality to vegetation restoration in alpine mines. The soil quality index (SQI) was developed utilizing 19 measured indicators to assess differences in soil quality between various vegetation restoration modes (natural restoration (CK), planting with Elymus dahuricus (ED), Medicago sativa (MS), and multi-plant mixed (Avena fatua L. + Elymus dahuricus + Medicago sativa + Oxytropis coerulea, MM)) and restoration periods (1, 3, 4, and 6 years). A partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was constructed to recognize the impact of 14 variables related to topographical features, plant biodiversity and community stability, aboveground plant productivity characteristics, root functional traits, and soil erosion on soil quality. The results revealed significant variations in soil quality among different vegetation restoration modes. Within the initial four years following vegetation restoration, the discernible discrepancies in SQI values were as follows: ED > MM > MS > CK; by the sixth year, the order shifted to MM > ED > MS > CK. Aboveground plant productivity characteristics and functional root traits significantly contribute to soil quality. In contrast, plant biodiversity and community stability had no significant effects on soil quality. Topographical features and soil erosion adversely affected soil quality, with soil erosion exerting the most prominent effect.

AB The production of photocatalytic materials with strong light absorption ability and high quantum efficiency by simple means is a long-term goal of photocatalytic technology. In this work, we have synthesized Cu doped ZnO nanoparticles by a facile sol-gel method. By introducing Cu impurities, it is shown that the excitons in ZnO have been efficiently separated into free carriers, leading to optimized photocatalytic performance. The surface amorphous layers of the nanoparticles grew thicker at the introduction of Cu atoms into ZnO lattice, which boosted the photocatalytic ability due to the increase of surface oxygen vacancy concentration. This finding provides a direct evidence of quasi -particle -free carrier conversion in Cu doped ZnO, as well as a guidance for fabricating high efficiency ZnO based nanophotocatalysts.

AB To overcome the adverse effect of high-frequency output power fluctuation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) on its operational performance, this work proposes a virtual inertia-based control (VIC) method for the hybrid powertrain of HEVs with the PEMFC and battery, which is derived from the dynamic behavior of synchronous generators. The VIC is employed as the primary layer to control the PEMFC output power, and a VIC-based power management strategy (VIC-PMS) is also proposed as the upper layer to distribute the power flow of the hybrid powertrain. The VIC can restrain the high-frequency fluctuation of the output power of the PEMFC so that it only has to afford low-frequency power, while the battery is passively subjected to high-frequency power. Furthermore, the output or input impedance model of each unit is developed, and then the stability analysis of the system by utilizing the impedance stability criterion is implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed VIC and VIC-PMS is verified by the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test platform. The results are that the VIC can restrain the PEMFC high-frequency power fluctuation successfully, and the VIC-PMS can manage the power distribution of the hybrid powertrain effectively.

AB Soy isoflavones (SIF) are bioactive compounds with low bioavailability due to their poor water solubility. In this study, we utilized polymerized goat milk whey protein (PGWP) as a carrier to encapsulate SIF with encapsulation efficiency of 89%, particle size of 135.53 nm, and zeta potential of -35.16 mV. The PGWP-SIF nanoparticles were evaluated for their stability and in vitro digestion properties, and their ability to transport SIF was assessed using a Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The nanoparticles were resistant to aggregation when subjected to pH changes (pH 2.0 to 8.0), sodium chloride addition (0-200 mM), temperature fluctuations (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C), and long-term storage (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 30 days), which was mainly attributed to the repulsion generated by steric hindrance effects. During gastric digestion, only 5.93% of encapsulated SIF was released, highlighting the nanoparticles' resistance to enzymatic digestion in the stomach. However, a significant increase in SIF release to 56.61% was observed during intestinal digestion, indicating the efficient transport of SIF into the small intestine for absorption. Cytotoxicity assessments via the MTT assay showed no adverse effects on Caco-2 cell lines after encapsulation. The PGWP-stabilized SIF nanoparticles improved the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of Caco-2 cells for SIF by 11.8-fold. The results indicated that using PGWP to encapsulate SIF was an effective approach for delivering SIF, while enhancing its bioavailability and transcellular transport.

AB Mycoplasma species are able to produce and release secreted proteins, such as toxins, adhesins, and virulence-related enzymes, involved in bacteria adhesion, invasion, and immune evasion between the pathogen and host. Here, we investigated a novel secreted protein, MbovP0725, from Mycoplasma bovis encoding a putative haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) hydrolase function of a key serine/threonine phosphatase depending on Mg2+ for the dephosphorylation of its substrate pNPP, and it was most active at pH 8 to 9 and temperatures around 40degree celsius. A transposon insertion mutant strain of M. bovis HB0801 that lacked the protein MbovP0725 induced a stronger inflammatory response but with a partial reduction of adhesion ability. Using transcriptome sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis, we found that the mutant was upregulated by the mRNA expression of genes from the glycolysis pathway, while downregulated by the genes enriched in ABC transporters and acetate kinase-phosphate acetyltransferase pathway. Untargeted metabolomics showed that the disruption of the Mbov_0725 gene caused the accumulation of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids and the consumption of cytidine 5'-monophosphate, uridine monophosphate, and adenosine monophosphate. Both the exogenous and endogenous MbvoP0725 protein created by purification and transfection inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha mRNA production and could also attenuate the activation of MAPK-associated pathways after LPS treatment. A pull-down assay identified MAPK p38 and ERK as potential substrates for MbovP0725. These findings define metabolism- and virulence-related roles for a HAD family phosphatase and reveal its ability to inhibit the host pro-inflammatory response.

AB The development of high-performance polymer-based nanocomposites in the field of organic film capacitors in high-temperature environments needs to address two key issues: the controllable construction of nanofillers and the enhancement of the temperature resistance characteristics within the polymer matrix. In this study, an effective method was proposed to prepare functional nanohybrids consisting of three-dimensional "wintersweetlike" barium titanate (BT) attached to halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) though polydopamine and polyethyleneimine co-modification (H-B@PP). These nano-hybrids are subsequently incorporated into polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) matrix, resulting in the fabrication of functional nanocomposite films (PEN/H-B@PP). Ultimately, the highly thermally stable PEN-based nanocomposite films were obtained via a solid-phase crosslinking reaction (CPEN/H-B@PP). The microstructure, surface morphology of nano-hybrids and the mechanical, thermal and dielectric properties of nanocomposite films were investigated comprehensively. The results reveal that when the content of H-B@PP is 10 wt%, the tensile strength and modulus of the nanocomposite film reach 107.7 MPa and 2230.4 MPa, which are 5.28 % and 10.08 % higher than those of the pure PEN film, respectively. Additionally, the dielectric constant of nanocomposites containing 40 wt% nanofillers is 3.82 times that of pure PEN, while the dielectric loss is only below 0.04 at 1 kHz. Furthermore, the thermal stability of all nanocomposite films is further enhanced after the crosslinking reaction. Moreover, the dielectric constant-temperature coefficient of CPEN nanocomposites remains below 5 x 10(-4) C- 1 within the temperature range of 25-220 C-degrees. All in all, this work presents a fabrication strategy for novel high-temperature resistant nanocomposite films, thereby expanding the potential applications of dielectric films in harsh environments.

AB Soil asymbiotic nitrogen (N) fixation provides a critical N source to support plant growth in alpine grasslands, and precipitation change is expected to lead to shifts in soil asymbiotic N fixation. However, large gaps remain in understanding the response of soil asymbiotic N fixation to precipitation gradients. Here we simulated five precipitation gradients (10 % (0.1P), 50 % (0.5P), 70 % (0.7P), 100 % (1.0P) and 150 % (1.5P) of the natural precipitation) in an alpine grassland of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and examined the soil nitrogenase activity and N fixation rate for each gradient. Quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing were used to measure the abundance and community composition of the soil nifH DNA (total diazotrophs) and nifH RNA reverse transcription (active diazotrophs) gene. Our results showed that the soil diazotrophic abundance, diversity and nifH gene expression rate peaked under the 0.5P. Soil nitrogenase activity and N fixation rate varied in the range 0.032-0.073 nmol & sdot;C2H4 & sdot;g- & sdot; C 2 H 4 & sdot; g- 1 & sdot;h-1 & sdot; h- 1 and 0.008-0.022 nmol & sdot;N2 & sdot;g- & sdot; N 2 & sdot; g- 1 & sdot;h-1 & sdot; h- 1 respectively, being highest under the 0.5P. The 50 % precipitation reduction enhanced the gene expression rates of Azospirillum and Halorhodospira which were likely responsible for the high N fixation potential. The 0.5P treatment also possessed a larger and more complex active diazotrophic network than the other treatments, which facilitated the resistance of diazotrophic community to environmental stress and thus maintained a high N fixation potential. The active diazotrophic abundance had the largest positive effect on soil N fixation, while nitrate nitrogen had the largest negative effect. Together, our study suggested that appropriate precipitation reduction can enhance soil N fixation through promoting the abundance of the soil active diazotrophs and decreasing soil nitrate nitrogen, and soil active diazotrophs and nitrate nitrogen should be considered in predicting soil N inputs in the alpine grassland of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under precipitation change.

AB This paper studies the finite -time stability via -functions (-FTS) for impulsive dynamical systems (IDS). The notions of -functions, -FTS, and event--FTS are proposed for IDS. The -FTS is a type of well-defined finite -time stability which is expressed via -functions. The -FTS is decomposed into specific types through the decomposition of -functions. By establishing the comparison principles of FTS including -FTS and event -FTS, and by using the decompositions of -functions, the criteria on -FTS and event--FTS are derived for IDS. And with the help of the decompositions of -FTS, the settling time of the -FTS is effectively calculated. Moreover, two types of specific FTS with fixed settling time, i.e., -FTS via resetting state to zero, and event--FTS via Zeno behaviour, are provided. And four examples with numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results. It is shown that the -FTS criteria are less conservative in relaxing the FTS conditions of IDS in the literature. And specific effects of impulses on FTS are given in these -FTS criteria, including that an unstable continuous system may obtain FTS under a finite number of impulses.

This method offers a straightforward and environmentally friendly approach for modification of heterocyclic compounds from readily accessible thioethers. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. Furthermore, successful synthesis on a 10-gram scale was achieved in a continuous flow electrochemical reactor.

AB Simple Summary Modern agricultural methods have led to the introduction of normally highland Tibetan pigs to lowland areas because of their high-quality meat. Similar to humans, indigenous Tibetan pigs residing in high-altitude regions may develop high-altitude de-acclimatization syndrome when exposed to low-altitude environments. Thus, it is important to better understand the low-altitude adaptation mechanisms of Tibetan pigs. We performed a comparative analysis between highland and lowland Tibetan pigs using genotyping data to investigate their genetic differences. Our results showed that immune-related genes were selected in highland Tibetan pigs, whereas genes associated with reproduction, growth and development, and blood pressure regulation were selected in lowland Tibetan pigs. These findings will contribute to research into the genetic basis of environmental adaptation and important economic traits in Tibetan pigs and provide genetic targets for breeding programs to improve Tibetan pigs.Abstract Tibetan pigs are indigenous to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and have been the subject of extensive genomic research primarily focused on their adaptation to high altitudes. However, genetic modifications associated with their response to low-altitude acclimation have not been thoroughly explored. To investigate the genetic basis underlying the low-altitude acclimation of Tibetan pigs, we generated and analyzed genotyping data of Tibetan pigs that inhabit high-altitude regions (average altitude 4000 m) and Tibetan pigs that have inhabited nearby low-altitude regions (average altitude 500 m) for approximately 20 generations. We found that the highland and lowland Tibetan pigs have distinguishable genotype and phenotype variations. We identified 46 and 126 potentially selected SNPs associated with 29 and 56 candidate genes in highland and lowland Tibetan pigs, respectively. Candidate genes in the highland Tibetan pigs were involved in immune response (NFYC and STAT1) and radiation (NABP1), whereas candidate genes in the lowland Tibetan pigs were related to reproduction (ESR2, DMRTA1, and ZNF366), growth and development (NTRK3, FGF18, and MAP1B), and blood pressure regulation (CARTPT). These findings will help to understand the mechanisms of environmental adaptation in Tibetan pigs and offer valuable information into the genetic improvement of Tibetan pigs pertaining to low-altitude acclimation and economic traits.

AB Tartary buckwheat green leaves are considered to be among the most important by-products in the buckwheat industry. Although Tartary buckwheat green leaves are abundant in pectic polysaccharides, their potential applications in the food industry are quite scarce. Therefore, to promote their potential applications as functional or fortified food ingredients, both deep-eutectic-solvent-assisted extraction (DESE) and high-pressure-assisted deep eutectic solvent extraction (HPDEE) were used to efficiently and selectively extract pectic polysaccharides from Tartary buckwheat green leaves (TBP). The results revealed that both the DESE and HPDEE techniques not only improved the extraction efficiency of TBP but also regulated its structural properties and beneficial effects. The primary chemical structures of TBP extracted using different methods were stable overall, mainly consisting of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) pectic regions. However, both the DESE and HPDEE methods could selectively extract RG-I-enriched TBP, and the proportion of the RG-I pectic region in TBP obviously improved. Additionally, both the DESE and HPDEE methods could improve the antioxidant and anti-glycosylation effects of TBP by increasing its proportion of free uronic acids and content of bound polyphenolics and reducing its molecular weight. Moreover, both the DESE and HPDEE methods could partially intensify the immunostimulatory effect of TBP by increasing its proportion of the RG-I pectic region. These findings suggest that DES-based extraction techniques, especially the HPDEE method, can be promising techniques for the efficient and selective extraction of RG-I-enriched TBP.

AB The direct discharge of industrial emulsified wastewater critically threatens the environment and human health. Emulsified wastewater must be demulsified before discharge. Inspired by the applications of microchannels in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion separation and patterned wettable surfaces to manipulate droplet formation, an arrow-shaped patterned microchannel (APM) was designed to enhance the droplet coalescence and demulsification of O/W emulsions with high oil content. The APM demulsification efficiency with 15 arrows of 5 patterns attained 70 % within 4.5 s when handling the O/W emulsion of 40 % (v/v) oil content. The experimental and simulation results revealed that the arrow-shaped patterns provided a series of inducing effects for dispersed droplets, enabling the coalesced droplets to form "oil-droplet-string flows". These positive inductions improved the efficiency of droplet coalescence and phase separation, thereby markedly enhancing the demulsification effect. By introducing the arrow-shaped wettable patterns, APM achieves the highest single demulsification efficiency of 70 % known at present for surfactant stabilized O/W emulsion with high oil content. This study provides a new technical approach for the treatment of industrial emulsified wastewater with high oil content.

   Toxicity
AB Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has been used in a variety of products due to its outstanding phase transition properties. However, as potential heavy metal contaminants, the environmental hazards and risks of VO2 should be systematically investigated. Biological nitrogen fixation is one of the most dominant processes in biogeochemical cycle, which is associated with nitrogen -fixing bacteria. In this study, we reported the environmental bio-effects of VO2 micro/nanoparticles on the nitrogen -fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. VO2 at 10 and 30 mg/L caused severe hazards to A. vinelandii, such as cell apoptosis, oxidative damage, physical damage, genotoxicity, and the loss of nitrogen fixation activity. The up -regulated differentially expressed genes of A. vinelandii were related to stress response, and the down -regulated genes were mainly related to energy metabolism. Surprisingly, VO2 of 10 mg/L decreased the nif gene expression but elevated the vnf gene expression, which enhanced the ability of A. vinelandii to reduce acetylene in anaerobic environment. In addition, under tested conditions, VO2 nanoparticles exhibited insignificantly higher toxicity than VO2 microparticles.

AB Endothelial cell (EC) barrier dysfunction and increased adhesion of immune inflammatory cells to ECs crucially contribute to acute lung injury (ALI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and exerts characteristic vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. SARS-COV2 infects the lungs by binding to ACE2, which can lead to dysregulation of ACE2 expression, further leading to ALI with predominantly vascular inflammation and eventually to more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, restoration of ACE2 expression represents a valuable therapeutic approach for SARSCOV-2-related ALI/ARDS. In this study, we used polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), a double -stranded RNA analog, to construct a mouse ALI model that mimics virus infection. After Poly(I:C) exposure, ACE2 was downregulated in mouse lung tissues and in cultured ECs. Treatment with DIZE, an ACE2-activating compound, upregulated ACE2 expression and relieved ALI in mice. DIZE also improved barrier function and reduced the number of THP-1 monocytes adhering to cultured ECs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated FAK (pFAK) levels were increased in lung tissues of ALI mice as well as in Poly(I:C)-treated ECs in vitro. Both DIZE and the FAK inhibitor PF562271 decreased FAK/p-FAK expression in both ALI models, attenuating ALI severity in vivo and increasing barrier function and reducing monocyte adhesion in cultured ECs. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using ANG 1-7 and the MAS inhibitor A779 corroborated that DIZE-mediated ACE2 activation stimulated the activity of the ANG 1-7/MAS axis, which inhibited FAK/p-FAK expression in the mouse lung. These findings provide further evidence that activation of ACE2 in ECs may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for ALI.

AB The cell walls of wheat endosperm, which play a pivotal role in seed germination, exhibit a laminated structure primarily composed of polysaccharides. In this study, composite multilayer films were prepared using arabinoxylan (AX), (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan (MLG), and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), and the effect of polymer blend structure on cell wall hydration and mechanical properties was investigated. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction indicated that the network structure of MLG/CNF exhibits a higher degree of continuity and uniformity compared to that of AX/CNF. Mechanically, the extensive linkages between MLG and CNFs chains enhance the mechanical properties of the films. Moreover, water diffusion experiments and TD-NMR analysis revealed that water molecules diffuse faster in the network structure formed by AX. We propose a structural model of the endosperm cell wall, in which the CNFs polymer blend coated with MLG serves as the framework, and the AX network fills the gaps between them, providing diffusion channels for water molecules.

AB This brief studies the stability issue of neural networks with respect to time -varying delay. First, an enhanced cubic functions negative -definiteness determination Lemma is proposed by using partitioning technique and Taylor's formula. Compared with the previous results, this Lemma can eliminate the conservatism of constraint conditions by interval -decomposition method. Second, for the sake of the relaxed positive -definiteness determination, an asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is presented. Third, a resulting time -varying delay -dependent stability criterion is derived by making use of some inequality techniques. Finally, the advantage of the new approach are verified theoretically and numerically.

AB Extreme drought is found to cause a threshold response in photosynthesis in ecosystem level. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood, highlighting the importance of revealing the drought thresholds for multiple leaf-level photosynthetic processes. Thus, we conducted a long-term experiment involving precipitation reduction and nitrogen (N) addition. Moreover, an extreme drought event occurred within the experimental period. We found the presence of drought thresholds for multiple leaf-level photosynthetic processes, with the leaf light-saturated carbon assimilation rate (Asat) displaying the highest threshold (10.76 v/v%) and the maximum rate of carboxylation by Rubisco (Vcmax) showing the lowest threshold (5.38 v/v%). Beyond the drought thresholds, the sensitivities of leaf-level photosynthetic processes to soil water content could be greater. Moreover, N addition lowered the drought thresholds of Asat and stomatal conductance (gs), but had no effect on that of Vcmax. Among species, plants with higher leaf K concentration traits had a lower drought threshold of Asat. Overall, this study highlights that leaf photosynthesis may be suppressed abruptly as soil water content surpasses the drought threshold. However, N enrichment helps to improve the resistance via delaying drought threshold response. These new findings have important implications for understanding the nonlinearity of ecosystem productivity response and early warning management in the scenario of combined extreme drought events and continuous N deposition.

AB Energy consumption and environmental pollution need us to explore new and sustainable energy sources. Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production offers one of the most effective solutions to this problem. Identifying an advanced photocatalyst is essential to achieve high-efficiency photocatalytic water splitting. We observed that the SnS/MoSi2N4 van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) is a viable candidate for photocatalytic water splitting using density functional theory (DFT). Our investigation has revealed that the SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH exhibits type-II band alignment, which is highly advantageous for spatially separating photoexcited electron-hole pairs. Remarkably, this type-II band arrangement remains stable across different stacking forms of the vdWH. Meanwhile, SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH exhibits high light absorption ability. After considering the Janus effect, we have ascertained that SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH likely possesses appropriate band edge positions for facilitating water splitting. Moreover, we revealed that bandgap and light absorption of SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH could be further improved by applying the strain while SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH still maintains the appropriate band edge positions. The results suggest that SnS/MoSi2N4 vdWH is an ideal photocatalyst for water splitting.

AB Intramuscular fat refers to the adipose tissue distributed in the muscle. It is an important indicator that affects the quality of goat meat, and can directly affect the tenderness and flavor of goat meat. Our previous study revealed the mRNA that may be crucial for intramuscular fat deposition during goat growth; however, how the microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the process is largely unclear. In the present study, a total of 401 known miRNAs and 120 goat novel miRNAs, including 110 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, were identified among longissimus dorsi from three growth stages (2, 9, and 24 months) by miRNA sequencing. Combining analysis of the DE mRNAs and DE miRNAs was then performed by miRDB and miRwalk, and miR-145-5p and FOXO1, miR-487b-3p, and PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A), miR-345-3p, and solute carrier family 2 member 4 (SLC2A4), etc. were shown to closely associate with lipid metabolism, which was then validated by a correlation analysis. The final DE mRNAs were significantly enriched in fatty acid transmembrane transport, fatty acid homeostasis, apelin signaling pathway, glucagon signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Besides, miR-145-5p showed a certain effect on goat intramuscular fat metabolism by acting on the possible target gene Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1). These data provide some theoretical support for improving the quality of goat meat.

AB Limited knowledge of bird microbiome in the all-body niche hinders our understanding of host-microbial relationships and animal health. Here, we characterized the microbial composition of the crested ibis from 13 body sites, representing the cloaca, oral, feather and skin habitats, and explored assembly mechanism structuring the bacterial community of the four habitats respectively. The bacterial community characteristics were distinct among the four habitats. The skin harboured the highest alpha diversity and most diverse functions, followed by feather, oral and cloaca. Individual-specific features were observed when the skin and feathers were concentrated independently. Skin and feather samples of multiple body sites from the same individual were more similar than those from different individuals. Although a significant proportion of the microbiota in the host (85.7%-96.5%) was not derived from the environmental microbiome, as body sites became more exposed to the environment, the relative importance of neutral processes (random drift or dispersal) increased. Neutral processes were the most important contributor in shaping the feather microbiome communities (R2 = .859). A higher percentage of taxa (29.3%) on the skin were selected by hosts compared to taxa on other body habitats. This study demonstrated that niche speciation and partial neutral processes, rather than environmental sources, contribute to microbiome variation in the crested ibis. These results enhance our knowledge of baseline microbial diversity in birds and will aid health management in crested ibises in the future.

AB Tibetan medicine Bang Jian refers to a range of botanical drugs within the Gentiana genus. It serves as a prominent traditional Tibetan botanical drug primarily found in the ethnic minority regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. Traditionally, the dried flowers of Bang Jian, known as "Longdanhua" have been employed in Tibetan medicine to address detoxification, pharyngeal relief, acute and chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung infections, pulmonary fibrosis, and throat disorders. Surprisingly, there has been no comprehensive review published to date on Tibetan medicine Bang Jian. This passage systematically presents and critically assesses recent advancements in botanical characterization, traditional applications, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical uses of Bang Jian, aiming to provide a scientific foundation for its reasonable use and further exploration. To date, researchers have isolated and identified 92 structurally diverse compounds, with a predominant presence of iridoids, flavonoids, xanthones, and triterpenoids. The crude extracts and metabolites derived from Bang Jian have been found to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological effects, encompassing anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, hepatoprotective properties, and protect the respiratory system. Nevertheless, detailed data on the biological effects, metabolic activities, and mechanistic research concerning active monomer metabolites remain insufficient. Consequently, there is a pressing need for comprehensive and in-depth research to guide rational clinical drug usage and evaluate the medicinal attributes of Bang Jian.

AB Originally used for additive manufacturing of polymer parts, the vat polymerization process was modified to fabricate ceramic parts by filling the resin with ceramic powder. In this study, we present the development of a ceramic slurry for additive manufacturing of ceramics via the vat polymerization process. With the shorter preparation time, the developed ceramic slurry containing 45 vol% solid loading exhibits considerable stability (minimal sedimentation observed over seven days) and low viscosity (<3 Pa s) that can be spread easily with a blade. We demonstrate the printability of the developed slurry by printing various geometries alumina and zirconia. The capability of the slurry was further extended to the printing of alumina platelets to mimic a natureinspired nacre-like structure. In conclusion, we demonstrated a way to quickly prepare UV-curable ceramic slurry and future work encompasses research on strengthening of the printed ceramics.

   wetting; Soil acidification; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau

AB Increases in temperature and precipitation have continually occurred in the past few decades, both globally and in China, which have probably impacted the dynamics of net methane (CH4) emissions by regulating soil CH4 oxidization. An alpine ecosystem is quite sensitive to climate changes, but how these two climatic factors regulate the community of soil aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (aMOB) remains elusive in such an ecosystem because of the lack of high-resolution soil sampling datasets. Here, we employed a hybrid approach of gridded field surveys and random forest prediction to discern the above question in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Results indicated that type Ic aMOBs exhibited a preference for drier, colder areas, while type IIa, TUSC-like and RA21-like aMOBs probably occurred in wetter and relatively warmer areas. There were no remarkable shifts in alpha-diversity and bacterial community compositions from the driest and coldest regions to moderate ones, while the alpha-diversity decreased and community compositions changed substantially from moderate arid and cold areas to wetter, relatively warmer ones. These trends were mainly regulated by soil pH, a potentially secondary effect shaped by the interactions of mean annual precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT) and an aridity index (AI) in the QTP. A slight decline in soil pH from the driest and coldest areas to moderate ones might regulate aMOB diversity and community structure by the stochastic extinction of individuals adapted to a higher pH and the unstable colonization of individuals preferring a moderate pH. A great decline in soil pH from the moderate arid, cold to wetter, relatively warmer areas might lead to the deterministic exclusion of species with a high pH adaptability and the stable colonization of species preferring the acidic habitat. This study implies that soil acidification probably induces aMOB diversity loss and species turnover in the arid, cold areas of the QTP under climatic warming and wetting, shedding a new light on projecting the impact of climate changes on an alpine ecosystem's structure and function on unprecedented spatial scales.

AB The development and application of lithium (Li) anode is hindered by volumetric variation, dendritic Li growth, and parasitic reactions. Herein, a dual-phase Li-barium (Ba) alloy with self-assembled microchannels array is synthesized through a one-step thermal fusion method to investigate the inhibition effect of lithiophilic composite porous array on Li dendrites. The Li-rich Li-Ba alloy (BaLi24) as composite Li electrode exhibits an ordered porous structure of BaLi4 intermetallic compound after delithiation, which acts as a built-in 3D current collector during Li plating/striping process. Furthermore, the lithiophilic BaLi4 alloy scaffold is a mixed conductor, featuring with Li+ ions diffusion capability, which can efficiently transport the reduced Li to the interior of the electrode structure. This unique top-down growth mode can effectively prohibit Li dendrites growth and improve the space utilization of 3D electrode structure. The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the absorption capability of BaLi4 benefits the deposition of Li metal. As a result, the cell performance with the dual-phase Li-Ba alloy anode is significantly improved.

AB A three-component Povarov reaction has been established to enantioselectively construct pyrroloquinolines in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid. This one-pot process affords the structurally important pyrroloquinolines exclusively as a single diastereomer in 53 to >99% yields with 55 to 99% ee. This catalytic protocol provides concise access to enantioenriched pyrroloquinolines, enabling the regiospecific construction of three types of annulated cycles in the carbocyclic ring of indole. This approach presents an alternative methodology for the straightforward functionalization of the carbocyclic ring of indoles.

AB BackgroundStudying the composition and developmental mechanisms in mammary gland is crucial for healthy growth of newborns. The mammary gland is inherently heterogeneous, and its physiological function dependents on the gene expression of multiple cell types. Most studies focused on epithelial cells, disregarding the role of neighboring adipocytes.ResultsHere, we constructed the largest transcriptomic dataset of porcine mammary gland cells thus far. The dataset captured 126,829 high-quality nuclei from physiological mammary glands across five developmental stages (d 90 of gestation, G90; d 0 after lactation, L0; d 20 after lactation, L20; 2 d post natural involution, PI2; 7 d post natural involution, PI7). Seven cell types were identified, including epithelial cells, adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts cells, immune cells, myoepithelial cells and precursor cells. Our data indicate that mammary glands at different developmental stages have distinct phenotypic and transcriptional signatures. During late gestation (G90), the differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes were inhibited. Meanwhile, partly epithelial cells were completely differentiated. Pseudo-time analysis showed that epithelial cells undergo three stages to achieve lactation, including cellular differentiation, hormone sensing, and metabolic activation. During lactation (L0 and L20), adipocytes area accounts for less than 0.5% of mammary glands. To maintain their own survival, the adipocyte exhibited a poorly differentiated state and a proliferative capacity. Epithelial cells initiate lactation upon hormonal stimulation. After fulfilling lactation mission, their undergo physiological death under high intensity lactation. Interestingly, the physiological dead cells seem to be actively cleared by immune cells via CCL21-ACKR4 pathway. This biological process may be an important mechanism for maintaining homeostasis of the mammary gland. During natural involution (PI2 and PI7), epithelial cell populations dedifferentiate into mesenchymal stem cells to maintain the lactation potential of mammary glands for the next lactation cycle.ConclusionThe molecular mechanisms of dedifferentiation, proliferation and redifferentiation of adipocytes and epithelial cells were revealed from late pregnancy to natural involution. This cell transcriptomic profile constitutes an essential reference for future studies in the development and remodeling of the mammary gland at different stages.

AB The construction energy consumption (EC) makes up around 35% of the total energy used. Half of this energy is used for air-conditioning to cool spaces. The effectiveness of cooling relates to various factors, particularly the dynamic thermal performance of air-conditioners (AC) in different conditions. Studying heat pumps in diverse hot and humid climates, especially where dehumidification matters in summer AC, reveals efficiency. Examining the connection between coefficient of performance (COP) and heat removal aids in lowering building energy usage and improving cooling systems. To achieve this, a validated thermodynamic model of heat pumps and a specific transient building heat transfer model were combined. The study focused on three distinct hot and humid climate zones: Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Jiuquan. Simulations of heat pump performance were conducted throughout the year to analyze variations in COP, relative humidity (RH), and latent heat load (LHL).Key findings indicate that the COP of heat pumps is notably influenced by the practical amount of dehumidification required. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.52151) exists between COP and LHL, emphasizing the importance of addressing dehumidification needs. The research highlights that the COP remains consistently high when the heat pump manages between 45% to 80% of the LHL. Practically, these findings have crucial implications for heat pump applications and building EC reduction, particularly in regions with pronounced dehumidification requirements during the cooling season. By understanding the interplay between heat pump efficiency, humidity, and heat load, practitioners can optimize heat pump performance to achieve energy savings. This research provides a valuable reference for designing and implementing cooling systems in various hot and humid climates, facilitating energy-efficient practices and environmentally friendly building operations.

AB Vaccines are widely used to prevent Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Under the pressure of immunization, NDVs with mutations among epitopes of F and HN protein were isolated, which indicates that the efficiency of vaccine may decrease in terms of preventing emerged NDV. However, the lack of evidences to support whether these mutations contribute to antigenic mutation and immune escape in NDV leading to the controversy that the matched vaccine is more effective than the mismatched vaccine. In this study, a genotype VII velogenic NDV strain (C22) was isolated from a vaccinated farm in Tibet, China. We found that this strain was close to NDV from east China, but it had a specific mutation (K138R) in one epitope (131DYIGGIGKE139) of HN protein. This mutation might change the interaction between amino acids in stalk-head link region of HN protein and then induce the specific antibody to worse recognize the C22 strain, but it did not alter viral virulence and growth ability. Then, the C22 strain was attenuated via modification of the F protein cleavage site to generate a matched vaccine. Comparing to a mismatched vaccine (LaSota), this matched vaccine showed advantages in inhibiting viral shedding and tissue damage. However, both vaccines induced chicken to generate similar level of neutralizing antibodies against C22, C22mut (R138K) and LaSota. These results suggest that the epitope mutation is insufficient to help NDV escaping neutralizing antibodies of vaccinated chicken, supporting that the merits of NDV matched vaccine are not totally related to humoral immunity.

AB Background It has been long thought that nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) concentrations and their ratios (N:P) in metabolically active or functional organs (i.e., leaves) are less responsive to environmental changes. Little attention, however, has been paid to the reproductive organs-seeds, while seeds may maintain their nutrients more stable for the evolutionary fitness of next generation.Methods Here, we conducted a field experiment of N, P addition and drought in an alpine meadow, aiming to compare the difference of leaf and seed nutrients and stoichiometric ratios in response to these resource treatments and their interactions. Four dominant species were selected among grass and forb functional groups, including Elymus nutans, Deschampsia caespitosa, Artemisia roxburghiana and Polygonum viviparum.Results Under natural conditions, leaf N and P concentrations were consistently lower than seed among species. However, leaf nutrients were much more sensitive than seed nutrients to N and P addition. Specifically, N or P addition accordingly increased leaf N or P concentration by 22.20-44.24% and 85.54-93.61%, while only enhanced seed N or P concentration by 5.15-17.20% and 15.17-32.72%, respectively. Leaf N or P concentration was significantly reduced by P or N addition, but seed nutrients remained unchanged. In contrast, drought did not change both organ nutrients. Similarly, nutrient addition and drought had synergistic interactions on leaf nutrients, but not on seed nutrients.Conclusions This study highlights that seed nutrient concentrations could be more stable than metabolically active leaf organ when facing multidimensional resource changes. This complements the traditional view on the 'Stable Leaf Nutrient Hypothesis' with the involvement of reproductive organs. The less responsiveness of seed nutrients suggests the adaptive strategy to ensure the success of next generations and long-term plant demographic stability.

AB Atherosclerosis is a dominant cause of cardiovascular disease. Accumulation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), formation of foam cells, and endothelial dysfunction within the arterial intima contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Soy consumption is thought to have positive effect on the prevention of atherosclerosis. Therefore, in the present study, a novel soybean polypeptide dglycin was purified and characterized. Oral administration of 20 mg/g.d dglycin reduced 47.6 % lesion area, and 49.1 % lipid deposition in the athero-sclerotic plaques in aortic roots in ApoE-/-mice. In addition, it decreased the levels of 26.0 % plasma low-density lipoprotein, 27.2 % triglyceride, 40.1 % cholesterol, 25.1 % malondialdehyde and 24.2 % tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF & alpha;). In vitro experiments revealed that dglycin inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretion from aortic endothelial cells via the inhibition of NF-& kappa;B signaling. Furthermore, it inhibited reactive oxygen species generation, subsequently enhanced cell viability, and protected aortic endothelial cells from necrosis and apoptosis via mitochondrial function improvement. On the other hand, dglycin prevented the uptake of oxidized LDL by macrophages via suppressing the expression of scavenger receptor class A1, which suggested that dglycin prevented foam cell formation. Therefore, dglycin alleviated the early-stage of atherosclerosis via depressing inflammation, lipid deposition, protecting aortic endothelial cells and preventing foam cell formation.

AB The rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2 or GI.2) is a highly contagious agent leading to lethal disease in rabbits. It frequently recombines with other Lagovirus genus, generating epidemical variants with high pathogenicity. In this study, twenty-two liver samples tested positive for GI.2 VP60 gene, were collected in rabbit farms from several geographical regions in China. All GI.2 positive specimens were submitted for RT-PCR detection, nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In addition, suspected GI.2 recombinants were evaluated for virus virulence. The results showed that nine presumptive recombinants were identified by testing for RdRp-VP60 recombination. In these recombinants, four were selected to fully characterize the genome of novel GI.2 recombinant variants, which were described as GI.1aP-GI.2. The nucleotide sequence of these novel variants showed unique recombination pattern and phylogenetic features compared to currently prevalent GI.2 variants. Furthermore, this distinctive recombination of new variant SCNJ-2021 moderately enhanced the virulence of GI.2, even for rabbits vaccinated against parental GI.2. In conclusion, the novel GI.1aP-GI.2 recombinants were identified in rabbit industry in China for the first time, which expanded the knowledge on the phylodynamics and genomic diversity of GI.2 genotype. The rapid molecular evolution and varied pathogenicity of these virus recombinants highlight the urgent need for epidemiological surveillance and for future prevention of these neglected GI.2 variants.

TI A polyoxometalate-based heterojunction nanozyme with peroxidase-mimic
   catalytic activity for sensitive biomolecule detection
SO NANOSCALE ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Nanozymes are a class of nanomaterials that can specifically mimic the structures and catalytic activities as well as overcome limitations of natural enzymes and have hence been considered as a competitive alternative to natural enzymes. At present, plenty of nanozymes, especially those with peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activity, have been extensively explored for biosensing. In this work, we proposed polyoxometalate-based heterojunction GdP5W30O110@WS2 nanoclusters (NCs) to exert intrinsic POD-like catalytic activity even under harsh catalytic conditions. Detailedly, GdP5W30O110@WS2 NCs possessing conducive POD-like catalytic activity can oxidize chromogenic substrates into colored substances in the presence of H2O2. On the strength of the POD-like catalytic activity of GdP5W30O110@WS2 NCs, a reliable analytical platform is then constructed after the optimization of catalytic conditions for the detection of H2O2, glutathione (GSH) and glucose via a simple TMB colorimetric strategy. This work advances the utilization of versatile polyoxometalate-based nanomaterials for biosensing, dramatically broadening the potential applications of other nanozyme-based biosensors.

AB BackgroundExploring the association of diet and indoor and outdoor environments on the gut microbiome of red-crowned cranes. We investigated the microbiome profile of the 24 fecal samples collected from nine cranes from day 1 to 35. Differences in the gut microbiome composition were compared across diet and environments.ResultsA total of 2,883 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, with 438 species-specific OTUs and 106 OTUs common to the gut microbiomes of four groups. The abundance of Dietzia and Clostridium XI increased significantly when the red-crowned cranes were initially fed live mealworms. Skermanella and Deinococcus increased after the red-crowned cranes were fed fruits and vegetables and placed outdoors. Thirty-three level II pathway categories were predicted. Our study revealed the mechanism by which the gut microbiota of red-crowned cranes responds to dietary and environmental changes, laying a foundation for future breeding, nutritional and physiological studies of this species.ConclusionsThe gut microbiome of red-crowned cranes could adapt to changes in diet and environment, but the proportion of live mealworms in captive red-crowned cranes can be appropriately reduced at the initial feeding stage, reducing the negative impact of high-protein and high-fat foods on the gut microbiome and growth and development.

AB Histone methylation plays an essential role in oocyte growth and preimplantation embryonic develop-ment. The modification relies on histone methyl-transferases and demethylases, and one of these, lysine -specific demethylase 2a (Kdm2a), is responsible for modulating histone methylation during oocyte and early embryonic development. The mechanism of how Kdm2a deficiency disrupts early embryonic development and fertility remains elusive. To determine if maternally deposited Kdm2a is required for preimplantation embryonic development, the expression profile of Kdm2a during early embryos was detected via immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR. The Kdm2a gene in oocytes was specifically deleted with the Zp3-Cre/LoxP system and the effects of maternal Kdm2a loss were studied through a comprehensive range of female reproductive parameters including fertilization, embryo development, and the number of births. RNA transcriptome sequencing was performed to determine differential mRNA expression, and the interaction between Kdm2a and the PI3K/Akt pathway was studied with a specific inhibitor and activator. Our results revealed that Kdm2a was continuously expressed in preimplantation embryos and loss of maternal Kdm2a suppressed the morula-to-blastocyst transition, which may have been responsible for female subfertility. After the deletion of Kdm2a, the global H3K36me2 methylation in mutant embryos was markedly increased, but the expression of E-cadherin decreased significantly in morula embryos compared to controls. Mechanistically, RNA-seq analysis revealed that deficiency of maternal Kdm2a altered the mRNA expression profile, especially in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Interestingly, the addition of a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (LY294002) to the culture medium blocked embryo development at the stage of morula; however, the developmental block caused by maternal Kdm2a loss was partially rescued with a PI3K/Akt activator (SC79). In summary, our results indicate that loss of Kdm2a influences the transcriptome profile and disrupts the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during the development of preimplantation embryo. This can result in embryo block at the morula stage and female subfertility, which suggests that maternal Kdm2a is a potential partial redundancy with other genes encoding enzymes in the dynamics of early embryonic development. Our results provide further insight into the role of histone modification, especially on Kdm2a, in preimplantation embryonic development in mice. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzo[d]thiazoles has been developed by nickel catalyzed cross-coupling of 2-methylthiobenzo[d]thiazoles with aryl and alkenylaluminum reagents. Various 2-(hetero)aryl and 2-alkenyl substituted benzo[d]thiazoles derivatives can be obtained with 31-94% isolated yields using 4 mol% NiCl2(dppf)/4 mol% 2,2 & PRIME;-bipyridine as the catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The coupling reaction can be carried out smoothly whether the electron donor group or electron withdrawing group is on the aromatic ring of organic aluminum reagents or 2-methylthiobenzo[d]thiazoles derivatives. Furthermore, the broad substrate scope and the typical maintenance of vigorous efficiency on a gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize 2-substituted benzo[d]thiazoles derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

AB Intramuscular lipid deposition is important for meat quality improvement. microRNAs and their target mRNAs provide a new approach for studying the mechanism of fat deposition. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-130b duplex (miR-130b-5p, miR-130b-3p) and its target gene KLF3 in regulating goat intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. Goat intramuscular preadipocytes were isolated from 7-d-old male Jianzhou big-ear goats and identified by Oil red O staining after differentiation induction. miR-130b-5p and miR-130b-3p mimics or inhibitors and their corresponding controls were transfected into goat intramuscular preadipocytes, respectively, and differentiation was induced by 50 & mu;M oleic acid for 48 h. Oil red O and Bodipy staining indicated that both miR-130b-5p and miR-130b-3p can reduce lipid droplets accumulation and triglyceride (TG) content (P < 0.01). Differentiation markers C/EBP & alpha;, C/EBP & beta;, PPAR & gamma;, pref1, fatty acids synthesis markers ACC, FASN, DGAT1, DGAT2, AGPAT6, TIP47, GPAM, ADRP, AP2, SREBP1, and TG markers LPL, ATGL, HSL were assessed by qPCR. All the markers measured were downregulated by miR-130b-5p and miR-130b-3p analog (P < 0.01), suggesting that miR-130b inhibits goat intramuscular adipocyte adipogenic differentiation, fatty acids synthesis, and lipid lipolysis. To examine the mechanism of miR-130b duplex inhibition of lipid deposition, TargetScan, miRDB, and starBase were used to predict the potential targets, KLF3 was found to be the only one intersection. Furthermore, the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEUTR of KLF3 was cloned, qPCR analysis and dual luciferase activity assay showed that both miR-130b-5p and miR-130b-3p could directly regulate KLF3 expression (P < 0.01). In addition, overexpression and interference of KLF3 were conducted, it was found that KLF3 positively regulated lipid droplets accumulation by Oil red O, Bodipy staining, and TG content detection (P < 0.01). Quantitative PCR result indicated that KLF3 overexpression promoted lipid droplets accumulation relative genes C/EBP & beta;, PPAR & gamma;, pref1, ACC, FASN, DGAT1, DGAT2, AGPAT6, TIP47, GPAM, ADRP, SREBP1, LPL, and ATGL expression (P < 0.01). Downregulation of KLF3 inhibited the expression of genes such as C/EBP & alpha;, C/EBP & beta;, PPAR & gamma;, pref1, TIP47, GPAM, ADRP, AP2, LPL, and ATGL expression (P < 0.01). Taken together, these results indicate that miR-130b duplex could directly inhibit KLF3 expression, then attenuated adipogenic and TG synthesis genes expression, thus leading to its anti-adipogenic effect.
   Results in the present study demonstrate that the miR-130b duplex (miR-130b-3p/miR-130b-5p) expression changed after goat adipocyte differentiation and negatively regulate goat intramuscular preadipocyte lipid droplets accumulation by targeting KLF3 expression.
   Lay Summary microRNAs (miRNAs) are small (19 to 24 nucleotides), single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that are evolutionarily conserved and can be complimentary bound to the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME-untranslated region (3MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEUTR) of their target mRNA for cleavage or translation inhibition to participate in almost all biological processes. We demonstrated miR-130b duplex (miR-130b-3p/miR-130b-5p) negatively regulates goat intramuscular preadipocyte lipid droplets accumulation by targeting Kruppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) expression. This research opens new visions to study and understand the functions and mechanisms of goat miRNAs in lipid deposition.

AB Positive relationships between tree species diversity and soil communities are reported in many studies. However, the effects of tree species richness and nitrogen (N)-fixing tree species on soil fauna communities are not yet fully understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to investigate changes in soil nematode communities under a gradient of tree species richness (e.g., 1, 2, 4 and 6 tree species) with N-fixing tree species (absence or presence). We found that N-fixing tree species strongly affected soil nematode trophic groups, and significantly increased the abundance of omnivore-predators and structure index via promoting more trophic links and multitrophic interactions, leading to a more stable and complex soil food web. In the presence of N-fixing tree species, tree species richness significantly increased the abundance and relative abundance of fungivores and the channel index, with the shift in soil energy channel through increased the C/N ratio of leaf litter. In contrast, tree species richness detrimentally affected the abundance of plant parasites due to the decline of leaf litter N content under the presence of N-fixing tree species. The results revealed that the bottom-up effects of N-fixing tree species on soil nematode community structure were crucial drivers in shaping nematode communities in subtropical plantations. Our study suggests that N-fixing tree species is more important than tree species richness to regulate soil nematode community structure and soil energy channel, and therefore, should be preferentially considered in multispecies forest plantations.

AB 1. Surging demand for medicinal plant products may lead to unsustainable harvesting practices, which could put pressure on wild populations. Yet little is known about indigenous harvesters' preferences on key traditional Chinese medicinal plant resources, and how these might affect sustainable use and management.
   2. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with over 900 native Tibetan harvesters in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in China, under a range of complex alternative livelihood, climate and environmental change, and land tenure and customs scenarios.
   3. We used random parameter logit model with broad heterogeneity to estimate local Tibetan harvesters' preferences and their willingness to harvest, and latent class logit model to explore distinct within-population groupings based on shared preferences, for designing possible interventions.
   4. We uncovered three key findings with important management implications for medicinal plants. When given a choice, the local harvesters preferred not to harvest any herbs. However, if they opted to harvest, they preferred to harvest flowers and seeds, as compared to roots, and tended to use wooden tool (over the use of bare hands and iron tool).
   5. Notably, the degree of compliance with village rules and customs, and ecological worldview interact with targeted plant parts and potential income from harvest to influence their harvesting preferences. Their choices were sensitive to scenario-based changes to livelihood options.
   6. Finally, our study revealed three distinct harvester groups with substantial heterogeneity. Specifically, two groups consisted of over 60% of the interviewed harvesters who appeared to have a strong preference for sustainable practices, while the remaining group lacks this tendency.
   7. Overall, our results shed light on the importance of understanding the drivers of harvesting preferences and the heterogeneity of harvesting practices among indigenous people and their cultural and sustainability leanings, providing crucial insights for future sustainable use and management of wild and economically important medicinal plants in the grasslands of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other regions.

AB Root traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are important in determining the access of plants to soil resources. However, whether plants with different root systems (i.e., taproot vs. fibrous-root) exhibit different root trait plasticity and mycorrhizal responsiveness under drought remains largely unexplored. Tap-rooted Lespedeza davurica and fibrous-rooted Stipa bungeana were grown in monocultures in sterilized and live soils, followed by a drought treatment. Biomass, root traits, root colonization by AM fungi, and nutrient availability were evaluated. Drought decreased biomass and root diameter but increased the root:shoot ratio (RSR), specific root length (SRL), soil NO3--N, and available P for the two species. Under control and drought conditions, soil sterilization significantly increased the RSR, SRL, and soil NO3--N for L. davurica, but this only occurs under drought condition for S. bungeana. Soil sterilization significantly reduced AM fungal root colonization of both species, but drought significantly increased it in live soil. In water-abundant conditions, tap-rooted L. davurica may depend more on AM fungi than fibrous-rooted S. bungeana; however, under drought conditions, AM fungi are of equal importance in favoring both plant species to forage soil resources. These findings provide new insights for understanding the resource utilization strategies under climate change.

AB Litter leachates have the potential to considerably regulate biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet the effects of litter leachates on the soil microbial composition have so far not been adequately evaluated. Litter leachates of Elymus nutans, Kobresia setchwanensis, Ligularia virgaurea, were sprayed onto alpine meadow to assess their effects on community structure. Specific functional genes of soil bacteria were also analyzed to explore their potential ecological functions. Results indicate that application of litter leachates to alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau over three consecutive growing seasons, modifies plant communities and soil bacterial composition. Plant biomass, soil moisture, and C:N ratio of litter leachate treated soils were lower compared to the control, but soil microbial biomass carbon was greater. Increased plant and soil bacterial & alpha;-diversities were accompanied by alterations in soil physico-chemical properties and plant community structures, including higher soil bacterial & beta;-diversity. Soil moisture, organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, inorganic nitrogen, and C:N ratio being abiotic factors, were closely related to bacterial composition in the topsoil (0-20 cm), while plant biomass and diversity were the major biotic driving forces of soil bacterial composition in both topsoil and subsoil (20-40 cm). L. virgaurea litter leachate application increased soil nitrogen fixation potential, E. nutans and K. setchwanensis litter leachates reduced soil nitrification and denitrification however. These results indicate that litter leachates stimulate the nitrogen cycle in alpine meadow by altering bacterial composition and function of plants and soil bacteria. This ecologically significant contribution supports strategic application of litter leachates on alpine pasture.

AB To investigate the relationship among post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic growth (PTG), social support, and coping style of university student volunteers in the prevention and control of the coronavirus in 2020, a total of 2,990 university student volunteers (students who are enrolled in a university and involved in volunteer activities) from 20 universities in Sichuan Province participated in the prevention and control of the epidemic were investigated when March 20-31, 2020 when the coronavirus first occurred using the post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire, posttraumatic growth questionnaire, university student social support questionnaire and coping style questionnaire. The results showed that (1) 7.06% of university student volunteers had some degree of PTSD symptoms (the total PCL-C score was 38-49), and 2.88% had obvious PTSD symptoms, (2) PTSD level of university student volunteers was significantly positively correlated with negative coping style, and significantly negatively correlated with social support and positive coping style; on the contrary, the PTG level is significantly positively correlated with social support and positive coping styles, and (3) Positive coping style plays a partial mediating role in the influence of social support on PTG; in the influence of social support on PTSD, the mediating effect of positive or negative coping style was not significant. These results show that in the prevention and control of the coronavirus, the positive coping style and social support of university student volunteers can positively predict the PTG level of them, while the negative coping style can positively predict the severity of their PTSD symptoms. Among them, a positive coping style plays a partial mediating role in the influence of social support on the PTG level.

AB From a configurational perspective, this study aims to explain how clusters drive firm performance in the regional innovation system by considering the relationship between cluster and firm performance as causal complexity. Using an original dataset comprising 292 Chinese firms in strategic emerging industries (SEIs), this study employs a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate the conjunction effects of interorganizational dependence, network embeddedness, and ambidextrous innovation on cluster firms' performance. The results showed that the fsQCA method uncovers causal combinations of these cluster factors that lead to high performance. These configurations imply two alternative pathways to enhance performance, where exploitative innovation is identified as the core causal condition.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB CD-205 receptor-mediated dendritic cell (DC) targeting liposomes are commonly used as a delivery system for inducing a strong T-cell immune response or specific immune tolerance. This delivery system can carry both the antigen and adjuvant, thereby modulating DC maturation and also activating the T-cell response. In order to maximize the desired therapeutic effects of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) and induce an efficient cellular and humoral immune response against the antigen, ovalbumin (OVA) and APS were encapsulated in long-circling liposomes conjugated with anti-CD-205 receptor antibodies to produce CD-205-targeted liposomes (iLPSM). We explored using a series of experiments evaluating the targeting efficiency of iLPSM. In vitro, iLPSM nanoparticles promoted the proliferation of macrophages, and the nanoparticles were rapidly phagocytized by macrophages. In vivo, iLPSM significantly improved the antibody titers of OVA-specific IgG and IgG, isotypes cytokine production, and T and B lymphocyte differentiation. Furthermore, iLPSM facilitated the maturation of DCs. In addition, iLPSM nanoparticles could prolong the retention time of nanoparticles at the injection site, leading to a strong, sustained immune response. These results show that the CD-205 antibody successfully binds to the corresponding cell receptor.

AB Space heating accounts for a large part of building energy consumption. Lowering the heating temperature set-point (Tsp) is expected to be a feasible approach for energy efficiency. In this paper, eight globally typical cities are selected, and the energy-saving mechanism and variation trends of lowering heating Tsp are investigated under different working conditions (climate conditions, construction completion year and inner heat sources). The results show that significant energy-saving effects even appear in the relatively warm-winter cities. The energy-saving mechanism is dominated by two different categories of heating hours including the temperature-difference saving (TDS) hours and the behavioral saving (BS) hours. The contribution of TDS and BS to the whole annual heating energy saving amount (HSA) depends on the reducing level of heating hours. The HSA of lowing Tsp is mainly affected by TDS influence. After coupling the consideration of different factors, with the decreasing annual HSA of buildings, the dominance of the TDS influence mechanism shrinks gradually while the annual heating energy saving ratio (HSR) increases. This work provides the analysis method for building heating energy saving potential evaluation and reference for the establishment of standards and residents' behavioral energy saving in different climatic zones.

AB Developing multifunctional materials for 2-naphthol (2-NAP) monitoring is in urgent demand since 2-NAP not only brings us convenience but also causes serious environmental and health issues. Herein, we report a novel beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based molecular-responsive photonic hydrogel chemosensor composed of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-maleic anhydride-beta-cyclodextrin) (PNACD) hydrogel with embedded superparamagnetic Fe3O4 colloidal particle chains, for highly sensitive and visual detection of 2-NAP in aqueous solution. The Fe3O4 particle chains in the polymer matrix could strongly diffract visible light and transmit a 2-NAP concentration signal to the color change of the gel by changing the gel volume and lattice spacing of Fe3O4 particles. The rich beta-CD groups attached to the polymer networks could specifically recognize and bind to 2-NAP by forming stable beta-CD/2-NAP inclusion complexes. This specific molecular recognition expanded the gel, increased the particle spacing, and thus redshifted the reflection wavelengths of the gel and indicated the color changes of the gel. This photonic hydrogel exhibited remarkable thermo- and pH-dependent responsiveness to 2-NAP, a wider linear detection range of 0.01-500 mu M and a comparatively lower detection concentration of 0.01 mu M compared with the conventional instrument-based methods. Besides, it also demonstrated excellent regenerability and was applicable to monitor 2-NAP in a simulated contaminated river water sample. Such a multifunctional hydrogel with high sensitivity and selectivity toward 2-NAP as well as excellent recyclability holds great potential in sensitive, precise and naked-eye detection of aromatic pollutants in contaminated water bodies.

AB BackgroundSharply increased beef consumption is propelling the genetic improvement projects of beef cattle in China. Three-dimensional genome structure is confirmed to be an important layer of transcription regulation. Although genome-wide interaction data of several livestock species have already been produced, the genome structure states and its regulatory rules in cattle muscle are still limited.ResultsHere we present the first 3D genome data in Longissimus dorsi muscle of fetal and adult cattle (Bos taurus). We showed that compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and loop undergo re-organization and the structure dynamics were consistent with transcriptomic divergence during muscle development. Furthermore, we annotated cis-regulatory elements in cattle genome during myogenesis and demonstrated the enrichments of promoter and enhancer in selection sweeps. We further validated the regulatory function of one HMGA2 intronic enhancer near a strong sweep region on primary bovine myoblast proliferation.ConclusionsOur data provide key insights of the regulatory function of high order chromatin structure and cattle myogenic biology, which will benefit the progress of genetic improvement of beef cattle.

AB Semantic segmentation is a growing topic in high-resolution remote sensing image processing. The information in remote sensing images is complex, and the effectiveness of most remote sensing image semantic segmentation methods depends on the number of labels; however, labeling images requires significant time and labor costs. To solve these problems, we propose a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method based on dual cross-entropy consistency and a teacher-student structure. First, we add a channel attention mechanism to the encoding network of the teacher model to reduce the predictive entropy of the pseudo label. Secondly, the two student networks share a common coding network to ensure consistent input information entropy, and a sharpening function is used to reduce the information entropy of unsupervised predictions for both student networks. Finally, we complete the alternate training of the models via two entropy-consistent tasks: (1) semi-supervising student prediction results via pseudo-labels generated from the teacher model, (2) cross-supervision between student models. Experimental results on publicly available datasets indicate that the suggested model can fully understand the hidden information in unlabeled images and reduce the information entropy in prediction, as well as reduce the number of required labeled images with guaranteed accuracy. This allows the new method to outperform the related semi-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm at half the proportion of labeled images.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most contagious livestock diseases in the world, posing a constant global threat to the animal trade and national economies. The chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), a biomarker for predicting disease progression in some diseases, was recently found to be increased in sera from mice infected with FMD virus (FMDV) and to be associated with the progression and severity of the disease. However, it has not yet been determined which cells are involved in producing CXCL13 and the signaling pathways controlling CXCL13 expression in these cells. In this study, the expression of CXCL13 was found in macrophages and T cells from mice infected with FMDV, and CXCL13 was produced in bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by activating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) and JAK/STAT pathways following FMDV infection. Interestingly, CXCL13 concentration was decreased in sera from interleukin-10 knock out (IL-10(-/-)) mice or mice blocked IL-10/IL-10R signaling in vivo after FMDV infection. Furthermore, CXCL13 was also decreased in IL-10(-/-) BMDMs and BMDMs treated with anti-IL-10R antibody following FMDV infection in vitro. Lastly, it was demonstrated that IL-10 regulated CXCL13 expression via JAK/STAT rather than the NF-kappa B pathway. In conclusion, the study demonstrated for the first time that macrophages and T cells were the cellular sources of CXCL13 in mice infected with FMDV; CXCL13 was produced in BMDMs via NF-kappa B and JAK/STAT pathways; and IL-10 promoted CXCL13 expression in BMDMs via the JAK/STAT pathway.

AB RF amide-related peptide 3 (RFRP-3), a mammalian ortholog of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH), is identified to be a novel inhibitory endogenous neurohormonal peptide that regulates mammalian reproduction by binding with specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) in various species. Herein, our objectives were to explore the biological functions of exogenous RFRP-3 on the apoptosis and steroidogenesis of yak cumulus cells (CCs) and the developmental potential of yak oocytes. The spatiotemporal expression pattern and localization of GnIH/RFRP-3 and its receptor GPR147 were determined in follicles and CCs. The effects of RFRP-3 on the proliferation and apoptosis of yak CCs were initially estimated by EdU assay and TUNEL staining. We confirmed that high-dose (10(-6) mol/L) RFRP-3 suppressed viability and increased the apoptotic rates, implying that RFRP-3 could repress proliferation and induce apoptosis. Subsequently, the concentrations of E-2 and P-4 were significantly lower with 10(-6) mol/L RFRP-3 treatment than that of the control counterparts, which indicated that the steroidogenesis of CCs was impaired after RFRP-3 treatment. Compared with the control group, 10(-6) mol/L RFRP-3 treatment decreased the maturation of yak oocytes efficiently and subsequent developmental potential. We sought to explore the potential mechanism of RFRP-3-induced apoptosis and steroidogenesis, so we observed the levels of apoptotic regulatory factors and hormone synthesis-related factors in yak CCs after RFRP-3 treatment. Our results indicated that RFRP-3 dose-dependently elevated the expression of apoptosis markers (Caspase and Bax), whereas the expression levels of steroidogenesis-related factors (LHR, StAR, 3 beta-HSD) were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. However, all these effects were moderated by cotreatment with inhibitory RF9 of GPR147. These results demonstrated that RFRP-3 adjusted the expression of apoptotic and steroidogenic regulatory factors to induce apoptosis of CCs, probably through binding with its receptor GPR147, as well as compromised oocyte maturation and developmental potential. This research revealed the expression profiles of GnIH/RFRP-3 and GPR147 in yak CCs and supported a conserved inhibitory action on oocyte developmental competence.

AB Small businesses with many stocking locations face high ordering costs and imbalanced inventories. To address those challenges, we consider an inventory system of multiple retailers: each has Poisson demand and backorders are permitted. They order together periodically and there is an opportunity to transship available inventory between retailers in each order cycle. Each order incurs a fixed cost, and there is a variable transshipping cost, a holding cost for inventory, and a penalty cost for backorders. The system aims to determine a feasible ordering and transshipping plan which minimizes the long-run average total cost over time. We provide an analytical approach to evaluating costs, construct bounds to search for the optimal order interval, order-up-to level, and timing of transshipment, and determine the amounts to transship based on a marginal cost. Our numerical studies find that, first, the optimal order interval is between that in the no-transshipment case and an EOQ-like calculation. Second, the optimal timing of transshipments is in the middle of an order cycle or a little later. Third, the optimal order interval and timing of transshipments are insensitive to the introduction of differences between retailers. Fourth, transshipment effectively reduces costs, especially when transshipment costs are low or different between retailers. These findings can simplify the task of cost optimization in complex inventory systems and develop practical measures to further reduce costs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objectives of this study were to explore the possibility of using near infrared (NIR) and Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (ATR-FT/MIR) molecular spectroscopic techniques as non-invasive and rapid methods for the quantification of six major ergot alkaloids (EAs) in cool-season wheat. In total, 107 wheat grain samples were collected, and the concentration of six major EAs was analyzed using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technique. The mean content of the total EAs-ergotamine, ergosine, ergometrine, ergocryptine, ergocristine, and ergocornine-was 1099.3, 337.5, 56.9, 150.6, 142.1, 743.3, and 97.45 mu g/kg, respectively. The NIR spectra were taken from 680 to 2500 nm, and the MIR spectra were recorded from 4000-700 cm(-1). The spectral data were transformed by various preprocessing techniques (which included: FD: first derivative; SNV: standard normal variate; FD-SNV: first derivative + SNV; MSC: multiplicative scattering correction; SNV-Detrending: SNV + detrending; SD-SNV: second derivative + SNV; SNV-SD: SNV + first derivative); and sensitive wavelengths were selected. The partial least squares (PLS) regression models were developed for EA validation statistics. Results showed that the constructed models obtained weak calibration and cross-validation parameters, and none of the models was able to accurately predict external samples. The relatively low levels of EAs in the contaminated wheat samples might be lower than the detection limits of the NIR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopies. More research is needed to determine the limitations of the ATR-FT/MIR and NIR techniques for quantifying EAs in various sample matrices and to develop acceptable models.

AB BackgroundTripsacum dactyloides (2n = 4x = 72) and Zea perennis (2n = 4x = 40) are tertiary gene pools of Zea mays L. and exhibit many abiotic adaptations absent in modern maize, especially salt tolerance. A previously reported allopolyploid (hereafter referred to as MTP, 2n = 74) synthesized using Zea mays, Tripsacum dactyloides, and Zea perennis has even stronger salt tolerance than Z. perennis and T. dactyloides. This allopolyploid will be a powerful genetic bridge for the genetic improvement of maize. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its salt tolerance, as well as the key genes involved in regulating its salt tolerance, remain unclear.ResultsSingle-molecule real-time sequencing and RNA sequencing were used to identify the genes involved in salt tolerance and reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Based on the SMRT-seq results, we obtained 227,375 reference unigenes with an average length of 2300 bp; most of the unigenes were annotated to Z. mays sequences (76.5%) in the NR database. Moreover, a total of 484 and 1053 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves and roots, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that multiple pathways responded to salt stress, including "Flavonoid biosynthesis," "Oxidoreductase activity," and "Plant hormone signal transduction" in the leaves and roots, and "Iron ion binding," "Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity," and "Serine-type carboxypeptidase activity" in the roots. Transcription factors, such as those in the WRKY, B3-ARF, and bHLH families, and cytokinin negatively regulators negatively regulated the salt stress response. According to the results of the short time series-expression miner analysis, proteins involved in "Spliceosome" and "MAPK signal pathway" dynamically responded to salt stress as salinity changed. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that heat shock proteins play a role in the large interaction network regulating salt tolerance.ConclusionsOur results reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of MTP in the response to salt stress and abundant salt-tolerance-related unigenes. These findings will aid the retrieval of lost alleles in modern maize and provide a new approach for using T. dactyloides and Z. perennis to improve maize.

TI Towards more sustainable diets: Insights from food production responses

ID MEAT CONSUMPTION
AB Similar to most middle-income countries, residents' dietary patterns are continuously changing in China. However, their future development directions (for instance, to a more sustainable diet) and impacts on national food production systems remain uncertain. This study links a diets driver module to a dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE) framework to identify potential diet changes and the consequent food production responses. The results show that China would shift its dietary structure towards a high consumption of vegetables, fruits and animal-source foods in 'conventional paths', which are a continuation of previous variation trends. This is likely to induce a rapid expansion in the yields of major foods during the period from 2018 to 2030, following which this increase would slow down. However, there would be a considerable decrease in staple foods, meat and egg intakes, as well as a sharp increase in dairy demand when diets shift towards the targets put forth in the Chinese Dietary Guideline. Under this shock, most food production activities would decrease in scale and the 'cereal-pork' agricultural priority would be diminished. These findings also stress the importance of synergy between the two endpoints of the food system and potential challenges facing the shift to sustainable diets.

AB Compared with the ideal point scattering model, the attributed scattering center (ASC) model provides concise and physically relevant description of the man-made targets, such as the vehicles and ships, giving an efficient way to interpret the measurements of high-frequency and wide-angle synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Since the ASC model is complicated, it gives rise to a high-dimensional model parameter estimation problem, leading to a heavy computational burden. Aimed at this problem, in this article, a novel superresolution composite SAR imaging algorithm is proposed based on sparse representation, in which the ASC attributes are estimated by a hierarchical pattern for reducing the computational cost. In the proposed algorithm, the ASC model parameters, classified into three categories, are estimated coarsely via minimum variance pursuit (MVP). Then these coarse estimates are refined jointly using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) optimization for polarimetric measurements. The spectrum extrapolation and replacement are performed for superresolution and reducing the impact of model mismatch, followed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based operation to efficiently obtain the final superresolution image. The proposed approach not only possesses the ability of superresolution reconstruction with the target nonideal scattering features' enhancement but also offers the physically relevant attributes on the premise of estimation accuracy improvement and calculation capacity reduction. Extensive experiments are conducted to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Simple Summary The TSSK1B gene has been demonstrated to play pivotal roles during spermatogenesis and is associated with male fertility. However, the potential mechanism on whether and how TSSK1B disrupts the fertility of yaks remains unknown. In this study, TSSK1B was found to be specifically expressed in the testes of yaks and especially highly expressed in adults. In contrast, it was rarely expressed in the testes of male cattle-yak, the hybrid F1 generation of the yak. The promoter region of TSSK1B in the adult cattle-yak testis was hypermethylated compared with that in the yak, which may be related to male cattle-yak infertility. This study provides the basis for further study of yak reproduction and male cattle-yak sterility. This study aimed to investigate the spatially and temporally expressed patterns and biological characteristics of TSSK1B in male yaks and explore the potential correlation between TSSK1B and male sterility of the yak hybrid offspring (termed cattle-yak). First, the coding sequence (CDS) of TSSK1B was cloned by RT-PCR, and bioinformatics analysis was conducted with relevant software. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to detect the expression profile of TSSK1B in various tissues of male adult yaks, the spatiotemporal expression of TSSK1B in different stages of yak testes, and the differential expression of TSSK1B between yak and cattle-yak testes. The cellular localization of TSSK1B was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the methylation status of the TSSK1B promoter region was analyzed by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). The results showed that TSSK1B was 1235 bp long, including 1104 bp of the CDS region, which encoded 367 amino acids. It was a conserved gene sharing the highest homology with Bos mutus (99.67%). In addition, the bioinformatics analysis revealed that TSSK1B was an unstable hydrophilic protein mainly containing the alpha helix of 34.06% and a random coil of 44.41%, with a transmembrane structure of 29 amino acids long. The RT-qPCR results demonstrated that TSSK1B was specifically expressed in yak testes compared with that in other tissues and especially highly expressed in adult yak testes. On the contrary, TSSK1B was hardly expressed in the testis of adult cattle-yak. IHC confirmed that TSSK1B protein was more strongly expressed in the testes of adult yaks than in their fetal and juvenile counterparts. Interestingly, nearly no expression was observed in the testes of cattle-yak compared with the corresponding testes of yak. Bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) revealed that the methylated CpG sites in the TSSK1B promoter region of cattle-yak was significantly higher than that in the yak. Taken together, this study revealed that TSSK1B was specifically expressed in yak testes and highly expressed upon sexual maturity. Moreover, the rare expression in cattle-yak may be related to the hypermethylation of the promoter region, thereby providing a basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanism of TSSK1B in male cattle-yak sterility.

AB Context The alkaloids of Narcissus tazetta L. var. Chinensis Roem (Amaryllidaceae) have antitumor and antiviral activities. However, the immunopharmacological effects of one of its constituents, pseudolycorine chloride (PLY), have not been reported yet. Objective We evaluated the effect of PLY on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) expansion and differentiation into monocyte-like MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and examined whether PLY alleviates Th17 cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and methods In vitro, MDSCs were treated with PLY (0.67, 2 and 6 mu M) or solcitinib (10 mu M, positive control) for 48 or 96 h, and their proliferation, expansion, and differentiation into M-MDSCs were examined by flow cytometry. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) was used to induce EAE in female C57BL/6 mice, and the mice were treated with 40 mg/kg/d PLY or 1 mg/kg/d FK-506 (tacrolimus, positive control) for 21 days. Inflammatory infiltration, spinal cord demyelination, and MDSCs and Th17 cells infiltration into the spinal cord were examined using haematoxylin and eosin staining, Luxol fast blue staining, and immunofluorescence, respectively. Results In vitro, PLY (IC50/24 h = 6.18 mu M) significantly inhibited IL-6 and GM-CSF-induced MDSCs proliferation, expansion and differentiation into M-MDSCs at all concentrations used. However, these concentrations did not show cytotoxicity. In mice, PLY (40 mg/kg) treatment alleviated EAE and inhibited inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and MDSCs and Th17 cells infiltration into the spinal cord. Discussion and conclusions PLY may be an excellent candidate for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune diseases.

AB Wilted (around 35% DM) or un-wilted (around 35% DM) Italian ryegrass treated with three additives (formic acid, FA; Lactobacillus plantarum, LP; Lactobacillus buchneri, LB) was utilized to evaluate the effects of the dry matter (DM) contents on the microbial community and fermentation characteristics, which was ensiled for 60 days in a laboratory-scale silo, followed by 3 days of aerobic exposure. Significantly lower pH and higher lactic acid (LA) contents were observed in the LP-treated group ensiled at both DM contents (differences were significant when p < 0.05). The contents of LA, acetic acid (AA), numbers of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in the FA-treated group were significantly lower than those in other treatments (p < 0.05). L. buchneri was the dominant bacteria after 60 days fermentation, while Enterobacteria became prevalent after 3 days of aerobic exposure. L. buchneri was found in the LB-treated group with higher acetic acid. Although the best fermentation quality was observed in the LP-treated silages, the aerobic stability was lowest compared to other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the DM content of Italian ryegrass affected its epiphytic microbial community and the effectiveness of the different type of additives. Formic acid was more suitable for un-wilted Italian ryegrass silage, L. plantarum had a better effect in wilted Italian ryegrass silage, and L. buchneri prolonged the aerobic stability of Italian ryegrass. DM content and purpose of ensiling should be the key factors for choosing different types of additives for Italian ryegrass silage.

AB Soy consumption has been associated with potential health benefits in reducing chronic diseases. These physiological functions have been attributed to soy proteins or more commonly to bioactive peptides. Thus, more studies are required to identify these bioactive peptides, and elucidate their biological mechanisms of action. In the present study, a novel peptide iglycin was purified from soybean seeds with a molecular mass of 3.88 kDa. Thereafter, iglycin reduced fasting blood glucose and restored insulin sensitivity of C57BL/6J mice on a high-fat diet with increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and AKT in adipose tissue. Furthermore, it improved glucose uptake, induced translocation of intracellular GLUT4 to plasma membrane and activation of insulin signaling in adipocytes under insulin-resistant condition. In addition, it decreased reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation and inhibited adipocyte apoptosis with improved mitochondrial function as evidenced by up-regulation of succinate dehydrogenase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP store. These data suggested that iglycin ameliorated insulin resistance via activation of insulin signaling, which was associated with inhibition of oxidative stress, adipocyte apoptosis, and improvement of mitochondrial function.

AB PDZK1-interacting protein 1(PDZK1IP1), also known as MAP17, is encoded by the PDZK1IP1 gene and is a membrane-associated protein. PDZK1IP1 have been proven to be a potent regulator of cancer cell proliferation. However, the role of PDZK1IP1 in regulating goat subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation is unknown. Here, we cloned the full-length coding sequence of PDZK1IP1 gene, investigated the potential functional of PDZK1IP1 in goat subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation by gaining or losing function in vitro. Our results indicated that goat PDZK1IP1 gene consists of 345 bp, encoding a protein of 114 amino acids containing a typical PDZK1IP1 (MAP17) super family domain. Overexpression of PDZK1IP1 significantly increased the number of EdU-positive cells and cell viability, and also upregulated mRNA expression of cell proliferation-associated genes including CCND1 and CDK2 in vitro cultured cells. Conversely, knockdown of PDZK1IP1 mediated by siRNA technique significantly inhibited subcutaneous preadipocyte proliferation and downregulated mRNA expression of cell proliferation-associated genes including CCNE1, CCND1 and CDK2. Collectively, these results suggested that PDZK1IP1 can promote proliferation of goat subcutaneous preadipocyte.

AB Phyllanthus emblica (PE), a traditional multiethnic herbal medicine, is commonly applied to treat liver diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that aqueous extract of PE (AEPE) could alleviate carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in vivo, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. The present study was undertaken to clarify the multitarget mechanisms of PE in treating liver fibrosis by proteomics clues. A CCl4-induced liver fibrosis rat model was established. The anti-liver fibrosis effects of chemical fractions from AEPE were evaluated by serum biochemical indicators and pathological staining. Additionally, tandem mass tag (TMT) - based quantitative proteomics technology was used to detect the hepatic differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, gene ontology (GO) enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were used to perform bioinformatics analysis of DEPs. Western blot analysis was used to verify the key potential targets regulated by the effective fraction of AEPE. The low-molecular-weight fraction of AEPE (LWPE) was determined to be the optimal anti-liver fibrosis active fraction, that could significantly improve ALT, AST, HA, Col IV, PCIII, LN, Hyp levels and reduce the pathological fibrotic lesion of liver tissue in model rats. A total of 195 DEPs were screened after LWPE intervention. GO analysis showed that the DEPs were related mostly to extracellular matrix organization, actin binding, and extracellular exosomes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEPs are mainly related to ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Combined with the GO, KEGG and Western blot results, COL1A2, ITGAV, TLR2, ACE, and PDGFRB may be potential targets for PE treatment of liver fibrosis. In conclusion, LWPE exerts therapeutic effects through multiple pathways and multiple targets regulation in the treatment of liver fibrosis. This study may provide proteomics clues for the continuation of research on liver fibrosis treatment with PE.

AB This study proposes a time-space compression (TSC) model and evaluates the TSC effect of high-speed rail (HSR) on a sample of 2662 classified tourist destinations from 2008 to 2019 in China with the help of GIS technology. Based on panel models, this study finds that, within five hours: (1) the TSC effect of HSR on tourist destinations in eastern and central China is three times stronger than that in western and north-eastern China; (2) the negative impact coefficient of TSC of HSR on tourist destination development in China within temporal distances (3 h, 4 h, 5 h) are -0.193, -0.117, and -0.091 respectively; and (3) the farther the temporal distance, the weaker the inhibitory effect. Results from this study contribute to the literature by providing empirical evidence of the potentially negative TSC effect on regional and tourism development. Findings provide managerial implications suggesting that tourist destinations should implement marketing policies to retain tourists and prevent the loss of tourists brought by the opening of HSR.

AB In the current source inverter (CSI)-fed inductor motor (IM) drive system, DC-bus inductance and AC-filter capacitance have a direct impact on the dynamic response speed, power quality and power density. In addition, due to the addition of filter capacitors, the mathematical model formed by the IM and capacitor is a third-order system, which increases the difficulty of parameter tuning for the control loop. To solve the above problems in the CSI, a DC-bus inductance design method based on current response speed and the ripple of the DC-link current and an AC-filter capacitance design method based on current utilization and filtering characteristics are presented. Then, the analytical expressions between the open-loop cut-off frequency, phase margin and the PI controller parameters of the current loop and speed loop are derived. Finally, an experimental platform is established to validate the proposed method.

AB Yak has evolved specific adaptative mechanisms to high-altitude environment. Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle, suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes. Overall, the present study contributes basic data at the DNA methylation level to further understand the physiological metabolism in yak.

AB First-principles calculations and positron annihilation spectroscopy were used to investigate the effect of Cr atoms on He-induced vacancy-like defects in pure Fe and Fe9Cr alloys. The He atom is not energetically favorable at both the surface and the subsurface, but it becomes stable under the third atomic layer from the surface. The diffusion of He atoms to the vacuum and aggregation of He atoms into clusters coexist. We observed that the interstitial He-n clusters prefer to stay along the (110) plane. Moreover, the small He-n clusters induce strong lattice distortions, and the emission of a self-interstitial Fe atom located at the adjacent He(n )cluster is energetically favorable for n > 2 and vacancy formation energies of Fe9Cr are higher than that of Fe. This suggests that Cr atoms could effectively enhance the stability of Fe atoms around Hen clusters but that the Fe atoms would still like to shift from the vicinity of He-n to the surfaces of the models. In the experiment, Fe and Fe9Cr alloys were irradiated with He ions to a dose of 1 x 10(16) cm(2) and the positron annihilation results showed that the Fe9Cr alloy has a smaller relative S (delta S) parameter value than pure Fe. The experimental results matched well with the theoretical analysis. These results would help provide additional insights into the behavior of He in irradiated Fe and Fe9Cr surfaces, necessary for the interpretation of the growth of the He bubble.

AB The vast majority (approximately 90%) of Lepidoptera species belong to moths whose phylogeny has been widely discussed and highly controversial. For the further understanding of phylogenetic relationships of moths, nineteen nearly complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of moths involved in six major lineages were sequenced and characterized. These mitogenomes ranged from 15,177 bp (Cyclidia fractifasciata) to 15,749 bp (Ophthalmitis albosignaria) in length, comprising of the core 37 mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) + 22 tRNAs + two rRNAs) and an incomplete control region. The order and orientation of genes showed the same pattern and the gene order of trnM-trnI-trnQ showed a typical rearrangement of Lepidoptera compared with the ancestral order of trnI-trnQ-trnM. Among these 13 PCGs, ATP8 exhibited the fastest evolutionary rate, and Drepanidae showed the highest average evolutionary rate among six families involved in 66 species. The phylogenetic analyses based on the dataset of 13 PCGs suggested the relationship of (Notodontidae + (Noctuidae + Erebidae)) + (Geometridae + (Sphingidae + Drepanidae)), which suggested a slightly different pattern from previous studies. Most groups were well defined in the subfamily level except Erebidae, which was not fully consistent across bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Several formerly unassigned tribes of Geometridae were suggested based on mitogenome sequences despite a not very strong support in partial nodes. The study of mitogenomes of these moths can provide fundamental information of mitogenome architecture, and the phylogenetic position of moths, and contributes to further phylogeographical studies and the biological control of pests.

AB Cooperation plays an essential role in the development of human civilization. How to promote the emergence of cooperation has always been a hot research topic. Addressed in this paper is the evolutionary process of voluntary public goods game on a regular lattice. A preferential-selection and expected-payoff mechanism is proposed to promote cooperation level. This mechanism combines two factors-preferential selection and expected payoff and possesses two conspicuous advantages: 1. Overcome some defects of reported mechanisms and be more reasonable. 2. Promote cooperation level of the considered game. Specially, simulations show that appropriate expected payoffs can improve cooperation level no matter what value of preference parameter is, avoiding excessively low cooperation rate when the preferential parameter is negative.

AB B-cell lymphoma is one of the most common types of lymphoma, and chemotherapy is still the current first-line treatment. However, due to the systemic side effects caused by chemotherapy drugs, traditional regimens have limitations and are difficult to achieve ideal efficacy. Recent studies have found that CD22 (also known as Siglec-2), as a specific marker of B-cells, is significantly up-regulated on B-cell lymphomas. Inspired by the specific recognition and binding of sialic acid residues by CD22, a polysialic acid (PSA)-modified PLGA nanocarrier (SAPC NP) designed to target B-cell lymphoma was fabricated. Mitoxantrone (MTO) was further loaded into SAPC NP through hydrophobic interactions to obtain polysialylated immunogenic cell death (ICD) nanoinducer (MTO@SAPC NP). Cellular experiments confirmed that MTO@SAPC NP could be specifically taken up by two types of CD22 + B lymphoma cells including Raji and Ramos cells, unlike the poor endocytic performance in other lymphocytes or macrophages. MTO@SAPC NP was determined to enhance the ICD and show better apoptotic effect on CD22 + cells. In the mouse model of B-cell lymphoma, MTO@SAPC NP significantly reduced the systemic side effects of MTO through lymphoma targeting, then achieved enhanced anti-tumor immune response, better tumor suppressive effect, and improved survival rate. Therefore, the polysialylated ICD nanoinducer provides a new strategy for precise therapy of B-cell lymphoma.

AB Plant litter can greatly alter community compositional dynamics and variability of intraspecific interactions in grasslands, and thus the overall ecosystem structure and functions. However, whether plant activity can be driven by plant litter to modify plant community heterogeneity remains poorly explored. We investigate the responses of plant community heterogeneity to litter addition as well as their associated mechanisms. Here we conducted a three-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow to explore the effects of multiple plant litter addition (five mass levels and three species) on plant communities. We found that the effect of litter manipu-lation on plant community heterogeneity was mainly driven by litter mass rather than litter species. Higher litter mass manipulation significantly enhanced plant community heterogeneity, which was mainly determined by the niche breadth of forbs and the distribution patterns of functional composition rather than plant diversity. Our findings provide significant insights for understanding the effects of plant litter on grassland ecosystem dynamics to maintain the structure and function of ecosystems. Furthermore, this study suggests that reasonable man-agement practices (e.g., moderate grazing in non-growing seasons) may be pivotal in achieving sustainability of grassland systems through plant litter dynamics.

AB This work is engaged in investigating the problem of stabilization of neural-network-based control systems (NNBCSs) via sampled-data (SD) control. Firstly, a time-dependent discontinuous bilateral looped-functional (DBLF) approach is proposed by fully considering the sampling state information, which relaxes the restriction of monotonicity. Then, a new lemma regarding sampled-data-based Lyapunov stability result is established for nonlinear systems, which is strictly proved by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Moreover, the proposed lemma improves the conventional Lyapunov theorem and weakens the asymptotic stability conditions of continuous-time systems into discrete conditional expression. In addition, a SD three-layer fully connected feed-forward neural network (TLFCFFNN) controller is considered to reach the maximum interval of sampling. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) is the key enzyme that catalyzes the last step of triglyceride synthesis. However, its role in intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in goat remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of DGAT2 in regulating goat IMF deposition. In the present study, the expression of DGAT2 was highest in goat triceps brachii, and highest on the first day after oleic acid induction in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. The overexpression of DGAT2 promoted the accumulation of lipid droplets and triglyceride synthesis, accompanied by the expression upregulation of DGAT1, TIP47, ACC and ACOX1 significantly, and expression downregulation of AGPAT6, LPIN1, LPL, HSL, ATGL and ADRP significantly. In contrast, the silencing of DGAT2 decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets, inhibited the expression of DGAT1, GPAM, ADRP, AGPAT6, LPL, HSL, ATGL, ACC, FASN, ACOX1 significantly, and enhanced that of TIP47 significantly. Overall, these data underscore DGAT2 may play a potentially important role in lipid droplets formation and triglyceride accumulation, so as to maintain intramuscular fat deposition, beyond triglyceride synthesis in goat.

AB It is necessary to obtain more recent data on the prevalence and co-occurrence of mycotoxins in feed and food to minimize risks. This study examined the recent presence, co-occurrence, and correlation patterns of six major ergot alkaloids (EAs; i.e. ergocornine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergometrine, ergosine, and ergotamine) in cool season adapted barley (n = 57) and wheat (n = 80) submitted by livestock producers and industries for testing ergot alkaloids/mycotoxins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Overall, 91% industry-submitted barley samples and 84% industry-submitted wheat samples tested positive for at least one ergot alkaloid and 33% industry-submitted barley and 38% industry-submitted wheat samples were found to be co-contaminated with all six major EAs. The content of total EAs in 9 industry-submitted barley (16%) and 18 industry-submitted wheat (23%) samples exceeded the recommended maximum allowable level for lactating or pregnant animals (250 ppb). All the barley and wheat samples that contained detectable ergosine were found to co-occur with other EAs. Overall, the content of individual EAs was positively correlated with each other and strong correlations (r > 0.8, P < 0.01) were detected between the content of individual EAs and total EAs. These results implied that the industry and producers submitted cool-season adapted barley and wheat samples contaminated with a single EA is likely to contain high levels of other major EAs. The patterns of individual EAs in this study were distinct from previous studies that focus on samples from European countries. Ergocristine was remained as the predominant EAs in the industry-submitted cool-season adapted barley and wheat samples at levels up to 9438.8 and 12416.2 ppb, respectively. While the mean contents of ergosine were the lowest (68.5 and 50.6 ppb for the industry-submitted cool-season adapted barley and wheat samples, respectively). The high prevalence and co-occurrence of EAs indicated that ergot contamination is still posing a significant threat to food and feed industry and more research is expected to reduce the contamination level and explore the toxicological significance of various co-occurrence profiles. A full scale of investigation for all barley and wheat samples is needed to obtain a full picture of mycotoxin contamination.

AB Background Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HnRNP) F is a member of HnRNP family proteins that participate in splicing of cellular newly synthesized mRNAs by specifically recognizing tandem guanine-tracts (G-tracts) RNA sequences. Whether HnRNP F could recognize viral-derived tandem G-tracts and affect virus replication remain poorly defined. Methods The effect of HnRNP F on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) propagation was evaluated by real-time PCR, western blotting, and plaque-forming unit assay. The association between HnRNP F and PRRSV guanine-rich segments (GRS) were analyzed by RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation. The expression pattern of HnRNP F was investigated by western blotting and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation. Results Knockdown of endogenous HnRNP F effectively blocks the synthesis of viral RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Conversely, overexpression of porcine HnRNP F has the opposite effect. Moreover, RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation assays reveal that the qRMM1 and qRRM2 domains of HnRNP F recognize the GRS in PRRSV antigenomic RNA. Finally, HnRNP F is redistributed into the cytoplasm and forms a complex with guanine-quadruplex (G4) helicase DHX36 during PRRSV infection. Conclusions These findings elucidate the potential functions of HnRNP F in regulating the proliferation of PRRSV and contribute to a better molecular understanding of host-PRRSV interactions.

AB Background: There have been many studies on the relationship between circRNAs and fat deposition. Although the liver is a central organ for fat metabolism, there are few reports on the relationship between circRNAs in the liver and fat deposition. Methods: In this study, we systematically analyzed circular RNAs in the liver of Ningxiang pigs, at four time points after birth (30 days, 90 days, 150 days and 210 days). Results: A total of 3705 circRNAs were coexpressed in four time periods were found, and KEGG analysis showed that the significantly upregulated pathways were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, while significantly downregulated pathways were mainly related to signal transduction, such as ECM-receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. Short time-series expression miner (STEM) analysis showed multiple model spectra that were significantly enriched over time in the liver. By constructing a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network, 9187 pairs of networks related to the change in development time were screened. Conclusions: The expression profiles of circRNAs in Ningxiang pig liver were revealed at different development periods, and it was determined that there is differential coexpression. Through enrichment analysis of these circRNAs, it was revealed that host genes were involved in metabolism-related signaling pathways and fatty acid anabolism. Through STEM analysis, many circRNAs involved in fat metabolism, transport, and deposition pathways were screened, and the first circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulation network map in Ningxiang pig liver was constructed. The highly expressed circRNAs related to fat deposition were verified and were consistent with RNA-Seq results.

AB Barium titanate (BT)-based ceramics are one of the promising piezoelectric materials for environment-friendly electro-mechanical transformation. However, high performance materials are often sintered at high temperatures, resulting in volatile components and increased energy consumption. Here, 0.82Ba(Ti0.89Sn0.11)O-3-(0.18-x)(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3-xBiFeO(3) (BTS-BCT-xBF) piezoelectric ceramics were prepared by microwave sintering (MWS) method, and the structure and properties were emphatically studied, aiming to reveal the regulatory mechanism of MWS on the structure and properties. Compared with conventional solid sintering (CS), the phase structure presents a similar evolution in MWS ceramics as a function of BF, while the more refined grain size and the denser structure are observed in MWS ceramics. The electrical properties (e.g., d(33), epsilon(r), tan delta, etc.) of MWS ceramics are superior to the CS ceramics owing to the refined grain size and denser microstructure. It is worth noting that the energy storage performance (e.g., energy storage density, energy storage efficiency) significantly outperformed expectations due to the slender hysteresis loop resulting from the smaller grain and high cubic phase. Therefore, the MWS sintering mechanism can further drive practical application of BT-based ceramics.

AB Objectives To investigate the transmission and origination of MRSA in livestock with limited antimicrobial use. Yak (Bos grunniens) herds in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, China were chosen for sampling.
   Methods The yaks from all 18 districts of Ganzi were sampled (anal swabs, n = 657; nasal swabs, n = 634). Based on the WGS data of 83 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the novel structure of the yak S. aureus population was described. Phylogenetic analyses were utilized for determining the origin of the MRSA lineage in yaks.
   Results The yak S. aureus population consisted of 11 STs, 6 of which were previously undescribed, with ST6267 being the predominant novel ST. These isolates were generally susceptible to most of the tested antibiotics and lacked the associated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) but showed high penicillin MIC values (MIC90 = 32 mg/L), which were consistent with the high positivity rate for blaZ (61/83). The MRSA identified in yaks were all ST59 and most likely of human origin. The yak ST59 MRSA each carried the human immune evasion cluster (IEC) while lacking the ARGs that are identified in the majority of reported Chinese human ST59 MRSA isolates [erm(B), ant6-Ia and aph(3 '')-III].
   Conclusions The yak herds living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are important livestock and follow the traditional free-grazing farming model. We surveyed the yak S. aureus population and found that all the yak MRSA isolates belonged to the lineage that might originate from the prevalent community-acquired MRSA ST59 in China. From a 'One Health' perspective, the transmission of human MRSA to farming animals with limited antimicrobial exposure highlights the multiple roles of animals in the expansion of MRSA.

AB To reduce the interference of impulsive noise when the spline adaptive filter (SAF) algorithm is used to identify nonlinear systems, this paper proposes a family of SAF algorithms using the Heaviside step function (HSF). The suitability of those cost functions proposed are investigated; those cost functions are design based on some HSF's approximate functions. Then based on that, four SAF algorithms have been developed: SAF-HSF-sigmoid, SAF-HSF-erfc, SAF-HSF-atan, and SAF-HSF-tanh. Also, the bound of the learning rate has been derived for those proposed algorithms. The proposed SAF-HSF algorithms have been evaluated for nonlinear system identification and simulation studies to demonstrate their robustness.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential chiral recognition functions induced by two kinds of novel chiral microenvironment-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN) for the oral delivery of the poorly water-soluble achiral drug indomethacin (IMC). The as-synthesized CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN with molecular chirality and high specific surface area (S-BET: 1141 and 1075 m(2)/g, respectively) were successfully prepared through grafting chiral molecular functional groups. The characterization results showed that CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN were spherical nanoparticles with opposite chiral features and clearly visible pore channels. Meanwhile, they exhibited good biosafety and degradability. In vitro drug release study indicated that both CMR-L-MSN and CMR-D-MSN significantly improved IMC dissolution compared with naked-MSN (N-MSN) (p < 0.05) and exhibited different chiral recognition functions for drug release in the simulated chiral environments in vitro (pH 6.8 PBS-D/L), in which CMR-D-MSN could be triggered by the L-configurations in chiral environments and exhibited a better drug release effect. As expect, the results of in vivo biological effects disclosed that CMR-D-MSN had higher bioavailability of IMC and obvious advantages on drug adsorption and in vivo distribution, and exerted stronger anti-inflammatory effect after making specific response to the in vivo chiral environment.

AB Six perennial herbs (Plantago asiatica, Polygonum viviparum, Anaphalis lactea, Kobresia humilis, Leontopodium nanum and Potentilla chinensis) widely distributed in alpine meadows were reciprocally transplanted at two sites in eastern edge of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Hongyuan (3434 m, 2.97 degrees C, 911 mm) and Qilian (3701 m, 2.52 degrees C, 472 mm), aiming to evaluate the responses of alpine plants to changing environments. When plants were transplanted from Hongyuan to Qilian, most plant species showed a decrease of total wax coverage in first year and reverse trend was observed for some plant species in second year. However, when plants were transplanted from Qilian to Hongyuan, the response of total wax coverage differed greatly between plant species. When compared with those in first year, plasticity index of average chain length of alkane decreased whereas carbon preference index of alkane increased at both Hongyuan and Qilian in second year. The total wax coverage differed between local and transplanted plants, suggesting both environmental and genetic factors controlled the wax depositions. Structural equation modeling indicated that co-variations existed between leaf cuticular waxes and leaf functional traits. These results suggest that alpine herbs adjust both wax depositions and chain length distributions to adapt to changing environment, showing climate adaptations.

AB Sacred natural sites, as probably the oldest form of habitat reserve for religious or cultural causes worldwide, are suggested to have an important role in conserving vegetation; however, there are insufficient data supporting the detailed implications of such sites for vegetation conservation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of vegetation conservation on a Tibetan sacred mountain in Yajiang County, Sichuan, China, by investigating species richness and the structural attributes of higher vascular plant communities on and around the sacred mountain from April to June 2009. The results showed that the number of tree species on the sacred mountain was significantly higher than that in the surrounding area, but there were no notable differences in the numbers of shrub and grass species between the two sites. The sacred mountain harbored a greater number of small, short trees compared with the surrounding area, wherein the low-shrub and grass understory was relatively dense. We conclude that the sacred mountain has a positive impact on indigenous vegetation protection, but disparities in the management of the allowed uses of such sites could reduce their conservation effectiveness.

TI A Blockchain-Based Auto Insurance Data Sharing Scheme
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Auto electronic insurance policy and electronic maintenance list record the entire process of auto owners purchasing auto insurance and repairs after accident, respectively. They play a vital role in auto owners' applications for claims and insurance company's judgment on whether to settle the claims. However, the privacy of insurance policy and the "information island" resulting from the nonsharing of data between users make the claim has low efficiency. The notable features of blockchain technology are decentralization and tamper-proof, which can well solve data sharing and privacy protection. This paper proposes a blockchain-based auto insurance data sharing scheme to improve the existing auto insurance claim system. The scheme includes four main bodies: auto owner, insurance company, 4S Shop, and government authority. In the proposed scheme, the data sharing of authorized users is realized through proxy reencryption. Finally, we have analyzed the security and performance of the solution. The analysis results show that the proposed scheme can meet many security features such as user access control and data tamper resistance and has an ideal calculation and communication cost.

AB The present study aimed to explore the toxic effects of excessive dietary Mn in livers and cerebrums of Jianzhou Da'er goat (Capra hircus). Three-month old goats were assigned into three groups: control group, fed on basal diet; Mn I group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl2 (2.5 g/kg); Mn II group, fed on the basal diet mixed with MnCl2 (5 g/kg). Compared with the control group, the activities of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased, but the concentrations of IgG in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The activities of superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased, whereas the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased in livers and cerebrums (p < 0.05). Moreover, the hepatocytes necrosed, inflammatory cells infiltrated, chromatin concentrated, mitochondrial cristae reduced in Mn I and Mn II groups. The nerve cells necrosed, blood vessels congested, inflammatory cells infiltrated, mitochondrial electron density and mitochondrial cristae decreased, and vacuolization increased in Mn I and Mn II groups. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1), fas-associated protein via a death domain (FADD), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase 3, 8, 9 (Caspase-3, 8, 9) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the mRNA expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in livers. The mRNA expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, 9, 7, 12 in Mn I and Mn II groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05), however, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in Mn I and Mn II groups was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in cerebrums. In summary, our results provided new insights for better understanding the mechanisms of Mn toxicity in Capra hircus.

AB To better perform distributed estimation, this paper, by combining the Fair cost function and adapt-then-combine scheme at all distributed network nodes, a novel diffusion adaptive estimation algorithm is proposed from an M-estimator perspective, which is called the diffusion Fair (DFair) adaptive filtering algorithm. The stability of the mean estimation error and the computational complexity of the DFair are theoretically analyzed. Compared with the robust diffusion LMS (RDLMS), diffusion Normalized Least Mean M-estimate (DNLMM), diffusion generalized correntropy logarithmic difference (DGCLD), and diffusion probabilistic least mean square (DPLMS) algorithms, the simulation experiment results show that the DFair algorithm is more robust to input signals and impulsive interference. In conclusion, Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the DFair algorithm performs better when estimating an unknown linear system in the changeable impulsive interference environments.

AB In this article, our goal is to establish fast and efficient numerical methods for nonlinear space-fractional convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations in the 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. For the spatial discretization of the CDR equations, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is used to approximate the convection term, and the fractional centered difference formula is applied to deal with the diffusion term. As a result, a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is derived. Since implicit integration factor (IIF) methods are a class of time-stepping schemes with good robustness and stability, the second order IIF-WENO scheme on non-uniform meshes in Jiang and Zhang (J Comput Phys 253:368-388, 2013) is applied to solve the nonlinear ODEs system. In order to obtain an efficient implementation of the IIF-WENO scheme, we propose an adaptive restarting Krylov subspace method to compute the action of matrix exponentials arising in IIF-WENO. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the validity of the IIF-WENO scheme, and to verify that the proposed fast solution algorithm is extremely attractive in terms of computational complexity and memory storage.

TI Ablation of KDM2A Inhibits Preadipocyte Proliferation and Promotes

AB Epigenetic signals and chromatin-modifying proteins play critical roles in adipogenesis, which determines the risk of obesity and which has recently attracted increasing interest. Histone demethylase 2A (KDM2A) is an important component of histone demethylase; however, its direct effect on fat deposition remains unclear. Here, a KDM2A loss of function was performed using two unbiased methods, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and Cre-Loxp recombinase systems, to reveal its function in adipogenesis. The results show that the knockdown of KDM2A by siRNAs inhibited the proliferation capacity of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, the promotion of preadipocyte differentiation was observed in siRNA-treated cells, manifested by the increasing content of lipid droplets and the expression level of adipogenic-related genes. Consistently, the genetic deletion of KDM2A by Adipoq-Cre in primary adipocytes exhibited similar phenotypes to those of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Interestingly, the knockdown of KDM2A upregulates the expression level of Transportin 1(TNPO1), which in turn may induce the nuclear translocation of PPAR gamma and the accumulation of lipid droplets. In conclusion, the ablation of KDM2A inhibits preadipocyte proliferation and promotes its adipogenic differentiation. This work provides direct evidence of the exact role of KDM2A in fat deposition and provides theoretical support for obesity therapy that targets KDM2A.

AB To explore the structural rationality and potential applications of the hypothetical chemically ordered double transition metal silicides MAX-phase Nb2ZrSiC2 and Nb2TiSiC2, we used density functional theory to systematically study the crystal structure and related properties of them and compared with the case of Nb3SiC2. Through the calculations of elastic constant and phonon dispersive curves, the stability of these three ceramics were investigated. Results show they are stable in mechanics and lattice dynamics. Then, normalized bond lengths as function of pressure for these compounds were computed to discuss their bond stiffness. In addition, the calculations of the densities of states for them indicate that they are all metallic-like conductors. And then, the calculations of dielectric function and reflectivity for these ceramics were performed to explore their optical properties. The good reflectivity performance in the infrared and close infrared region means they are potential coating materials on spacecraft in the future. At the end of this work, the Debye temperatures of these three ceramics compounds were obtained by calculating their longitudinal, transverse and mean and velocities, and results indicate they all exhibit a relatively good high temperature resistance.

AB Kengyilia is a group of allohexaploid species that arose from two hybridization events followed by genome doubling of three ancestral diploid species with different genomes St, Y, and P in the Triticeae. Estimating the phylogenetic relationship in resolution of the maternal lineages has been difficult, owing to the extremely low rate of sequence divergence. Here, phylogenetic reconstructions based on the plastome sequences were used to explore the role of maternal progenitors in the establishment of Kengyilia polyploid species. The plastome sequences of 11 Kengyilia species were analyzed together with 12 tetraploid species (PP, StP, and StY) and 33 diploid taxa representing 20 basic genomes in the Triticeae. Phylogenomic analysis and genetic divergence patterns suggested that (1) Kengyilia is closely related to Roegneria, Pseudoroegneria, Agropyron, Lophopyrum, Thinopyrum, and Dasypyrum; (2) both the StY genome Roegneria tetraploids and the PP genome Agropyron tetraploids served as the maternal donors during the speciation of Kengyilia species; (3) the different Kengyilia species derived their StY genome from different Roegneria species. Multiple origins of species via independent polyploidization events have occurred in the genus Kengyilia, resulting in a maternal haplotype polymorphism. This helps explain the rich diversity and wide adaptation of polyploid species in the genus Kengyilia.

AB The corpus luteum (CL) is a temporary organ that plays a critical role for female fertility by maintaining the estrous cycle. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non-coding RNAs involved in various biological processes. However, there exists limited knowledge of the role of miRNA in yak CL. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to study the transcriptome dynamics of miRNA in yak early (eCL), middle (mCL) and late-stage CL (lCL). A total of 6,730 miRNAs were identified, including 5,766 known and 964 novels miRNAs. Three miRNAs, including bta-miR-126-3p, bta-miR-143 and bta-miR-148a, exhibited the highest expressions in yak CLs of all the three stages. Most of the miRNAs were 20-24 nt in length and the peak was at 22 nt. Besides, most miRNAs with different lengths displayed significant uracil preference at the 5'-end. Furthermore, 1,067, 280 and 112 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were found in eCL vs. mCL, mCL vs. lCL, and eCL vs. lCL, respectively. Most of the DE miRNAs were down-regulated in the eCL vs. mCL and eCL vs. lCL groups, and up-regulated in the mCL vs. lCL group. A total of 18,904 target genes were identified, with 18,843 annotated. Pathway enrichment analysis of the DE miRNAs target genes illustrated that the most enriched cellular process in each group included pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt pathway, endocytosis, and focal adhesion. A total of 20 putative target genes in 47 DE miRNAs were identified to be closely associated with the formation, function or regression of CL. Three DE miRNAs, including bta-miR-11972, novel-miR-619 and novel-miR-153, were proved to directly bind to the 3'-UTR of their predicated target mRNAs, including CDK4, HSD17B1 and MAP1LC3C, respectively. Both of these DE miRNAs and their target mRNAs exhibited dynamic expression profiles across the lifespan of yak CL. This study presents a general basis for understanding of the regulation of miRNA on yak CL and also provides a novel genetic resource for future analysis of the gene network during the estrous cycle in the yak.

AB Revegetation using perennial grass, such as Elymus nutans is an effective approach in abating grassland degradation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, knowledge of root dynamics along restoration chronosequences of revegetated grasslands are limited. To gain better insight into root dynamics, we used minirhizotrons to examine changes in root traits, including root standing crop, production, mortality, and turnover along a restoration chronosequence of three revegetated grasslands (cultivated in 2002, 2006, and 2010 corresponding to late, middle, and early recovery stage) in four consecutive growing seasons (2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017). We found that the aboveground plant biomass was higher in the middle recovery stage than that in the early and late recovery stages, while plant species richness showed an increasing trend from the early to late recovery stage. Similar with the plant biomass response, the belowground root standing crop and production were significantly higher in the middle recovery stage than in the early and late recovery stages. Root mortality was decreased and root turnover tend to be stable from the early to late recovery stage. Root turnover was positively correlated with soil NO3--N content and negatively correlated with aboveground plant biomass. Moreover, root standing crop and mortality increased from May to September across all growing seasons; however, root production decreased within this period. Our study highlighted significant links between aboveground and belowground plant parts that may help effectively manage revegetated grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB IFITM3 is interferon-induced transmembrane 3, which plays an extremely key role in anti-proliferation, antivirus and anti-tumor diseases. In this study, the yak (Bos grunniens) IFITM3 (BgIFITM3) gene contained a 5 '-untranslated region (UTR) (25 bp), a coding region (441 bp), and a 3 '-UTR (115 bp). The expression of BgIFITM3 gene in liver was significantly higher than that in heart, spleen, lung and kidney (P < 0.01). BgIFITM3 protein was localized on the yak hepatocyte plasma membrane, and its expression was significantly different between 1 day and 15 months of age (P < 0.05). Moreover, the prokaryotic expression vector of BgIFITM3 protein was constructed and expressed successfully, with a molecular weight of 19.5 kDa. The activities of yak hepatocyte were significantly inhibited after treating with BgIFITM3 protein (10 and 20 mu g/mL) (P < 0.01). The expression levels of ERBB-2, IRS-1, PI3KR-1, AKT-1 and MAPK-3 were significantly lower after treating with 20 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein (P < 0.05). Besides, the activities of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treating with BgIFITM3 protein (1, 10 and 20 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). While, the cloning ability and migration ability of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treating with 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein (P < 0.05). Finally, the mitochondria of HepG2 cells was concentrated, cristae widened, and the double film density of mitochondria was increased after treating with 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein. After 10 mu g/mL BgIFITM3 protein treating, the expression levels of VDAC-2, VDAC-3 and p53 genes were significantly increased, but the expression level of GPX-4 gene was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). Taken together, the BgIFITM3 protein could inhibit the proliferations of yak hepatocyte and HepG2 cells by regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway or ferroptosis-related genes, respectively. These results benefit for further study of the function of BgIFITM3 protein.

TI Development and use of a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR

SO ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Bovine torovirus (BToV) is an important diarrhea-causing pathogen affecting bovines. To facilitate BToV detection, a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay was developed that targets the BToV M gene with high specificity and reproducibility. The assay has a limit of detection of 23 copies/mu L. Out of 69 diarrheic fecal samples from yaks collected on six farms in Tibet and Sichuan provinces in China, 11.59% (8/69) tested positive for BToV using this assay. The full-length spike (S) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes of three positive samples were subsequently sequenced. Notably, an identical recombination event was identified in the S1 subunit of the S protein of three isolates. All of the HE genes were found to belong to genotype III and shared the same unique aa variation (P44S) in the esterase domain. This study is the first confirmation of BToV in yaks and the first report of an S gene recombination event in BToV. Our findings will enhance the current understanding of the molecular characteristics and genetic evolution of BToV.

AB The present work focuses on in situ studying the transformation process of collagen molecules and fibrils in pigskin along with hydrothermal shrinkage. The results indicate that the triple helix of collagen molecules is firstly destabilized by hydrothermal treatment and more water molecules enter the space of three polypeptide chains of collagen molecules to slight increase the diameter of collagen fibrils. Then, the thermally labile domain of collagen molecules unfolds first to form tiny nodules. The nodules are shrinkage foci, which enlarge further and finally coalesce resulting in the shrinkage of pigskin. During the shrinkage process, the diameter of fibrils increases sharply. The spaces between collagen fibrils and fibers are compressed to form a more compact space arrangement than original extended forms, resulting in extrusion of water molecules. After shrinkage, partial fibrils structure was still observed and retained their characteristic banding patterns. Subsequently, the residual fibrils structure gradually disappeared and degraded.

AB Adipocyte differentiation, which plays an important role in fat deposition, involves a complex molecular mechanism. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential in this progress. Here, we showed that miR-25-3p expression had increased during goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation, which peaked at day 3. Using liposome transfection and qRT-PCR techniques, we found that knocking down miR-25-3p reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets by downregulating or upregulating the expression of LPL, PPAR gamma, AP2, SREBPI, and C/EBP beta but upregulating the expression of KLF4. Overexpression of miR-25-3p results in the opposite. Furthermore, the dual luciferase assay showed that overexpression of miR-25-3p significantly inhibited luciferase activity of KLF4. These results showed that miR-25-3p has a binding site within the 3'-UTR of KLF4 mRNA. Together, these findings indicate that miR-25-3p is a positive regulator of intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation via targeting to KLF4 in goats.

DT Article
ID EFFICIENT; ALLOCATION
AB Given the importance of multicast traffic in current optical networks, many effective multicast routing and spectrum assignment (MRSA) algorithms have been proposed to achieve efficient multicast transmission in elastic optical networks (EONs). However, most of these MRSA algorithms were focus on optimizing only the spectrum resources allocated to multicast service requests, but ignored some fragmented spectrum resources remained after spectrum allocation. Although some fragment-aware MRSA algorithms were proposed for EONs to restrain the fragmented spectrum generated in provisioning multicast transmission, they could hardly precisely compute the amount of the fragmented resources while optimizing the allocated resources for the multicast transmission in EONs. This is because that the fragmented and the allocated spectrum resources always have different duration characteristics. In this paper, we propose a time-based composite-consumption-aware (TCCA) MRSA algorithm to optimize both the fragmented and the allocated resources consumed by the multicast transmission in EONs. By additionally taking the holding time of each multicast service request into account, the proposed algorithm can comprehensively optimize both the fragmented and the allocated resource consumption for the multicast transmission in EONs. Since the comprehensive resource consumption, including both the fragmented and the allocated resource consumption, is optimized by the proposed TCCA algorithm, more available resources can be remained for the subsequent multicast requests, which can increase the request blocking performance in EONs. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can reduce the comprehensive resource consumption for the multicast transmission in EONs with low request blocking probability.

AB Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays an important regulatory role in the activation of T cells induced by mitogenic or antigenic stimuli. However, the immunologic property of MIF in freshwater fish is limitedly known by now. In the present study, MIF gene was identified in grass carp. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the molecular weight of grass carp MIF protein was 12.377 kDa and it could also bind to CD74. MIF gene was predominantly expressed in immune tissues including spleen and head kidney, then liver, skin, gill, intestine and blood, while a relative low level expression in heart, brain, fat and red muscle. The predicted receptor and tissues distribution of MIF implied the immunologic activity of grass carp MIF. Then grass carp MIF antigen and the polyclonal antibodies against it were prepared. Using cadmium as an immunosuppressive agent, MIF expression in spleen and head kidney was depressed in a dose-dependent manner with cadmium consumption. On the same time, white blood cell count decrease displayed a similar pattern with MIF expression, which suggested a possible positive correlation between MIF and white blood cell count. Thereafter, MIF enhanced the viability of grass carp peripheral blood leukocytes and inhibited cell apoptosis with depressed reactive oxygen species production in vitro. In addition, recombinant grass carp MIF promoted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta) and interleukin 6 (IL6) secretion from peripheral blood leukocytes. These results indicated the immunologic property of grass carp MIF.

AB Vanadium (V) is an ultratrace metal with the insulin-tropic properties and is often researched as the diabetes drug. However, in animals, V has been reported to have toxic effects on the development, immunity, oxidation-reduction equilibrium, gastrointestinal function, and so forth. Especially in poultry, supplementation of more than 10 mg of V/kg in the layer diets has been shown to adversely affect the egg production and egg quality. In this study, we supplemented 0 mg of V/kg, 5 mg of V/kg, and 10 mg of V/kg in the layer diets for 35 D and examined the quantitative proteomics of albumen for finding the possible target signaling pathway and mechanism of V action and made the preliminary verification. In contrast to the control group, V resulted in a significant drop in the albumen height, and in oviduct ampulla, the activity of total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase significantly decreased (P = 0.01, P = 0.02), the content of malonic dialdehyde significantly increased (P = 0.01), and the apoptosis rate significantly increased in the 5-mg V/kg and 10-mg V/kg treatment groups (P < 0.01). V affected 36 differentially accumulated proteins in albumen, with 23 proteins upregulated and 13 proteins downregulated. The expressions of innate protein albumen lysozyme (Q6LEL2), vitellogenin-2 (P02845), and the F1NWD0 protein in albumen belonged to the P53 family were significantly reduced, in contrast to the control (P < 0.05), and the expression of riboflavin-binding protein (P02752) was significantly improved (P < 0.05). The Hippo signaling pathway-fly, which is suitable for the key protein P53 as the most significantly affected network, might be important for discriminating V.

AB An enantioselective (92-99% ee) Michael/aldol cascade reaction between 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetates and alpha,beta-unsaturated enones was established in the presence of cinchona alkaloid-based primary amines. Various beta-CF3-cyclohexanones were constructed in high yields (81-99%) as a couple of separable diastereomers. This tandem reaction was sensitive to acidic co-catalysts, with a Michael/aldol condensation process favorably occurring to generate beta-CF3-cyclohexenones (42-69% yield, 84-96% ee) in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid.

AB Adult male muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) has a pair of scent glands which secret musk to attract females during the breeding stage. The goal of the present study was to investigate the genetic mechanisms of musk secretion of muskrats at the whole genome level. Comparative genomics illustrated obvious expansion in 809 gene families, of which nine gene families played pivotal roles in steroid biosynthesis, possibly related to muskrat musk secretion. We identified 1112 positively selected genes (PSGs) in the muskrat, including estrogen receptor 1 (ER1), an important influencing factor to the weight and size of the scented glands of muskrats. HSD17B3, HSD] 784, CYP7B1 and CYP17B1 , crucial to steroid hormone biosynthesis, were under strong positive selection in the muskrat, and phylogenetic analysis of HSD and CYP450 classes revealed high gene diversity. Functional enrichment revealed many pathways associated with musk secretion and/or growth and degeneration of scented gland significantly, such as peroxisome, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, apoptosis, and prostate cancer. Two muskrat-specific missense mutations (Pro237Thr and Ser29711e) were detected in LIPC, which were reported to be involved cholesterol metabolic process. More importantly, the missense mutations discovered in LIPC were classified as deleterious by PolyPhen-2, possibly affecting the musk secretion of muskrats.

AB Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that the existence of breast cancer-initiating cells, which drives the original tumorigenicity, local invasion and migration propensity of breast cancer. These cells, termed as breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), possess properties including self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation and proliferative potential, and are believed to play important roles in the intrinsic drug resistance of breast cancer. One of the reasons why BCBCs cause difficulties in breast cancer treating is that BCBCs can control both genetic and non-genetic elements to keep their niches safe and sound, which allows BCSCs for constant self-renewal and differentiation. Therapeutic strategies designed to target BCSCs may ultimately result in effective interventions for the treatment of breast cancer. Novel strategies including nanomedicine, oncolytic virus therapy, immunotherapy and induced differentiation therapy are emerging and proved to be efficient in anti-BCSCs therapy. In this review, we summarized breast tumor biology and the current challenges of breast cancer therapies, focused on breast cancer stem cells, and introduced promising therapeutic strategies targeting BCSCs.

AB The emergence of mobile colistin resistance mcr genes undermines the efficacy of colistin as the last-resort drug for multi-drug resistance infections and constitutes a great public health concern. Plasmids play a critical role in the transmission of mcr genes among bacteria. One colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain of chicken origin was collected and analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, conjugation assay and S1-PFGE. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach combining Illumina and MinION platforms was utilized to decipher the underlying colistin resistance mechanism and genetic context. A novel mcr-8.2-bearing plasmid p2019036D-mcr8-345kb with 345 655 bp in size encoding various resistance genes including floR, sul1, aadA16, aadA2, blaCTX- M-27, blaDHA-1, tet(D), dfrA12 and qnrB4 was identified responsible for the colistin resistance phenotype. Plasmid comparison has shown that the mcr-8.2-bearing plasmid differed from other reported plasmids positive for mcr-8.2 but shared the same core mcr-8.2-bearing conserved region. This study demonstrates the emergence of mcr-8.2-bearing K. pneumoniae of animal origin is a potential risk to humans.

AB Based on field geological survey and stratigraphic profile survey in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the basic characteristics and evolution of geological structure in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are studied. The Dongyuan area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is divided into the late Cenozoic period and the current period. During the late Cenozoic, the Pliocene Xigeda lacustrine deposits develops from 41 MaBP to 2.6 MaBP, with 9 cold-warm climate change stages. There are 4.3 MaBP old glacial period in this area, and 5 extreme paleoclimate events in Quaternary. At present, the horizontal movement intensity and mode of different tectonic zones are determined by the northward extrusion, eastward extrusion and rotation around the eastern tectonic junction in the study area, and the stages of the movement state changing with time are related to the gestation and occurrence of extra-large earthquakes. At present, the three-dimensional crustal movement shows that the tectonic activity differentiation of mountain and basin, which is related to tectonic dynamic environment and deep material activity, is related to the compression, shortening and uplift of plateau mountain and the extension and subsidence of basin, reflecting the inheritance of neotectonic activity. Through practical analysis, it is found that the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is composed of Minshan fault block and Longmenshan structural belt. The left-lateral dislocation of Minjiang fault is roughly the same as the vertical dislocation. In Longmenshan tectonic belt. the right-lateral dislocation of Maowen-Wenchuan fault, Beichtian-Yingxiu fault and other main faults is the same as the vertical dislocation.

AB This paper is concerned with the leader-following consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems under directed topology graph. Compared with the most of the prior works, we assume that the state information is unknown for each following agent and only the relative output information between neighboring agents can be measured. Then, two new types of functional observer-based output feedback event-triggered protocols are designed, where the Kx-functional observer designed in this paper may have lower dimension than the full-order and reduced-order observer, which can ensure that leader-following consensus is achieved. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is excluded by showing that the inter-event time between any two triggering events is lower bounded by a strictly positive value. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, the global and local accessibility indexes of each park unit are computed based on an accessibility model that takes into account the surrounding population and its proximity to the park unit. Integrated in the model is a distance decay coefficient that is derived from U.S. national park visitor surveys and therefore pertinent to the case of study. Then correlation analysis is performed between park visitation and accessibility based on park types, regions, and visitation types. Results show that total visitation is positively related to accessibility in National Memorials, Military Parks and Battlefield Parks/Sites but negatively related to accessibility in national parks and national monuments. However, recreational overnight stay visits are commonly negatively correlated to accessibility for almost all park types. Moreover, local accessibility index displays enhanced correlation coefficients with improved significance levels in many categories of analysis. Results suggest that historical/cultural national parks which often show positive correlations tend to attract more local visitors, but nature-based parks which mainly show negative correlations tend to attract more distant visitors.

AB Modulating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with small drug-like molecules targeting it exhibits great promise in modern drug discovery. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of targeted proteins and could form dimers in living biological cells through PPIs. However, compared to drug development of the orthosteric site, there has been lack of investigations on the druggability of the PPI interface for GPCRs and its functional implication on experiments. Thus, in order to address these issues, we constructed a novel computational strategy, which involved in molecular dynamics simulation, virtual screening and protein structure network (PSN), to study one representative GPCR homodimer (CXCR4). One druggable pocket was identified in the PPI interface and one small molecule targeting it was screened, which could strengthen PPI mainly through hydrophobic interaction between the benzene rings of the PPI molecule and TM4 of the receptor. The PSN results further reveals that the PPI molecule could increase the number of the allosteric regulation pathways between the druggable pocket of the dimer interface to the orthostatic site for the subunit A but only play minor role for the other subunit B, leading to the asymmetric change in the volume of the binding pockets for the two subunits (increase for the subunit A and minor change for the subunit B). Consequently, the screening performance of the subunit A to the antagonists is enhanced while the subunit B is unchanged nearly, implying that the PPI molecule may be beneficial to enhance the drug efficacies of the antagonists. In addition, one main regulation pathway with the highest frequency was identified for the subunit A, which consists of Trp195(5.34)-Tyr190(ECL2)-Val196(5.35)-Gln200(5.39)-Asp262(6.58)-Cys28(N-term), revealing their importance in the allosteric regulation from the PPI molecule. The observations from the work could provide valuable information for the development of the PPI drug-like molecule for GPCRs.

AB MiR-155 regulates the development of germinal-center and the generation of immunoglobulin class-switched plasma cells. However, whether miR-155 is involved in immune response in fish is still unclear. Here, CIK cells transfected with miR-155 overexpressed plasmid inhibited mRNA expression of mlg and Rag2 (P < 0.05). Interestingly, mlg was predicted as a potential target gene of miR-155 by RNAhybrid, with a putative binding site in its CDS. Further, mlg luciferase reporter vectors with successive deletions of mlg cDNA sequence were constructed and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that vectors containing the sequence from 318 to 347 in CDS exhibited lower relative luciferase activity than others without predicted binding region (P < 0.05), which indicated mlg is the target gene of miR-155 and reveal bona fide targeted binding site of mlg for miR-155 in fish. In vivo, the zebrafish were respectively injected with miR-155 overexpressed and empty vector, and showed that miR-155 efficiently expressed in zebrafish (P < 0.01), which consistently decreased mRNA level of immune. related genes, including mlg (P < 0.01), sIg (P < 0.05), AID (P < 0.01), PU.1 (P < 0.05) and Rag2 (P < 0.05) at d 3 and d 6 post injection, comparing to control. Collectively, this work indicates that overexpression of miR-155 suppresses the mRNA level of immune-related genes in CIK cells and zebrafish, and mlg is a novel target gene of miR-155 in fish. These findings provide an insight into the miR-155 modulating adaptive immunity in grass carp and zebrafish.

AB The Griewank function is a typical multimodal benchmark function, composed of a quadratic convex function and an oscillatory nonconvex function. The comparative importance of Griewank's two major parts alters in different dimensions. Different from most test functions, an unusual phenomenon appears when optimizing the Griewank function. The Griewank function first becomes more difficult and then becomes easier to optimize with the increase of dimension. In this study, from the methodology perspective, this phenomenon is explained by structural, mathematical, and quantum analyses. Furthermore, frequency transformation and amplitude transformation are implemented on the Griewank function to make a generalization. The multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) with quantum tunnel effect is used to verify its characteristics. Experimental results indicate that the Griewank function's two-scale structure is the main reason for this phenomenon. The quantum tunneling mechanism mentioned in this paper is an effective method which can be generalized to analyze the generation and variation of solutions for numerous swarm optimization algorithms.

Compared to reported oxidation methods, broader substrates scope and milder conditions were achieved in our method. Importantly, this oxidation method can afford N-sulfonyl enaminones using Mannich products as starting materials. Additionally, the one-pot Friedel-Crafts arylation reaction of unseparated N-sulfonylimine formed in our system with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene was successful without any additional catalyst.

AB Resistin (RETN) is a hormone secreted by adipocytes, which plays an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study is to clone and obtain the full length open reading frame (ORF) of goat RETN gene sequence, and to reveal its molecular and expression characteristics. Simultaneously, we explore its effect on the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes in goat. The full length ORF sequence of goat RETN gene was cloned by RT-PCR technique, and bioinformatics analysis was performed though relevant biological softwares. In this study, the expression of RETN mRNA in goat tissues and intramuscular preadipocytes during differentiation was detected by qPCR technique. Furthermore, RNA interference was used to explore the effects of RETN on intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation in goat. The results showed that the cloned goat RETN gene sequence was 428 bp in length, of which the ORF was 330 bp, encoding 109 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed that it had 12 phosphorylation sites and an O-glycosylation site, and its protein contained a signal peptide sequence. Also, the RETN gene is expressed in goat various analyzed tissues, and the results showed that the expression of RETN gene in lung tissue was higher than that in other analyzed tissues of goat (p < .01). Moreover, the expression level of RETN gene in the goat's intramuscular preadipocytes decreased first and then increased, and reached the highest on the fifth day, which was significantly higher than that of undifferentiated intramuscular preadipocytes (p < .001). After transfecting intramuscular preadipocyte with siRNA, we found that the mRNA level of RETN was significantly down-regulated by 70% and 87% (p < .01). Oil red O staining results showed that the interference of RETN gene can promote the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes. After knockdown of RETN with siRNA, the PPAR gamma, AP2, C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta and SREBP1 genes were significantly up-regulated (p < .01). Thus, it can be inferred that RETN inhibits the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes, probably through regulating the expression of C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, PPAR gamma, AP2 and SREBP-1 genes.

AB The present work describes a solution-free method for preparation of copper(I) iodide (CuI) particles on copper wire by dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The prepared material was applied to develop a colorimetric semi quantitative analysis for fast screening analysis of trace mercury (Hg) by combing mercury vapor generation with Hg/CuI chromogenic reaction. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was successfully explored for visual determination of trace Hg in natural water and certified reference samples, and the results were in good agreement with cold vapor generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVG-AFS). It was proved to be a green, fast, visual and portable method for the determination of trace Hg in these real samples. It is a potential field analytical method for fast screening analysis.

Furthermore, as an important reduced equation, the traveling wave equation is investigated in detail. Treating it as a singular perturbation system in R4, we apply the geometric singular perturbation theory and dynamical system methods to study its phase space geometry. By using some techniques, such as tracking the unstable manifold of the saddle, discussing transversality of the stable and unstable manifolds and investigating some complicated nonlocal bifurcation, we obtain wave speed conditions to guarantee the existence of various bounded traveling waves of the BKL equation.

AB Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are oxygen-dependent transcriptional activators, but there is little information about their role in yak (Bos grunniens) reproduction. The present study, for the first time, investigated the adaptive mechanism of yak reproduction to high-altitude hypoxic stress by comparing the expression of HIF mRNAs between female yaks at high-altitude and cattle at low-altitude. Hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, oviduct, ovary and uterus tissue samples were collected from five adult female yaks and cattle. mRNA expression was determined by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha were expressed in all five tissues examined from both species, albeit at different levels. In yaks, the highest mRNA levels of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha occurred in the oviduct and anterior pituitary, respectively. Both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha mRNA levels were higher in yaks than in cattle (p < 0.01). These data provide evidence that adaptation of reproduction to hypoxic conditions is associated with a greater expression of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in the reproductive axis of female yaks than cattle.

AB Some antioxidants and growth factors play an important role in promoting oocyte maturation and embryo development in many mammalian species, but there is little information about the yak (Bos grunniens). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate Cys, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermis growth factor (EGF) on yak oocyte maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rates after in vitro fertilized with Jersey sperm. A single or different combination of Cys, EGF and IGF-1 was added to in vitro maturation (IVM) and in vitro culture (IVC) media. The results showed that a single addition of Cys and IGF-1 increased oocyte maturation and blastocyst rates (p < .05), but did not increase cleavage rate; EGF or IGF-1 + EGF increased oocyte maturation, cleavage and blastocyst rates (p < .05) compared with the control. A combination of IGF-1 + EGF + Cys could have a beneficial effect (p < .05). These results indicated that supplementation of IVM and IVC media with Cys, IGF-1, EGF and their combinations could improve in vitro production efficiency of yak-cattle crossbred embryos.

AB .As a transition metal element, chromium (Cr) has attracted enormous attention for its promotion on stability and magnetic properties of aluminium (Al) based materials. However, the direct experimental evidence for determining the specific locations of transition metal dopants is a challenging issue in material science. Equilibrium geometries, stabilities, electronic and magnetic properties of AlnCr(n = 1-24) clusters were studied using the density functional theory. It was found that Cr dopants stabilized the Al clusters. And, they were located at surfaces of the clusters for small AlnCr(n = 1-16) clusters. Then, with cluster size increasing, Cr dopants transit to interiors of the clusters gradually. During the doping process, electrons transfer from Al(3s) to Cr(4p) orbitals. Besides, charge transfers of Al (3s) Al (3p) and Cr (4s) Cr (4p) were discovered within Al atoms and Cr atoms, respectively. Spin magnetic moments for most of these clusters were more than one B. The 3d electrons were found to be the primary reason for magnetism. This research would be helpful for studying transition metal doping in small metal clusters.

AB BackgroundEnteroviruses (Picornaviridae family) have been widely detected in the feces from cattle with diarrhea. However, the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenicity of enteroviruses in cattle remain unclear. Recently, we isolated a novel EV-F7 strain called SWUN-AB001 from diarrheal yak (Bos grunniens) feces. To explore the pathogenic mechanisms of this novel virus, we used a transcriptomics approach to find genes with differential expression patterns in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells during infection with SWUN-AB001 over time.ResultsMDBK cells were sampled at 12 and 24h post-infection (hpi) to represent the early and late stages of a SWUN-AB001 infection. Compared with the non-infected cells, 19 and 1050 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 and 24hpi, respectively. These DEGs were associated with disease, signal transduction, cellular process and cytokine signaling categories. At 24hpi, the pathway enrichment analysis revealed that signal pathways such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/ stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions were associated with the interactions occurring between EV-F7 and MDBK cells. Our additional western blot analysis showed that the phosphorylation levels of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK proteins increased significantly in the MDBK cells at 24hpi. The result indicated that infection with EV-F7 could activate JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK pathways in MDBK cells, and possibly trigger large-scale cytokine production.ConclusionOur transcriptome analysis provides useful initial data towards better understanding of the infection mechanisms used by EV-F7, while highlighting the potential molecular relationships occurring between the virus and the host's cellular components.

AB Asymmetric plate-type micro-channels (APM) have one hydrophobic wall and one hydrophilic wall. By flowing through APM, a kerosene-in-water emulsion can be de-emulsified in one second. To date, however, the demulsification process in the APM is still a black box. In order to observe the demulsification process directly, transparent asymmetric plate-type micro-channels (TAPM) were fabricated with two surface-modified glass plates. Emulsions with oil contents of 10%, 30%, and 50% were pumped through TAPM with heights of 39.2 m and 159.5 m. The movement and coalescence of oil droplets (the dispersed phase of a kerosene-in-water emulsion) in the TAPM were observed directly with an optical microscope. By analyzing videos and photographs, it was found that the demulsification process included three steps: oil droplets flowed against and were adsorbed on the hydrophobic wall, then oil droplets coalesced to form larger droplets, whereupon the oil phase was separated. The experimental results showed that the demulsification efficiency was approximately proportional to the oil content (30-50%) of the emulsions and increased when the micro-channel height was reduced.

The phase boundary of rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) has been formed in the composition range of 0.030 <= x <= 0.040. An optimal comprehensive performance (e.g., d (33) 470 +/- 10 pC/N, k (p) 0.50 +/- 0.02, T (C) 283 A degrees C, epsilon (r) 1950, tan delta 0.043, Strain 0.135%, and d (33)* 450 pm/V) is obtained in the ceramics with x = 0.035. Moreover, a relatively good component stability of piezoelectric properties (d (33) 402-470 pC/N, k (p) 0.485-0.524, Strain 0.133-0.135%, and d (33)* 443-450 pm/V) is gained in a broad component range from 0.030 to 0.045, which is benefited from the contribution of multiphase boundary (R-O-T, R-T). Therefore, we believe that KNNS-xBNNZ ceramics opens a window for the practical applications in piezoelectric material markets.

AB In our previous research, 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methyl-butanoic acid were identified as representative and specific volatile organic compounds released by Staphylococcus aureus in broth. In this study, we explored the production of the 2 volatiles and their correlation to Staph. aureus growth in milk under different conditions. We found significant correlations between the production of 3-methyl-butanoic acid and cell counts of 5 Staph. aureus strains in sterile milk, and there were no obvious differences for its production among 5 tested strains. The intensities of the 2 volatiles were similar and positively correlated with bacterial counts in cultures at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C despite delayed production of volatiles at 25 degrees C; however, neither compound could be detected at 4 degrees C. The production of 3-methyl-butanoic acid was strongly correlated with growth of Staph. aureus mixed with Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Shigella flexneri, whereas correlations for 3-methyl-butanal were not statistically significant. Compared with the monoculture of Staph. aureus, in mixed cultures, production of 3-methyl-butanal was decreased and that of 3-methylbutanoic acid was comparatively higher. In pasteurized and raw milks, production of 3-methyl-butanoic acid was correlated with growth of Staph. aureus, and 3-methyl-butanoic acid could be detected when Staph. aureus populations reached 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/mL in pasteurized milk and 10(5) to 10(6) cfu/mL in raw milk; the correlations for 3-methyl-butanal were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that 3-methyl-butanoic acid is a more suitable marker for high counts of Staph. aureus in milk, whereas 3-methyl-butanal is a transient metabolite and easily depressed by environmental factors.

AB Flowering plants interact simultaneously with mutualistic pollinators and antagonistic herbivores such that plant-mediated interactions between pollinators and herbivores must exist. Although the effects of herbivores on pollinator behavior have been investigated extensively, the effect of pollinators on herbivore performance has seldom been explored. We hypothesized that insect pollinators could improve the survival and growth of pre-dispersal seed predators by increasing seed production. We tested this hypothesis along three transects radiating from well-established apiaries in an alpine meadow by supplementing pollination in sites close to and distant from apiaries and subsequently examining seed production of the dominant nectariferous plant species Saussurea nigrescens (Asteraceae) and the performance of three dominant pre-dispersal seed predators (tephritid fly species). Pollen supplementation (1) significantly increased seed set and mass of developed seed per capitulum (i.e., flowerhead) in the distant but not the close sites, (2) did not change the survival and growth rates of the smaller-bodied species (Tephritis femoralis and Campiglossa nigricauda) at either site, but (3) improved the performance of the larger-bodied seed predator (Terellia megalopyge) at distant sites but not close sites. In addition, the larger-bodied tephritid fly showed higher infestation rates and relative abundance in the close sites than in the distant sites, whereas the smaller-bodied species had lower relative abundances in the close sites and similar infestation rates in both site types. These observations demonstrate contrasting effects of plant mutualists on the performance of antagonists with potential consequences for population sizes of insect herbivores.

AB Organoaluminum compounds are excellent nucleophiles for organic reactions because of their high reactivities, the high Lewis acidity of the aluminum center, and their low toxicities. Therefore, organoalanes are widely applied in cross-coupling reactions. In this paper, recent research results about the organoalummum reagents applied in cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by palladium are reviewed, involving various reaction systems.

AB Tibetan goat and Tibetan sheep are species peculiar to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau which is the highest plateau in the world, and have high hypoxia resistance to the extremely bad environment. Unlike monogastrics, how the genes change responding to hypoxia in ruminants remains unclear. In this study, three healthy animals of Tibetan sheep, Tibetan goat, Chuanzhong goat, and Small-tailed Han sheep were selected. The expression of factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FIH 1) hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), HIF-3 alpha, and erythropoietin (EPO) in various tissues, including heart, liver, lungs, kidney, muscle, and brain, was investigated. The EPO was observed highly expressed in all the tissues of Tibetan goats and Tibetan sheep compared with low-altitude animals, respectively, implied that higher expression of EPO may give the explanation for the hypoxia resistance of plateau animals. Besides, we also cloned the promoters of FIH-1, HIF-1 alpha, HIF-3 alpha, and EPO in goats and sheep, analyzed their core regions and CpG islands. Higher methylation rate was observed in HIF-1 alpha, HIF-3 alpha, and EPO, whereas lower methylation rate hit on FIH-1. These data may be beneficial for revealing the response mechanism to hypoxia of plateau animals.

DT Review
DE Chinese herbal medicine; newborns; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy;

AB Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Xingnaojing Injection for newborns with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Methods: Literatures were identified by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central, and four Chinese literature databases from the establishment of database to October in 2013. Relevant reference lists were also screened. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of included studies. We also conducted the meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen trials involving 1,169 patients were included. There was no trial reported death or disability at the end of follow-up period. Meta-analysis of 4 trials (n=371) showed that there was no significant difference in the reduction of mortality [risk ratios (RR)=0.48, 95% confidence intervals (CI, 0.21, 1.13), P=0.09] between the Xingnaojing and control groups. Meta-analysis of 5 trials (n=359) showed that there was significant difference in reducing the major neurodevelopmental disability [RR=0.36, 95% CI (0.19, 0.66), P=0.001]. Meta-analysis of 6 trials (n=447) showed that there was significant difference in the author self-defined symptom improvement [RR=1.25, 95% CI (1.14, 1.37), P < 0.01]. No fatal side-effects were reported. Conclusion: Based on the limited evidence, the routine use of Xingnaojing Injection for treatment of HIE in newborns is not recommended. Further well-conducted trials are justified.

AB The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the growth performance, chemical composition, and functional amino acids (FAA) composition of two crossing systems between wild boars and different domesticated pig breeds. Forty castrated male pigs at 60 days of age from 3 breeds including Wild boar (W), Bamei (B) and Yorkshire (Y) and their crossing systems Wild boar x Bamei (W x B) and Wild boar x Yorkshire (W x Y) were assigned into five groups, respectively. After 100 days of feeding, the growth performance, chemical composition and amino acids (AA) in longissimus muscle were analysed. The ADG (P < .01) in W was lower than other breeds (B and Y) and their crossing systems (W x B and Wx Y) (P < .01). The content of intramuscular fat (IMF) was decreased (P < .01) in W when compared with other breeds (B and Y) and their crossing systems (W x B and Wx Y) (P < .01). In terms of the levels of FAA, leucine in W was lower than those of the other breeds (B and Y) or their crossing systems (W x B and Wx Y) (P < .01), whereas the levels of proline, cysteine, glutamate, total FAA, total AA, and total FAA/total AA was the highest in the Wild boar (P < .01). Herein, cross breeding with domesticated pigs was shown to be an effective method to improve the growth performance of wild boars, and the extent of improvement was breed dependent. Compared with domesticated pigs and cross-bred pigs, wild boars showed lower growth rate, but lower IMF and better FAA composition in longissimus muscle.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effect of vitrification on survival rate and cytoskeleton gene expression during yak oocyte maturation. The yak oocytes were incubated for 0h [germinal vesicle (GV) stage] and in vitro matured for 24h [metaphase II (MII) stage] to obtain immature and mature oocytes. Survival rate after vitrification were compared between immature and mature yak oocytes and cytoskeleton-related genes [cytokeratin 8 (CK8), -actin (ACTB), and gap junction protein, alpha 1 (GJA1)] were tested by real-time PCR. Our results showed that MII stage survival rate after open pulled straw vitrification (35.60%) is significantly higher than GV stage (25.90%) oocytes. Furthermore, expression of CK8, ACTB, and GJA1 in MII stage oocytes are also significantly higher than GV stage oocytes. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that higher expression of GJA1, CK8, and ACTB in vitrify-warmed MII stage oocytes when compared with GV stage oocytes and such discrepancy might result in higher survival rate in vitrify-warmed MII stage oocytes.

AB The fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) plays an important role in trans-membrane uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and has been identified and described in many organisms, while little is known about this gene in freshwater fish, and especially in the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). In this study, the uptake of LCFA in hepatocytes of C. idellus was firstly determined and then FAT/CD36 gene was cloned; then the gene was sequenced and mRNA levels from different tissues and the effect of dietary oils on its expression were determined. Present data showed that trans-membrane absorption of LCFA was related to the type and concentration of fatty acids (FAs) and it could be inhibited by specific membrane uptake inhibitors. The FAT/CD36 isolated from grass carp contained 1422 bp and the open reading frame was predicted to have 1403 bp (GenBank access number: KU361231.1). FAT/ CD36 was highly expressed in the brain and its lowest expression was in the gills. FAT/CD36 expression in white muscle was up-regulated when fish were fed with groundnut oil, whereas it was downregulated in fish fed fish and linseed oils, respectively. These results indicated n-3 PUFA might inhibit the FAT/CD36 mRNA expression and therefore the oxidation of FAs.

AB Azides obtained from Baylis-Hillman adducts were treated with triphenylphosphine to give the corresponding iminophosphoranes, which reacted with carbon disulfide at 40 degrees C to produce isothiocyanates. The reaction of these isothiocyanates with primary amines provided thiourea intermediates, which in the presence of potassium carbonate or sodium methoxide were converted into 2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-4(1H)-ones in good yields.

AB The low-temperature rapid solid phase crystallization route of amorphous silicon is fundamentally and technologically significant. Micrometer thick hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films were exposed to a low-frequency inductively coupled hydrogen plasma under a low substrate temperature of 300 degrees C. The plasma treated a-Si: H was completely crystallized within half an hour. The evolution of microstructures, optical and electric properties with respect to plasma exposure duration deterministically demonstrates that the present low-temperature rapid crystallization process enables the controllable phase transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline (nc) silicon. The crystallization mechanism is discussed in terms of the unique characteristics of low-frequency inductively coupled plasma (LFICP) and the LFICP-grown precursor a-Si: H film itself. The crucial role of hydrogen atoms in the phase transition is also discussed.

AB The IgtF gene encodes a glucosyltransferase responsible for adding a glucose to the first sugar of heptose I in the synthesis of lipooligosaccharides (LOS). To study the function of IgtF, we constructed an IgtF mutant (Delta lgtF) from Haemophilus parasuis SC096 using a natural transformation system. A highly purified preparation of LOS from Delta lgtF (Delta lgtF-LOS) exhibited an obvious truncation in structure compared to the LOS of the wild-type SC096 strain (WT-LOS). The Delta lgtF-LOS also displayed a significantly reduced ability to induce inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in comparison with the WT-LOS. Furthermore, we also found that Delta lgtF-LOS-treated cells had significantly decreased phospho-p65 and phospho-p38, and inhibited I kappa B alpha degradation. These findings suggested that the lgtF gene mediated LOS induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PAMs by regulating the NF-kappa B and MAPKs signaling pathways during H. parasuis infection.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the association between age at symptom onset and action cancelation in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Performance on the stop-signal task was compared among adult patients with early-onset OCD (n=63, onset age <= 19), late-onset OCD (n=33, onset age >= 20), and healthy controls (n=51). Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) was significantly longer in both OCD groups compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were found between the two OCD groups. In addition, age at symptom onset was not associated with response inhibition performance in adults with OCD. The study findings support the existence of reduced performance on action cancelation in patients with OCD compared to healthy controls with no difference between early- and late-onset OCD subtypes.

AB Wavelengths, transition probabilities, and oscillator strengths have been calculated for M-shell electric dipole (E1) transitions in Al-like W61+ through Cl-like W57+, with partially filled 3p subshell. The fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method, taking quantum electrodynamical effect and Breit correction into account, was used in the calculations. Calculated energy levels of M-shell excited states in Al-like through Cl-like W ions from the method were compared with some available theoretical and experimental results, and good agreement with them was achieved.

AB A facile yet efficient strategy was proposed by means of a combination of ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry with multivariate calibration methods, through which 1,2-dinitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,4-dinitrobenzene in water samples could be simultaneously determined without any pre-separation process. The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling combined with successive projections algorithm (CARS SPA) approach was used to diminish uninformative variables and select the important ones from spectral data measured. The multivariate calibration models were constructed by partial least squares (PLS-1) regression with high accuracy, in which the coefficients of determination of prediction (R-pred(2)) were 0.9935, 0.9969, and 0.9971 and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were 0.7850, 0.5411 and 0.5414 for 1,2-dinitrobenzene, 1,3-dinitrobenzene and 1,4-dinitrobenzene, respectively. The optimized model was successfully applied to simultaneously determine the content of the three studied analytes in several real water samples with good recovery close to 100%. Finally, the elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) tests further confirm that the proposed method has no proportional and constant error in the predicted concentrations, providing a statistic support for the accuracy of the model. These results indicate that it is promise for UV spectroscopy coupled to the multivariate calibration technique to establish a simple, quick, accurate and reliable analysis method for simultaneous determination of some nitroaromatic compounds in real environments. Also, the strategy proposed by the work will advance the analytical methods used in the other complicated sample systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION; IMPROVEMENT
AB The Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) has brought us a lot of conveniences. However, it may also reveal patients' privacies and other important information. So the security of TMIS can be paid much attention to, in which identity authentication plays a very important role in protecting TMIS from being illegally used. To improve the situation, TMIS needs a more secure and more efficient authentication scheme. Recently, Yan and Li et al. have proposed a secure authentication scheme for the TMIS based on biometrics, claiming that it can withstand various attacks. In this paper, we present several security problems in their scheme as follows: (a) it cannot really achieve three-factor authentication; (b) it has design flaws at the password change phase; (c) users' biometric may be locked out; (d) it fails to achieve users' anonymous identity. To solve these problems, a new scheme using the theory of Secure Sketch is proposed. The thorough analysis shows that our scheme can provide a stronger security than Yan-Li's protocol, despite the little higher computation cost at client. What's more, the proposed scheme not only can achieve anonymity preserving but also can achieve session key agreement.

AB Compared with conventional heating, microwave heating is one of the most useful tools in organic synthesis because of its obviously advantages of fast heating, thermal efficiency, saving energy, clean, and easy operation. Palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction could tolerate a broad range of functional groups with high stereoselectivity to provide a mild method in preparation of kinds of substituted biaryls. In this paper, the recent research results about the microwave technique applied in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction are reviewed, involving various reaction systems. The applications of the methodology on the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules have also been introduced.

AB We herein report a method for the imaging of different inclusion abilities of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) toward cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) using liquid crystals (LCs). The optical transition from the dark to the bright state was caused by the inclusion interaction between CTAB and CDs. It was confirmed that alpha-CD formed more stable CTAB complexes than beta-CD, leading to different optical responses of the LCs from the alpha-CDICTAB and beta-CDICTAB systems. This method could be used to provide a visual method for selection of the correct CD molecules for interaction with surfactant molecules in recognition systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An analysis of the O 1s peak of ZnO film showed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies increases with the Co doping level. We also revealed that the introduction of Co ions causes the valence state of Cu to change from +2 to +1 as the Co concentration level exceeds 1%.

AB This paper investigates the infinite and finite time ruin probability under the condition that the company is allowed to invest a certain amount of money in some stock market, and the remaining reserve in the bond with constant interest force. The total insurance claim amount is modeled by a compound Poisson process and the price of the risky asset follows a general exponential Levy process. Exponential type upper bounds for the ultimate ruin probability are derived when the investment is a fixed constant, which can be calculated explicitly. This constant investment strategy yields the optimal asymptotic decay of the ruin probability under some mild assumptions. Finally, we provide an approximation of the optimal investment strategy, which maximizes the expected wealth of the insurance company under a risk constraint on the Value-at-Risk.

AB Acanthopanax is a widely ingested vegetable in China, but its elemental composition has not yet been characterized. Essential and toxic elemental concentrations in Acanthopanax were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), including Al, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Si, Sr, Ti, V, Pb, and Zn. The concentration data were analyzed by chemometric approaches: correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis. The essential elemental concentrations suggest that Acanthopanax may be a suitable source of these nutrients. The chemometric results demonstrate the varieties and ages had meaningful influence on the elemental patterns of Acanthopanax. Storage and processing did not significantly affect the element concentrations except when pickled.

AB Argentina anserina (Rosaceae), a perennial herb, forms enlarged tuberous roots (commonly referred to as "ginseng fruit") exclusively in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, making it a unique medicinal and edible plant resource in this region. The upper reaches of the Dadu River and Minjiang River are one of its primary production areas in China. This study employs an ensemble model to simulate the potential distribution of A. anserina in this region, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, ecological niche, and centroid migration patterns. Additionally, a cultivation productivity evaluation model integrating ecological suitability and nutritional components was developed to delineate potential cultivation areas. Results indicate that high-suitability habitats span 0.37 x 104 km2 (7.39% of the total suitable area), exhibiting a patchy and fragmented distribution in Aba County, Rangtang County, Jiuzhi County, and Banma County. Core cultivation areas cover 3.78 x 104 km2, distributed across Aba County, Rangtang County, Jiuzhi County, Seda County, Banma County, Hongyuan County, and Markam City. Under future climate scenarios, the suitable distribution area of A. anserina will gradually decline with rising temperatures, migrating to higher-latitude northern regions, accompanied by increased niche migration. By the 2090s under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the centroid demonstrates the largest migration amplitude, with high-suitability habitats showing a "collapsing" polarization pattern and near-complete niche separation from the previous period, indicating significant changes. Collectively, these results provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable utilization of A. anserina in the upper Dadu River and Minjiang River basin.

AB Digital countryside is the strategic direction of rural revitalization, and it is also a new driving force to promote the resilience of county economy. Based on the panel data of counties from 2013 to 2022, this paper constructs an index of regional economic resilience by using entropy weight method, and establishes an econometric model. From the perspective of financial development, this paper discusses the impact of digital rural construction on regional economic resilience, and further analyzes the regional heterogeneity of the effect. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The construction of digital countryside can significantly improve the resilience of county economy, and the impact is still stable after a series of tests; (2) Digital village construction can improve the resilience of county economy by promoting the level of regional financial development; (3) The impact of the construction of digital countryside on the resilience of county economy is characterized by regional heterogeneity, and has different impacts on the eastern, central and western regions and regions with different administrative levels. Based on this, the paper puts forward policy suggestions in three aspects: strengthening the construction of rural digital infrastructure, deepening the structural reform of the financial supply side, and implementing differentiated policy promotion mechanisms, providing policy inspiration for promoting the resilience of regional economy.

AB Climate warming has profound effects on terrestrial ecosystems, with biodiversity playing a crucial role in modulating ecosystem productivity responses. While extensive studies have investigated how plant species richness (alpha-diversity) influences aboveground productivity under warming conditions, the contributions of plant and soil microbial beta-diversity to belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a 6-year warming experiment in an alpine meadow to investigate the response patterns and drivers of BNPP, as well as the alpha- and beta-diversity of plant and soil microbial communities. Our results showed that warming increased BNPP by 41.41%-90.3%, with biodiversity metrics collectively accounting for about 86% of the variation in BNPP. Notably, while climate warming significantly reduced the alpha-diversity of both plant (p = 0.067) and soil bacterial communities (p < 0.05), soil bacterial beta-diversity showed a marked increase. The enhancement in soil bacterial beta-diversity was closely linked to increased gene abundance associated with ammonification and nitrification processes, identified as key drivers of BNPP under warming conditions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of soil microbial beta-diversity in supporting BNPP under warming conditions. Our study highlights the need to preserve belowground microbial heterogeneity to maintain ecosystem functioning and enhance carbon sequestration efforts in the face of global climate change.

AB 1. Plant nutrient-acquisition strategies (NAS) linking soil nutrients to plant growth are considered crucial to species replacement during primary succession. However, empirical evidence from field studies remains scarce. 2. We examined the replacement of Hippophae tibetana (Elaeagnaceae) by Populus purdomii (Salicaceae) during the first three stages (S1-S3) of succession along the Hailuogou postglacial chronosequence in southwest China. We investigated changes in the scavenging, mining and N-2-fixing strategies of the two species with varying soil nutrient levels and evaluated how these NAS influenced plant performance with succession. 3. Bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations increased significantly from near detection limits at the S1 stage to 60 and 41 mg kg(-1) at the S3 stage, respectively. Despite this, H. tibetana maintained mining and N-2-fixing strategies, as indicated by rhizothamnia, cluster roots and lower pH, and higher carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activities in soil surrounding roots compared with those around P. purdomii at all sites. Conversely, P. purdomii relied on scavenging strategies, evidenced by higher ectomycorrhizal colonization and specific root length, smaller root diameter and more negative leaf delta C-13 than those of H. tibetana. Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, along with the relative abundance of H. tibetana, were significantly higher than those of P. purdomii at S1, but this reversed at S3. Linear mixed models indicated that mining and N-2-fixing strategies were positively correlated with nutrient concentrations at low soil nutrient levels, while scavenging strategies can enhance leaf nutrients at relatively high soil nutrient levels. Linear regression models showed that leaf nitrogen and phosphorus accounted for 13% and 31% of variation in relative abundance, respectively. The residuals of these models were further reduced by 35% and 39% when accounting for the combined effects of mining and N-2-fixing strategies. Results from incubation experiments, functional gene abundance and enzymatic activities showed that microbial nitrogen mineralization and phosphorus solubilization were similar in the rhizosphere of both species. 4. Synthesis. Distinct investments and changing efficiency of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies (NAS) in response to soil nutrient availability are key drivers of species turnover during primary succession. These findings underscore the importance of belowground plant NAS mechanisms in shaping aboveground community dynamics during early pedogenesis.

AB Milk is a rich source of probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which have been shown to promote gut health, support the immune system, enhance digestion, and prevent pathogen colonization. This study aimed to isolate and identify LAB strains from giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) milk, evaluate their probiotic properties, and analyze the genomic characteristics of a promising strain. Thirteen LAB strains were isolated from 12 samples of giant panda milk. Among all LAB strains, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PM8 (PM8) demonstrated probiotic properties and safety features. It exhibited strong growth performance, high antipathogenic activity against four pathogens, and strong survival rates under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. PM8 also showed excellent adhesion capabilities to Caco-2 cells. Additionally, safety assessment revealed no hemolysin production and minimal antibiotic resistance, making it a promising candidate for probiotic applications. The genome of PM8 consists of 3,227,035 bp with a GC content of 44.60% and contains 3171 coding sequences, including 113 carbohydrate-active enzyme genes and genes related to exopolysaccharides synthesis, vitamin B biosynthesis, adhesion, antioxidant activity, and bile salt hydrolysis. Notably, it contains genes involved in nonribosomally synthesized secondary metabolite and bacteriocin production. The genomic safety analysis confirmed that PM8 lacks the capacity to transmit bacterial antimicrobial resistance and is non-pathogenic to both humans and animals. These findings suggest that PM8 holds considerable potential for enhancing gut health and supporting the development of safe probiotic products.

AB With recent electronic devices relying on sub-nanometer features, the understanding of device performance requires a direct probe of the atomic arrangement. As an ideal tool for crystallographic analysis at the nanoscale, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (ACTEM) has the ability to provide atomically resolved images and core-loss spectra. Herein, the techniques for crystallographic structure analysis based on ACTEM are reviewed and discussed, particularly ACTEM techniques for measuring strain, dislocations, phase transition, and lattice in-plane misorientation. In situ observations of crystal evolution during the application of external forces or electrical fields are also introduced, so a correlation between crystal quality and device performance can be obtained.

AB Solar-driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) offers significant potential for water treatment, particularly in desalination. Currently, there is increasing interest in designing highly efficient, recyclable, and environmentally sustainable evaporators. In this study, fresh loofah, a natural green plant with an anisotropic structure in its outer skin and inner flesh, was carbonized to fabricate an all-in-one evaporator. Through freeze-drying and hightemperature carbonization, the outer loofah skin formed a wall-like structure that helps maintain shape and structure integrity, protecting the inner layer. The contracted inner loofah layer exhibited a porous structure, promoting directional water transport and efficient evaporation. Specifically, the carbonized loofah achieved an evaporation rate of 1.732 kg m- 2 h- 1 under 1 sun irradiation for deionized water and 1.658 kg m- 2 h- 1 for a salt solution. Additionally, the carbonized loofah demonstrated good salt tolerance, reusability, excellent metal ion and organic pollutant removal, and practical applicability. These features highlight a novel design that leverages the natural wall-like structure of a carbonized loofah to enhance stability, making it an efficient all-in-one solardriven interfacial evaporator.

AB In China, the policy of tax enforcement digitalization has been introduced with the implementation of the CTAIS-3 project. In this policy context, we study the impact of tax enforcement digitization on corporate digital transformation (CDTM) from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our results suggest that the introduction of tax enforcement digitalization inhibits CDTM, and further mechanism investigation indicates that this impact is realized through two channels: increasing the tax burden on firms and reducing firms' risk preference. Heterogeneity analysis shows that at the provincial level, the negative impact of tax enforcement digitalization on CDTM is greater in provinces with greater fiscal pressure and worse marketization level. At the firm level, the negative effect of tax enforcement digitalization on CDTM is more significant for firms with lower levels of governance and firms with greater fiscal constraints. In addition, we find that the CTAIS-3 project does help governments to provide more subsidies to innovative firms, but does not further reduce or improve CDTM. Our study reveals the potential economic consequences of the implementation of tax enforcement digitalization policies at the micro-firm level, which provides a useful reference for future tax reforms in developing countries.

AB Alpine medicinal plant growth, physiological processes and final number of metabolites are affected by elevation, demonstrating phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, in-depth understanding the alpine medicinal plant behaviors in responding to shift elevation has actually implications for resources protection, sustainable utilization and domestication cultivation. Currently, lots of literature detailly studied the effect of environmental factors on the synthesis and metabolism of second metabolisms in medicinal plants while the responding results of phenotype and metabolism to constrain environmental still lack systematic classification and summary. Hence, basing on previous works and literature, the adjustment of morphology and metabolism of alpine medicinal plants in responding of shift elevation were systematically outlined. The results of this reviews can know how the alpine plant adapting to shift elevation through physiological, metabolic and morphological adaptation. And this knowledge can be integrated into a framework for domesticating and protecting alpine medicinal plants, and can also serve as a quick tool to study the effects of climate warming on plateau medicinal plants.

The aroma of fermented sausages depends on the metabolic activities of microbiota, mainly involving lactic acid bacteria and catalase-positive cocci, the group of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in particular. Regarding staphylococci, this work elucidated their generation of aroma precursors from hydrolase, metabolic activities contributing to aroma development, antioxidant effects that improve aroma via preventing excessive lipid oxidation. The metabolic pathways of staphylococci that play a role in aroma formation involve carbohydrate fermentation, amino acid degradation, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and esterase activities. Their antioxidant activities are associated with superoxidase dismutase and catalase activities, as well as the production of antioxidant peptides. Processing conditions may influence CNS communities and affect aroma characteristics of fermented sausages. Implementation of genome sequencing and editing to select and customize CNS with specific biosynthetic metabolic pathways was proposed forward, offering a great potential for enhancing aroma development during sausage fermentation.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with morbidity and mortality ranking third and second among all cancers, respectively. As a result of a sequence of genetic and DNA methylation alterations that gradually accumulate in the healthy colonic epithelium, colorectal adenomas and invasive adenocarcinomas eventually give rise to CRC. Global hypomethylation and promoter-specific DNA methylation are characteristics of CRC. The pathophysiological role of aberrant DNA methylation in malignant tumors has garnered significant interest in the last few decades. In addition, DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in influencing immune cell function and tumor immune evasion. This review summarizes the most recent research on DNA methylation changes in CRC, including the role of DNA methylation-related enzymes in CRC tumorigenesis and biomarkers for diagnosis, predictive and prognostic. Besides, we focus on the emerging potential of epigenetic interventions to enhance antitumor immune responses and improve the CRC clinical practice.

AB Manganese (Mn), a plant micronutrient element, is an important component of metalloprotein involved in multiple metabolic processes, such as photosynthesis and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Its disorder (deficiency or excess) affects the Mn-dependent metabolic processes and subsequent growth and development of plants. The beneficial element of Si has a variety of applications in agricultural fields for plant adaptation to various environmental stresses, including Mn disorder. The probable mechanisms for Si alleviation of Mn toxicity in plants are summarized as follows: (1) Si alters the rhizosphere acidification, root exudates and microorganisms to decrease the bioavailability of Mn in the rhizosphere; (2) Si down-regulates Mn transporter gene and reinforces the apoplastic barriers for inhibiting the Mn uptake and translocation; and (3) Si promotes the Mn deposition onto cell wall and Mn compartmentation into vacuole. Under Mn-deficient conditions, the probable mechanisms for Si promotion of Mn absorption in some plants remain an open question. Moreover, scavenging ROS is a common mechanism for Si alleviating Mn disorder. This minireview highlights the current understanding and future perspectives of Si regulation of manganese homeostasis in plants.

AB Introduction Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive bacteria that produce lactic acid during fermentation, with some strains enhancing host health by modulating the gut microbiota, boosting immune responses, and reducing inflammation.Methods In this study, 6 LAB strains were isolated from two dog milk samples, and their probiotic properties were comprehensively evaluated. The evaluation included growth properties, stress resistance, antipathogen activity, adhesion activity, safety assessment, antioxidant capacity, and prebiotic metabolites assessment.Results In comparison to the control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG, all 6 LAB isolates exhibited favorable probiotic properties. Additionally, the results of the antioxidant tests indicated that these strains demonstrated high tolerance to 0.5 mmol/L H2O2 and exhibited significant scavenging abilities for the free radicals 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine (DPPH) and hydroxyl (OH-). Furthermore, the 6 LAB isolates were found to produce elevated concentrations of prebiotic metabolites, including exopolysaccharides (EPS), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and bile salt hydrolase (BSH).Discussion This study presents a comprehensive analysis of LAB isolates derived from canine milk. These isolates exhibited multifunctional properties, with strain L221 performing the best overall, making it a promising candidate for probiotic use in dogs.

AB Necrotic enteritis (NE), caused by Clostridium perfringens, represents a major economic challenge to poultry production. This study evaluated the effects of four plant extracts-Astragalus, pomegranate peel, Sophora flavescens, and Artemisia annua-in combination with B. subtilis, as potential antibiotic alternatives for controlling NE. Using an experimentally induced NE model produced by coinfection with Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens, 288 chickens were divided into 12 groups to assess growth performance, intestinal lesions, and inflammatory markers. Compared with the enramycin group, the pomegranate peel extract group had a 9.9% increase in body weight gain (BWG), significant enhancement in claudin-2 expression, and reduced production of inflammatory factors. Compared with the infected control group, the combination of A. annua extract and B. subtilis resulted in the lowest intestinal lesion scores. The claudin-2, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 expression levels in the group treated with S. flavescens extract combined with B. subtilis increased to the highest levels compared to those in the healthy control group. These findings emphasize the potential of plant extracts, particularly pomegranate peel and A. annua with B. subtilis, as natural alternatives for NE management in poultry, providing a promising approach to reducing reliance on antibiotics.

AB The presence of rare earth elements (REEs) has a certain inhibitory effect on microorganisms, making the biological treatment of REEs wastewater an area of ongoing research and exploration. In this study, a vertical architecture anaerobic process and transition metal catalyzed bioelectromembrane reactor (IVABEMR) were integrated to continuously treat REEs, enhancing the potential for efficient treatment and recovery analysis. The IVABEMR demonstrated exceptional performance in removing La(III), Ce(III), Y(III), Eu(III) and Tb(III), the highest removal efficiency can reach 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.9%, 99.9%, 100%. Removal efficiency was enhanced by an electroactive electrode membrane driven by autogenous bioelectricity. Feature analysis revealed that selfreleased electroflocculated nucleus, recycling electromembrane reduction, and activated sludge had significant impacts on the decontamination outcomes of REEs. Functional microorganisms including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes at phylum level survived at high abundance in the process, establishing an adaptive and stable relationship. This study provides technological optimization for efficient biological treatment, has the advantages of environmental protection and economy, and provides a feasible idea for the treatment of REEs wastewater.

AB BACKGROUND: Fungal diseases present a significant threat to global agriculture, necessitating the development of new, safe, and effective fungicides. Existing fungicides face resistance and health risks, prompting the synthesis of novel compounds. Researchers have synthesized aldehyde-based thiourea and thiazolyl hydrazine derivatives, evaluating their antifungal activities to identify impactful pesticide molecules. RESULTS: The results showed that most of the compounds had broad-spectrum antifungal activity against six plant pathogenic fungi and four post-harvest fungi. Notably, compound LN18 showed the best antifungal activity against Monilinia fructicola with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.17 mu g mL(-1), which was better than the commercial fungicide natamycin. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study showed that the presence of unsaturated double bonds in the structure and the length of the carbon chain were the main factors affecting antifungal activity. The presence of unsaturated double bonds and an increase in the length of the carbon chain greatly improved inhibitory activity against the tested pathogens. The preliminary mechanism study showed that LN18 could damage the integrity of the mycelial plasma membrane, leading to leakage of intracellular nucleic acid and protein. LN18 also induced an increase in the intracellular reactive oxygen species level to exert its antifungal effects. In addition, compound LN18 had a stronger antifungal effect in vivo, and better phytotoxicity than natamycin, indicating broad application prospects in agriculture. CONCLUSION: Aldehydes-thiourea and thiazolyl hydrazine derivatives demonstrate remarkable antifungal efficacy against plant pathogenic and post-harvest fungi, offering a promising avenue for commercialization as highly efficacious, cost-effective and safe antifungal agents.

AB BackgroundMelanin in the black-bone chicken's body is considered the material basis for its medicinal effects and is an economically important trait. Therefore, improving the melanin content is a crucial focus in the breeding process of black-bone chickens. Luning chickens are black-bone chickens, with black beaks, skin, and meat. To investigate the genetic diversity and molecular mechanisms of melanin deposition in Luning chickens, we conducted whole-genome resequencing to analyze their breeding history and identify candidate genes influencing their black phenotype, along with transcriptome sequencing of dorsal skin tissues of male Luning chickens.ResultsPopulation structure analysis revealed that Luning chickens tend to cluster independently and are closely related to Tibetan chickens. Runs of homozygosity analysis suggested potential inbreeding in the Luning chicken and Tibetan chicken population. By combining genetic differentiation index (Fst) and nucleotide diversity (theta pi) ratios, we pinpointed selected regions associated with melanin deposition. Gene annotation identified 540 genes with the highest Fst value in LOC101750371 and LOC121108313, located on the 68.24-68.58 Mb interval of chromosome Z. Combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we identified ATP5E, EDN3, and LOC101750371 as candidate genes influencing skin color traits in black-bone chickens.ConclusionsThis study characterized the evolutionary history of Luning chickens and preliminarily excavated candidate genes influencing the genetic mechanism of pigmentation in black-bone chickens, providing valuable insights for the study of animal melanin deposition.

AB Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) is a natural polyphenolic compound, which plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of GSPE supplementation on the cholesterol metabolism and antioxidant status of finishing pigs. In longissimus dorse (LD) muscle, the data showed that GSPE significantly decreased the contents of total cholesterol (T-CHO) and triglyceride (TG), and decreased the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) and Fatty acid synthase (FAS), while increased the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1b (CPT1b), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR alpha) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). GSPE also reduced the enzyme activities of HMG-CoAR and FAS, and meanwhile amplified the activity of CPT1b in LD muscle of finishing pigs. Furthermore, dietary GSPE supplementation increased the serum catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), serum and liver total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels, while reduced serum and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) level in finishing pigs. In the liver, Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), Nuclear Factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) mRNA levels were increased by GSPE. In conclusion, this study showed that GSPE might be an effective dietary supplement for improving cholesterol metabolism and antioxidant status in finishing pigs.

AB With the increasing shortage of water resources and the aggravation of water pollution, solar-driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) technology has garnered considerable attention because of its low energy consumption, simple operation, and environmental friendliness. The popular multi-layer SISG evaporator is composed of two basic structures: a photothermal layer and a support layer. Herein, the support layer underlies the photothermal layer and carries out thermal management, supports the photothermal layer, and transports water to the evaporation interface to improve the stability of the evaporator. While most research focuses on the photothermal layer, the support layer is typically viewed as a supporting object for the photothermal layer. This review focuses on the support layer, which is relatively neglected in evaporator development. It summarizes existing progress in the field of multi-layer interface evaporators, based on various polymers and biomaterials, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Specifically, mainly polymer-based support layers are reviewed, including polymer foams, gels, and their corresponding functional materials, while biomaterial support layers, including natural plants, carbonized biomaterials, and other innovation biomaterials are not. Additionally, the corresponding structure design strategies for the support layer were also involved. It was found that the selection and optimal design of the substrate also played an important role in the efficient operation of the whole steam generation system. Their evolution and refinement are vital for advancing the sustainability and effectiveness of interfacial evaporation technology. The corresponding potential future research direction and application prospects of support layer materials are carefully presented to enable effective responses to global water challenges.

AB Extreme drought and intensification of land use pose substantial threats to ecosystem stability. However, existing studies that assess ecosystem stability focus primarily on the stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), while the stability of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) is often not considered. Here, we examined the response patterns and drivers of ANPP stability and BNPP stability in an alpine meadow to drought and clipping (simulating grazing and mowing) by the implementation of five levels of simulated precipitation (1/12, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and ambient precipitation) and clipping (unclipped vs. clipped) treatments over 7 years (2016-2022). The results showed that extreme drought decreased ANPP stability, while moderate drought increased BNPP stability and net primary productivity stability. The findings highlight the importance of jointly considering above- and belowground processes when evaluating ecosystem stability. Moreover, clipping did not have an impact on ANPP stability but reduced BNPP stability, and clipping differentially affected the stability of ANPP and BNPP in response to extreme drought. Furthermore, ANPP stability was largely determined by species temporal asynchrony rather than richness, whereas dominant species stability strongly contributed to the variation in BNPP stability of this alpine meadow faced with drought and clipping. Synthesis: In general, these results provide experimental evidence for the decoupling of the responses of above- and belowground productivity stability to extreme drought and clipping. Our findings indicate that aboveground responses should not be used as the sole indicator of the whole ecosystem consequences of extreme drought and disturbance factors such as grazing or mowing, emphasizing the need to evaluate ecosystem stability from a whole ecosystem perspective.
   This study provides experimental evidence for the decoupling of the responses of above- and belowground productivity stability to extreme drought and clipping. And the mechanisms underlying ANPP stability responses to extreme drought and clipping differed from those of BNPP stability. These findings emphasize the need to evaluate ecosystem stability from a whole ecosystem perspective.image

AB The complex composition of braised pork, including lean meat, pigskin, and fat, makes it difficult for sensory evaluation of its texture properties. This study investigated the correlation between sensory texture attributes and physicochemical properties to achieve an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the texture of braised pork. Sensory analysis demonstrated that the overall texture acceptability of braised pork was significantly and negatively influenced by sensory texture attributes (including sensory hardness, chewiness, and toughness), while it was positively impacted by sensory adhesiveness, softness, and juiciness. Shear force and texture profile analysis (TPA) variables, reflecting mastication behavior, were used to characterize the textural properties of braised pork. They were closely related to water distribution, with a higher proportion of immobilized water (P21), indicating a higher water holding capacity and a more tender texture. Correlation analysis between sensory texture attributes and physicochemical properties through partial least squares regression further revealed significant associations between shear force, TPA variables, and sensory texture attributes. Moreover, the proportion of immobilized water (P21) significantly and negatively affected sensory hardness and chewiness, whereas the proportion of free water (P22) significantly influenced sensory toughness. Sensory texture attributes could be well predicted by the physicochemical properties by projecting test samples onto calibration models established by known samples. Therefore, a combination of sensory and instrumental measures can reliably reflect the texture properties of braised pork.Practical ApplicationThe combination of sensory and instrumental methods is an effective strategy to accurately and objectively evaluate the texture properties of braised pork, which overcomes the limitations caused by the complexity of the composition and texture traits of braised pork. The accurate evaluation and standardization of texture properties is an important premise for the repeatable and stable cooking of traditional braised pork. Furthermore, this research method and findings can also be applied to guide the procedural optimization of smart appliances (e.g., induction cookers) for cooking braised pork.

AB In mammals, the transition from mitosis to meiosis facilitates the successful production of gametes. However, the regulatory mechanisms that control meiotic initiation remain unclear, particularly in the context of complex histone modifications. Herein, we show that KDM2A, acting as a lysine demethylase targeting H3K36me3 in male germ cells, plays an essential role in modulating meiotic entry and progression. Conditional deletion of Kdm2a in mouse pre-meiotic germ cells results in complete male sterility, with spermatogenesis ultimately arrested at the zygotene stage of meiosis. KDM2A deficiency disrupts H3K36me2/3 deposition in c-KIT+ germ cells, characterized by a reduction in H3K36me2 but a dramatic increase in H3K36me3. Furthermore, KDM2A recruits the transcription factor E2F1 and its co-factor HCFC1 to the promoters of key genes required for meiosis entry and progression, such as Stra8, Meiosin, Spo11, and Sycp1. Collectively, our study unveils an essential role for KDM2A in mediating H3K36me2/3 deposition and controlling the programmed gene expression necessary for the transition from mitosis to meiosis during spermatogenesis.
   The role of histone demethylation in spermatogenesis remains incompletely understood. This work shows that KDM2A demethylates trimethylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) and cooperates with the transcription factor E2F1 and its co-factor HCFC1 during the transition from mitosis to meiosis.KDM2A is essential for meiotic initiation and progression by promoting meiotic gene expression and suppressing the expression of genes involved in spermatogonial development.In male germ cells, KDM2A specifically demethylates H3K36me3, thus increasing H3K36me2 levels.KDM2A interacts with E2F1 and HCFC1 to facilitate meiotic gene expression and ensure proper meiotic progression.
   The balance of H3K36 di- and tri-methylation regulates meiotic gene expression during mouse spermatogenesis.

AB Efforts to enhance refrigeration efficiency and environmental friendliness are underway, focusing on the electrocaloric effect (ECE) as an alternative to traditional compression methods. Maintaining a substantial adiabatic temperature change (Delta T) across a broad temperature span (Tspan) induced by ECE is a significant challenge in achieving efficient, zero-emission ferroelectric refrigeration. This study introduces a stacked composite ceramic (SCC) with broad dielectric peaks, achieved by stacking ceramics with a specific ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The interlayer synergies optimize between layers and amplify polarization changes due to flip domains and lattice distortion, enhancing ECE properties. Notably, SCC exhibits a substantial Delta Tmax of 1.198 K and a wide Tspan of 64 degrees C at 50 kV cm-1, surpassing the cumulative properties of individual components. The study proposes an effective composite design strategy for developing high-performance electrothermal materials with exceptional ECE properties for practical refrigeration applications.

AB Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species, is prevalent in crops and animal feed, posing significant health risks to livestock and humans. FB1 induces oxidative stress in Sertoli cells, destroys testicular structure, and affects spermatogenesis. However, methods to mitigate the reproductive toxicity of FB1 in testes remain unknown. Quercetin, a natural flavonoid antioxidant, may offer protective benefits. This study investigated the protective effects and mechanisms of quercetin against FB1-induced reproductive toxicity in TM4 cells (a Sertoli cell line). The results indicated that 40 mu M quercetin improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis, and preserved cell functions. Quercetin also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in TM4 cells exposed to FB1, enhanced the expression of antioxidant genes, and improved mitochondrial membrane potential. Compared with FB1 alone, the combination of quercetin and FB1 increased ATP levels, as well as pyruvate and lactic acid, the key glycolysis products. Furthermore, this combination elevated the mRNA and protein expression of glycolysis-related genes, including glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1 (Gpi1), hexokinase 2 (Hk2), aldolase (Aldoa), pyruvate kinase, muscle (Pkm), lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) and phosphofructokinase, liver, B-type (Pfkl). Quercetin also boosted the activity of PKM and LDHA, two crucial glycolytic enzymes. In summary, quercetin mitigates FB1-induced toxicity in TM4 cells by reducing ROS levels and enhancing glycolysis. This study offers new insights into preventing and treating FB1-induced toxic damage to the male reproductive system and highlights the potential application of quercetin.

AB Global hydroclimatic variability is increasing with more frequent extreme dry and wet years, severely destabilizing terrestrial ecosystem productivity. However, what regulates the consequence of precipitation extremes on productivity remains unclear. Based on a 9-year field manipulation experiment on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found that the responses of gross primary productivity (GPP) to extreme drought and wetness were differentially regulated by nitrogen (N) deposition. Over increasing N deposition, extreme dry events reduced GPP more. Among the 12 biotic and abiotic factors examined, this was mostly explained by the increased plant canopy height and proportion of drought-sensitive species under N deposition, making photosynthesis more sensitive to hydraulic stress. While extreme wet events increased GPP, their effect did not shift over N deposition. These site observations were complemented by a global synthesis derived from the GOSIF GPP dataset, which showed that GPP sensitivity to extreme drought was larger in ecosystems with higher N deposition, but GPP sensitivity to extreme wetness did not change with N deposition. Our findings indicate that intensified hydroclimatic variability would lead to a greater loss of land carbon sinks in the context of increasing N deposition, due to that GPP losses during extreme dry years are more pronounced, yet without a synchronous increase in GPP gains during extreme wet years. The study implies that the conservation and management against climate extremes merit particular attention in ecosystems subject to N deposition.
   Global hydroclimatic variability is intensifying, with more frequent extreme dry and wet years severely destabilizing terrestrial ecosystem productivity, but what regulates this consequence remains unclear. Combining a field experiment with a global synthesis, we found that over increasing N deposition, extreme dry events reduced productivity more. While extreme wet events increased productivity, their effect did not shift over N deposition. Consequently, the enhanced hydroclimatic variability will increasingly reduce productivity as N deposition increases once extreme drought reduces productivity more than extreme wetness induced an increase in productivity. These findings have important implications for ecosystem conservation and management against climate extremes.image

AB A key question in insect community ecology is whether parasitoid assemblages are structured by the food plants of their herbivore hosts. Tritrophic communities centred on oak-feeding cynipid gallwasps are one of the best-studied tritrophic insect communities. Previous work suggests that host plant identity is a much stronger predictor of oak-cynipid interactions than of cynipid-parasitoid interactions. However, these relationships have not been formally quantified. We reason that the potential for 'bottom-up' effects should increase with host plant phylogenetic diversity. We, therefore, generated quantified interaction network data for previously unstudied tritrophic cynipid communities in Sichuan, China, where, in addition to Quercus, cynipid host plants include Castanea, Castanopsis and Lithocarpus. We characterise these communities taxonomically and compare the extent to which host plant taxonomy predicts plant-herbivore and plant-parasitoid associations. We sampled 42,620 cynipid galls of 176 morphotypes from 23 host plant species, yielding over 4500 specimens of 64 parasitoid morphospecies. Many parasitoids were identifiable to chalcidoid taxa present in other Holarctic oak cynipid communities, with the addition of Cynipencyrtus (Cynipencyrtidae). As elsewhere, Sichuan parasitoid assemblages were dominated by generalists. Gallwasp-plant interaction networks were significantly more modular than parasitoid-plant association networks. Gallwasps were significantly more specialised to host plants (i.e. had higher mean d' values) than parasitoids. Parasitoid assemblages nevertheless showed significant plant-associated beta diversity, with a dominant turnover component. We summarise parallels between our study and other Fagaceae-associated cynipid communities and discuss our findings in light of the processes thought to structure tritrophic interactions centred on endophytic insect herbivores.

AB Nonlinear optical materials are critical for the application of all-solid-state lasers in the mid-infrared spectral region. However, practical materials are still lacking. Experiments and first-principles calculations of second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients are costly and time-consuming. The existing machine learning method for predicting SHG coefficients is limited to specific crystal structures and requires complex feature engineering. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can automatically extract features from crystal structures, achieving state-of-theart performance for many material properties. Here, we construct a SHG coefficient dataset and develop a GNNbased model to predict SHG coefficients quickly. To obtain more complete information, we design bond angle feature, global feature, and global attention pooling layer for graph isomorphic network with high discriminative power. In addition, transfer learning is introduced to improve the generalization ability. Based on these extensions, the proposed model exhibits superior performance over seven competing models. We also offer a clear explanation by visualizing the attention scores. This study provides a promising direction for the development of effective prediction models for SHG coefficients.

AB This article analyzes the frequency regulation problems of load frequency control (LFC) system under some unforseen network environments, such as unexpected load, mixed attacks, and time delay in cyber-physical system (CPS). A dual-link strategy using alternating current and direct current tie-line transmission technologies is employed to improve the efficiency of power exchange and retain the power system frequency stability. Then, an improved integral-based adaptive event-triggered control (IA-ETC) with flexible threshold parameters is designed using the historical average system state to tackle the sudden fluctuations with improved communication efficiency. Furthermore, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with delay terms is proposed to investigate the exponential stability with H-infinity performance on the dual-link LFC system. Finally, simulation results show that this development presents an improved frequency regulation performance.

AB The Ningxiang pig, a distinguished local breed in China, is recognized for its good meat quality traits. This study examines the proteomics of Ningxiang pigs at three developmental stages and delves into the upstream transcriptomics of these proteomics. Such an analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of the molecular interplay between proteins and transcriptomes in the Ningxiang pig muscle, influencing muscle growth and development. In this research, we analyzed the muscles of Ningxiang pigs at three developmental stages: 30 days in weaned piglets, 90 days in nursery pigs, and 210 days in late fattening pigs. There a total of 16 differentially co-expressed miRNAs (ssc-miRNA-1, ssc-miRNA-378, ssc-miRNA-143, ssc-miRNA-30e, etc.), 74 differentially co-expressed mRNA (PLIN3, CPT2, IGF2 and HSP90AB1, etc.) have been identified in the three stages. 572 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) (APOC3, NDUFA2, HSPD1, ATP5E, PDHA1, etc.) were readily identified by comparing different time periods. According to the KEGG enrich pathway results that DAPs most enriched in growth and development pathways, immune mechanism pathways and maintaining functions of physical. Through short time-series expression miner (STEM) association analysis, a total of 571 negative miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs and 2 negative miRNA-mRNA-protein (Chr05_11955-Pig.17268.1-ATP5F1B, ssc-miR-194a-3p-Pig.15802.1-ACY1) interaction pairs were found. Our study provides a theoretical basis on molecular mechanism for the study of IMF deposition, muscle growth and immunity in Ningxiang pig breed.

AB Despite abundant scientific evidence supporting immunization benefits, vaccine hesitancy remains a significant global health concern, particularly during public health crises. Exploring public attitudes towards vaccination is crucial. This study aimed to develop and validate a tailored Public Vaccination Attitudes Scale specifically under the unique circumstances of a public health crisis. A psychometric evaluation was conducted using a cross-sectional study during the peak of a major public health crisis. The scale was developed and its psychometric properties validated using three approaches: (1) generating the item pool through literature research and focus group discussions; (2) assessing the items through expert consultation; and (3) evaluating construct validity, content validity, and internal consistency reliability through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Data from a total of 3921 respondents were randomly divided into two subsets, one for EFA (n = 1935) and the other for CFA (n = 1986). A 22-item draft scale with five factors was created after literature research and focus group discussion. The content validity of this scale ranged between 0.88 and 1.00. EFA showed a 17-item scale with four factors (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7) accounting for 68.044% of the total variance. CFA showed that the values of the fit indices, including convergent validity and discriminant validity, were excellent or acceptable. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.874, and each factor ranged from 0.726 to 0.885. This study introduces a valuable tool for assessing vaccination attitudes during public health crises, aiding researchers, policymakers, and nurses in combating vaccine hesitancy. Emphasizing the importance of fostering vaccine acceptance, it enhances disease control during emergencies, contributing to the knowledge needed for more effective public health strategies and crisis responses

AB Clustering analysis is a powerful tool for discovering potential knowledge in datasets. However, numerous existing clustering algorithms suffer from heavy reliance on parameter settings and cannot cluster complex manifold data very well. Moreover, although non -parameter clustering algorithms aim to lower the usage threshold, their actual performance in clustering is often unsatisfactory. Addressing how to achieve similar clustering effects for numerous data points with only a few core data points during clustering is a valuable consideration. To alleviate these challenges, a non -parameter clustering algorithm is proposed and named N on - p arameter C lustering Algorithm based on C hain P ropagation and N atural Neighbor (NPCCPN) in this paper, by jointly using chain propagation and natural neighbor. Specifically, NPCCPN identifies core points through chain propagation and clusters them using the saturated neighborhood graph. This makes the core data extraction and clustering process efficient and non -parameter. Finally, the performance of the method is validated on 15 complex synthetic datasets and 10 real datasets from public UCI database. The experimental results show that the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm. Purity scores first. ACC scores second without parameters, but the score first algorithm needs to set the parameters.

AB Abnormal expression of the HSF2 gene was shown to be associated with male sterility. Here, we found that HSF2 was highly expressed in the testes of the cattle-yak, especially in adult cattle-yak. However, the expression of HSF2 was significantly lower in the cattle-yak compared to cattle and yak. In addition, the methylation level of the promoter region was significantly higher in cattle-yak compared to yak. We therefore suggest that male cattle-yak sterility may be associated with methylation of the HSF2 gene in testes tissues. This study provides theoretical support for further understanding of male cattle-yak sterility. Aberrant expression of the heat shock proteins and factors was revealed to be closely associated with male reproduction. Heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of diverse developmental pathways. However, the role and the corresponding molecular mechanism of HSF2 in male cattle-yak sterility are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to obtain the sequence and the biological information of the cattle-yak HSF2 gene and to investigate the spatiotemporal expression profiles of the locus during the development of cattle-yak testes. Additionally, the differential expression was analyzed between the cattle-yak and the yak, and the methylation of corresponding promoter regions was compared. Our results showed an additional 54 bp fragment and a missense mutation (lysine to glutamic acid) were presented in the cattle-yak HSF2 gene, which correlated with enriched expression in testicular tissue. In addition, the expression of the HSF2 gene showed dynamic changes during the growth of the testes, reaching a peak in adulthood. The IHC indicated that HSF2 protein was primarily located in spermatocytes (PS), spermatogonia (SP), and Sertoli cells (SC) in cattle-yak testes, compared with the corresponding cells of cattle and the yak. Furthermore, bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) revealed that the methylated CpG sites in the promoter region of the cattle-yak HSF2 were more numerous than in the yak counterpart, which suggests hypermethylation of this region in the cattle-yak. Taken together, the low expression abundance and hypermethylation of HSF2 may underpin the obstruction of spermatogenesis, which leads to male cattle-yak infertility. Our study provided a basic guideline for the HSF2 gene in male reproduction and a new insight into the mechanisms of male cattle-yak sterility.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused some individuals to experience vicarious traumatization (VT), an adverse psychological reaction to those who are primarily traumatized, which may negatively impact one's mental health and well-being and has been demonstrated to vary with personal trauma history. The neural mechanism of VT and how past trauma history affects current VT remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify neurobiological markers that track individual differences in VT and reveal the neural link between childhood cumulative trauma (CCT) and VT. Methods: We used structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before the pandemic to identify prospective brain markers for COVID-related VT by correlating individuals' VT levels during the pandemic with the gray matter volume (GMV) and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and examined how these brain markers linked CCT to VT in a sample of general young adults (N = 115/100). Results: Whole-brain GMV-behavior correlation analysis showed that VT was positively associated with GMV in the right dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (DLPFC). Using the cluster derived from the GMV-behavior correlation analysis as the seed region, we further revealed that the RSFC between the right DLPFC and right precuneus was negatively associated with VT. Importantly, the right DLPFC volume and DLPFC-precuneus RSFC mediated the effect of CCT on VT. These findings remained unaffected by factors such as family socioeconomic status, other stressful life events, and general mental health. Conclusions: Overall, our study presents structural and functional brain markers for VT and highlights these brain-based markers as a potential neural mechanism linking CCT to COVID-related VT, which has implications for treating and preventing the development of trauma-related mental disorders.

AB Ethylenediamine (EDA) is a crucial chemical raw material and fine chemical intermediate. Compared with the industrial approach of ammonolysis of 1,2-dichloroethane, the catalytic amination of ethylene glycol (EG) is an economical and environmentally benign route that will be the future trend for EDA synthesis. Herein, we systemically review the recent progress in direct and indirect catalytic conversion of EG to EDA. Furthermore, different types of catalysts are discussed: (i) supported metal and multimetallic catalysts, (ii) solid acid catalysts, and (iii) other active catalysts (e.g., ionic liquids and metal complexes). Finally, we conclude with the frontiers and future prospects of the catalytic synthesis of EDA from EG and monoethanolamine, providing readers a snapshot of this field.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE

DE Environmental pollution; Early-life experience; Green innovation
ID PERFORMANCE
AB This paper examines the impact of CEOs' early-life exposure to environmental pollution on corporate green innovation. Using a sample of heavily polluting enterprises in China from 2008 to 2021, we find that CEOs who experienced more severe environmental pollution during their childhood are more inclined to promote green innovation. This finding remains robust to various endogeneity and robustness tests. The sensitivity of CEOs to environmental risk can explain this positive relationship. Specifically, the positive effect is more pronounced in companies that invest more in environmental protection and that have higher prevalence of environmental terms in their annual reports. In regions with high environmental regulations, and when led by CEOs with higher levels of education and positive career prospects, the relationship between early-life environmental pollution experience and corporate green innovation is strengthened. Our results contribute to the existing literature regarding the impact of childhood experience on corporate green innovation.

AB Bang Jian has a long-standing history of medicinal use, noted for its detoxifying effects and the treatment of various fevers, laryngitis, and thermal illnesses. Presently, Gentiana veitchiorum and G. szechenyii are the predominant varieties utilized. However, comparative data on their chemical compositions remains scarce. In this study, employing UPLC-Q-TOF/MS metabolomics, conducted a comprehensive comparison of the chemical constituents in G. veitchiorum and G. szechenyii and assessed their antioxidant activities. Results indicated both varieties exhibit significant antioxidant capabilities, with G. szechenyii displaying superior efficacy. The IC50 values for DPPH, Hydroxyl, and ABTS in G. szechenyii were determined to be 0.16, 0.48, and 0.80 mg/mL, respectively. Through UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, 56 compounds were identified, revealing notable differences in metabolite composition between the two species. 24 differential metabolites were identified as potential chemometric markers, facilitating the accurate differentiation of G. veitchiorum and G. szechenyii. Correlation analyses identified six compounds-depressine, szechenyin A, syringic acid, isoorientin-2 ''-O-glucopyranoside, isoscoparin 2 ''-O-glucoside, and naringenin-as significant to the variance in antioxidant activity. These findings enhance our understanding of the phytochemical and antioxidant properties of G. veitchiorum and G. szechenyii, offering a theoretical foundation for their clinical application.

AB The application of butachlor as an herbicide in paddy fields is widely practiced, aiming to increase rice yield by directly or indirectly influencing the paddy environment. Periphytic biofilms, which form at the soil-water interface in paddy fields, are complex bioaggregates that play an important role in nitrogen (N) cycling. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of butachlor on periphytic biofilm growth and N cycling under both light and dark conditions in the laboratory. The results revealed that butachlor application hindered the growth of periphytic biofilms and led to the dominance of Cyanobacteria as the primary prokaryotes, while inhibiting the development of eukaryotic Trebouxiophyceae. Furthermore, the application of butachlor reduced the richness and diversity of prokaryotes, but increased those of eukaryotes in periphytic biofilms. The light treatments exhibited higher total N loss because light favored periphytic biofilm growth and enhanced ammonium (NH+4) assimilation and nitrification. Additionally, butachlor application resulted in the increased retention of NH+4 -N and nitrate (NO-3 )-N and an increase in N loss via denitrification. The abundances of functional genes encoding enzymes such as ammonia monooxygenase, nitrite reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase were increased by butachlor application, favoring nitrification and denitrification processes. Overall, the results suggest that butachlor application leads to an increase in total N loss mainly through denitrification in paddy systems, particularly in the presence of periphytic biofilms. Thus, the results may provide valuable insights into the changes in periphytic biofilm growth and N cycling induced by butachlor, and future studies can further explore the potential implications of these changes in paddy soils.

Here, we explored the effects of RES on the proliferation and functions of yak GCs. Firstly, we evaluated the effect of RES dose and time in culture on the viability of GCs, and then the optimum treatment protocol (10 mu M RES, 36 h) was selected to analyze the effects of RES on the proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, lipid droplet content, ATP production, and steroidogenesis of GCs, as well as the expression of related genes. The results show that RES treatment significantly (1) increased cell viability and proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis by upregulating BCL-2 and SIRT1 genes and downregulating BAX, CASP3, P53, and KU70 genes; (2) increased the proportion of GCs in the S phase and upregulated CCND1, PCNA, CDK4, and CDK5 genes; (3) reduced ROS accumulation and MDA content and increased GSH content, as well as upregulating the relative expression levels of CAT, SOD2, and GPX1 genes; (4) decreased lipid droplet content and increased ATP production; (5) promoted progesterone (P4) secretion and the expression of P4 synthesis-related genes (StAR, HSD3B1, and CYP11A1); and (6) inhibited E2 secretion and CYP19A1 expression. These findings suggest that RES at 10 mu M increases the proliferation and antioxidant properties, inhibits apoptosis, and promotes ATP production, lipid droplet consumption, and P4 secretion of yak GCs.

AB The hydrophilic polysaccharides (PS) were isolated and purified from the tuberous roots of Pseudostellaria heterophylla. The extraction process of PS from Pesudostellariae radix was optimized by single-factor experiments and orthogonal design. The extract was purified by DEAE cellulose column to obtain the pure polysaccharide PHP. Then PHP was treated with different intensities of sonication to study the effect of sonication on PHP's characteristics and its biological activity in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study revealed that ultrasound treatment did not significantly change the properties of PHP. Further, with the increase of ultrasound intensity, PHP enhanced the proliferation and phagocytosis of macrophage RAW264.7. Meanwhile, it could also significantly improve the body's antioxidant activity and immune function. The results of this study demonstrated that PHP has the potential as a food additive with enhanced antioxidant and immune functions, and its biological activities could be enhanced by sonication.

AB miR-129 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including adipogenesis; however, its downstream molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-129 promotes yak adipogenesis in vitro via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Overexpression and interference of miR-129 in yak intramuscular preadipocytes (YIMAs) enhanced and inhibited cell differentiation, respectively, with corresponding changes in cell proliferation. Further investigation revealed that miR-129 enhances AKT and p-AKT activity in the AKT pathway without affecting cell apoptosis, and a specific inhibitor (LY294002) was used to confirm that miR-129 regulates YIMAs proliferation and differentiation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Our findings suggest that miR-129 promotes yak adipogenesis by enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway activity. This study provides the foundation to precisely elucidate the molecular mechanism of miR-129 in YIMAs adipogenesis and develop advanced miRNA-based strategies to improve meat nutrition and obesity-related ailments in beef production.

AB Ir has long been regarded as an alternative ethanol-to-CO2 electrocatalyst, but little is known about the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) mechanism on Ir, especially the C1 pathway selectivity. Thereby, in situ quasiquantitative electrochemical infrared absorption spectroscopy (QEIAS), consisting of total-reflection surfaceenhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), and transmission infrared absorption spectroscopy (TIAS) with a thin-layer flow cell, is established to probe it. Initially, the well-accepted EOR dual-pathway mechanism is confirmed via ATR-SEIRAS and IRAS. Ir-Had species (ca. 2040 cm(-1)), originating from the ethanol dissociation at low potentials, are observed for the first time to replenish the reaction process. Based on it, the apparent Faradaic efficiency of the C1 pathway (FEC1) is readily estimated to be as high as 76.4% (0.7 V) in acidic media. The quantitative analysis of reaction residual verifies these FEC1 results through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and a relative error of only 2-9% exists between the two methods. Thus, Ir might be more efficient for ethanol complete oxidation than other Ptgroup metallic catalysts, especially in acidic media. This work could be necessary for the rational design of Irbased EOR catalysts with high C1 pathway selectivity and low over-potential for direct ethanol fuel cells.

AB City agencies across multiple continents have invested millions of funds in ambitious afforestation projects in urban and peri-urban areas to enhance the city green infrastructure. One example is the Beijing One Million Mu Plain Afforestation Project, which has established 146,000 ha of plantation forests, mainly on arable lands. This contradicts the national arable land conserving policies and has dramatically changed local habitat types and landscape context. However, the impact of these processes on biodiversity is not well understood. To investigate this impact at local and landscape scales, we explored a space-for-time approach. We selected 12 plantation forests and their nearby arable lands along a gradient of plantation forest cover in the surrounding landscapes. We surveyed ground spiders and carabids and analyzed their responses to local habitat type, landscape context, and their interaction. In the sampled landscapes, plantation forest cover increased (12.0%-35.9%), while arable land cover decreased (58.3%-31.8%). 96.3% of the new plantation forests were established on arable lands. Intensive afforestation on arable lands did not increase local ground arthropod diversity. In fact, ground arthropod abundance and species richness in plantation forests were significantly lower than in arable lands when the surrounding arable land cover was relatively high. With surrounding arable land cover decreasing, ground arthropod abundance and species richness in plantation forests increased but did not exceed those in nearby arable lands. Hence, the overall ground arthropod diversity at landscape scale was not improved. These findings suggest that, from a biodiversity conservation perspective, plantation forests did not surpass peri-urban agricultural lands as a better green infrastructure . However, ground arthropods benefit from rich local non-crop herb communities. Conserving peri-urban agricultural lands and implementing extensive management regimes for agricultural lands and existing plantation forests are more effective tools than ambitious afforestation of agricultural land in peri-urban areas of Beijing and other metropolises.

AB Both climate and environment changes can lead to variations in leaf morphological traits within or among herbaceous species. However, evidence for leaf morphological traits of alpine herbaceous species shifts with elevations, particularly under climate warming, is scarce. A field experimental warming experiment was conducted to address these questions in alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. We measured the leaf morphological traits including leaf length, leaf width, leaf perimeter, leaf area of alpine herbaceous species along a slope of the NyenqingTanggula Mountain (from 4600 m to 5200 m) on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results revealed that warming greatly decreased plant cover, species richness, and plant biomass of alpine meadows, but had no significant effects on soil carbon and nutrients. Leaf area across warming and control treatments was on average larger in low-elevation alpine meadows, and smaller toward the high-elevation alpine meadows, with leaf length and length/width ratio significantly decreased with increasing elevations. Leaf area and leaf length were positively corelated with growing season air temperature and soil temperature, but had no significant relationship with growing season precipitation, soil moisture, and photosynthetically active radiation. The decreasing elevational pattern in leaf size could be mainly attributed to the decreasing in leaf length. In response to experimental warming, our results further revealed that leaf size tended to be larger in warming plots than control plots along the elevational gradient, and the warming effects on leaf size varied greatly with herbaceous species. However, warming greatly decreased community-weighted means leaf area in mid-elevations, but increased that in both lower and higher elevations, which were mainly due to warming-induced variations in species richness and plant coverage. Our findings will fill the knowledge gap and provided valuable observational evidence in exploring elevational pattern of leaf size in Tibetan alpine meadows.

AB The breed of pig can affect the diversity and composition of fecal microbiota, but there is a lack of research on the fecal microbiota of hybrid pigs. In this study, feces samples from Chuanxiang black pigs (a hybrid of Tibetan and Duroc pigs) aged 3 days (n = 24), 70 days (n = 31), 10 months (n = 13) and 2 years (n = 30) and Tibetan pigs aged 10 months (n = 14) and 2 years (n = 15) were collected and sequenced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. We also measured the weight of all the tested pigs and found that the 10-month-old and two-year-old Chuanxiang black pigs weighed about three times the weight of Tibetan pigs of the same age. After comparing the genus-level microbiota composition of Tibetan pigs and Chuanxiang black pigs at 10 months and two years of age, we found that Treponema and Streptococcus were the two most abundant bacteria in Chuanxiang black pigs, while Treponema and Chirstensenellaceae_R.7_group were the two most abundant bacteria in Tibetan pigs. Prediction of microbial community function in adult Chuanxiang black pigs and Tibetan pigs showed changes in nutrient absorption, disease resistance, and coarse feeding tolerance. In addition, we also studied the changes in fecal microbiota in Chuanxiang black pigs at 3 days, 70 days, 10 months, and 2 years of age. We found that the ecologically dominant bacteria in fecal microbiota of Chuanxiang black pigs changed across developmental stages. For example, the highest relative abundance of 70-day-old Chuanxiang black pigs at the genus level was Prevotella. We identified specific microbiota with high abundance at different ages for Chuanxiang black pigs, and revealed that the potential functions of these specific microbiota were related to the dominant phenotype such as fast growth rate and strong disease resistance. Our findings help to expand the understanding of the fecal microbiota of hybrid pigs and provide a reference for future breeding and management of hybrid pigs.

AB Three novel copper Schiff base complexes, (LCu)-Cu-1(OAc)-(LCu)-Cu-3(OAc), bearing NNO tridentate ligands were synthesized and successfully entrapped in zeolite. All free and encapsulated complexes were fully characterized through experiments combined with theoretical calculations, and were subsequently employed as catalysts to activate H2O2 for degradation of methylene blue (MB). The catalytic activity of free complexes was tunable by substitution effects. The complex (LCu)-Cu-3(OAc) displayed enhanced efficiency by adopting bulky and donor substitutions due to the lower oxidation states. However, the free complexes exhibited modified structural and catalytic properties upon encapsulation into the zeolite. The constraint from the zeolite holes and coordination geometry caused the alteration of electronic structures and subsequently modified the reactivity. This study revealed that upon encapsulation, the larger molecular dimension of (LCu)-Cu-3(OAc) resulted in additional distorted geometry, leading to higher catalytic efficiency for MB degradation with more blue shifts in the UV-Vis spectrum. There was high catalytic activity by (LCu)-Cu-n(OAc)-Y compared to that of the free complex, and high recyclability under near neutral conditions. In addition, the catalytic efficiency of (LCu)-Cu-3(OAc)-Y was higher or equivalent compared to other catalysts. This work provides new complexes with NNO tridentate ligands encapsulated inside zeolite and explains the relationship between the modified structure and functionality.

AB Using the halotolerant green microalgae Dunaliella salina as a model organism has special merits, such as a wide range of salt tolerance, unicellular organism, and simple life cycle and growth conditions. These unique characteristics make it suitable for salt stress study. In order to provide an overview of the response of Dunaliella salina to salt stress and hopefully to reveal evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of photosynthetic organisms in response to salt stress, the transcriptomes and the genome of the algae were sequenced by the second and the third-generation sequencing technologies, then the transcriptomes under salt stress were compared to the transcriptomes under non-salt stress with the newly sequenced genome as the reference genome. The major cellular biological processes that being regulated in response to salt stress, include transcription, protein synthesis, protein degradation, protein folding, protein modification, protein transport, cellular component organization, cell redox homeostasis, DNA repair, glycerol synthesis, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis. This study gives a comprehensive overview of how Dunaliella salina responses to salt stress at transcriptomic level, especially characterized by the nearly ubiquitous up-regulation of the genes involving in protein folding, DNA repair, and cell redox homeostasis, which may confer the algae important mechanisms to survive under salt stress. The three fundamental biological processes, which face huge challenges under salt stress, are ignored by most scientists and are worth further deep study to provide useful information for breeding economic important plants competent in tolerating salt stress, other than only depending on the commonly acknowledged osmotic balance and ion homeostasis.

TI Functional characterization of two TolC in the resistance to drugs and

AB TolC is an outer membrane protein that is responsible for the efflux of multi-substrates in Gram-negative bacteria. Riemerella anatipestifer CH-1 encodes two TolC proteins, B739_0871 (TolCA) and B739_1784 (TolCB). TolCB was previously involved in the export of manganese (Mn). However, whether TolCB has other substrates is unclear, and the functions of TolCA remain to be characterized. Here, we show that deletion of tolCA renders the bacteria hypersensitive to the gentamicin, the SDS, and various metals, such as Mn(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Fe(II), Co(II), and Ni(II). By contrast, the deletion of tolCB only conferred high sensitivity to Mn. Consistently, the deletion of tolCA led to intracellular accumulation of the various tested metals, while the deletion of tolCB only led to Mn accumulation under conditions of excess Mn. Moreover, the tolCA deletion mutant (triangle tolCA) but not the tolCB deletion mutant (triangle tolCB) was more sensitive to the NaOCl than the wild type (WT). Strikingly, the triangle tolCA but not triangle tolCB decreased the frequency of clones resistant to several tested antibiotics. In the duck infection model, the triangle tolCA but not triangle tolCB decreased virulence and colonization of R. anatipestifer CH-1, possibly due to increased sensitivity of triangle tolCA to non-inactivated duck serum as compared to the WT. Finally, genome mining revealed that homologs of tolCA and tolCB are highly conserved across R. anatipestifer strains and also present in other members of Flavobacteriaceae. Taken together, our results revealed that compared with TolCB, TolCA has a wider range of efflux substrates and functions in R. anatipestifer CH-1.

AB Introduction: Traditional animal- and mineral-based medicines are widely used in the Gansu-Ningxia-Inner Mongolia junction zone, a region with diverse ethnic groups and cultures. This study aims to document, conserve, and explore the potential of these medicines for further research and sustainable development of ethnic medicine.Methods: We interviewed 56 informants from different ethnic backgrounds and analyzed their responses quantitatively. Additionally, a comparative analysis with adjacent regions was conducted, providing invaluable contextual insights.Results: The study unveiled a diverse array of traditional medicines in the Gansu-Ningxia-Inner Mongolia junction zone. A total of 47 animal-based medicines were identified, ranging from insects and scorpios to distinctive animal organs. Of notable significance was Moschus, emerging as a pivotal traditional Chinese medicine resource. In parallel, 12 mineral-based medicines were cataloged, procured both locally and from "pharmacies". Female informants, frequently local herbal practitioners, demonstrated broader knowledge of medicines. The analysis of 13 villages revealed varying perceptions of medicine importance, underscoring the wealth of traditional knowledge. Specific medicines, such as Feng-Mi and Xie-Zi, were widely used and valued in local healthcare practices for their cultural and medicinal benefits.Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive overview of traditional animal- and mineral-based medicines in the Gansu-Ningxia-Inner Mongolia junction zone. It highlights the need for preserving and applying these practices in a sustainable manner. It also lays a solid foundation for future research on ethnic medicine, which can contribute to the holistic wellbeing of local communities.

AB A phytochemical investigation of Selaginella tamariscina led to the isolation of 17 selaginellin derivatives. Their inhibitory activities against breast cancer cells were screened, and preliminary structure-activity relationships were also established. Among them, dimeric selaginellin 17 showed potential activity against MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC50 value of 3.2 +/- 0.1 mu M, corresponding to 4-fold higher potency than the reference compound 5-FU (IC50 14.8 +/- 0.2 mu M). Mechanistic studies indicated that 17 could cause G2/M phase arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis accompanied by increased ROS levels.

AB Maintaining normal functions of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) is essential for oocyte development and maturation. The dysfunction of GCs impairs nutrition supply and estrogen secretion by follicles, thus negatively affecting the breeding capacity of farm animals. Impaired GCs is generally associated with declines in Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, which triggers un-controlled oxidative stress, and the oxidative stress, thus, attack the subcellular structures and cause cell damage. beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a NAD(+) precursor, has demonstrated well-known antioxidant properties in several studies. In this study, using two types of ovarian GCs (mouse GCs (mGCs) and human granulosa cell line (KGN)) as cell models, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of NMN on gene expression patterns and antioxidant capacity of both mGCs and KGN that were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As shown in results of the study, mGCs that were exposed to H2O2 significantly altered the gene expression patterns, with 428 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared with those of the control group. Furthermore, adding NMN to H2O2-cultured mGCs displayed 621 DEGs. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly enriched in key pathways like cell cycle, senescence, and cell death. Using RT-qPCR, CCK8, and beta-galactosidase staining, we found that H2O2 exposure on mGCs obviously reduced cell activity/mRNA expressions of antioxidant genes, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cellular senescence. Notably, NMN supplementation partially prevented these H2O2-induced abnormalities. Moreover, these similar beneficial effects of NMN on antioxidant capacity were confirmed in the KGN cell models that were exposed to H2O2. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that NMN supplementation protects against H2O2-induced impairments in gene expression pattern, cell cycle arrest, and cell death in ovarian GCs through boosting NAD(+ )levels and provide potential strategies to ameliorate uncontrolled oxidative stress in ovarian GCs.

AB An efficient PhI(OAc)2-mediated regioselective hydrothiolation of allenamides with thiophenol via a radical process was developed to create a workable route to vinyl sulfides. The reaction exhibits a good functional group tolerance and high efficiency, affording the products in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the radical cascade proceeds through an allyl radical intermediate, which is formed via the addition of the PhS radical to the central carbon of allenamides. Moreover, the reaction was also efficient with selenophenol, providing the corresponding product, vinyl selenide, in a 99% yield.

AB Osmotic stress in the yeast limits productivity in industrial beer production under very high gravity brewing. This study focused on assessing the protective impacts of eleven plant-derived antioxidant dipeptides (PADs) on the osmotic stress tolerance of lager yeast. The results showed that PADs provided yeast with stress tolerance under osmotic stress. PADs supplementation enhanced cell membrane integrity and reduced oxidative damage. PADs upregulated the expression of SOD2, PEX11 and CTT1 genes under osmotic stress. Moreover, the volatile compounds contents and antioxidant activities of beers were improved by PADs, suggesting favorable quality characteristics. Especially, Phe-Cys and Leu-His could increase the DPPH radical scavenging activity of beer by 41.92% and 18.78% respectively, compared with control. Therefore, PADs are industrially scalable enhancers to improve the ability of yeast to resist osmotic stress and beer quality during very high gravity brewing.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) provides a promising technology that can improve the energy efficiency of wireless communications, by building the controllable wireless propagation environment with the utilization of massive passive reflecting elements. Motivated by this, we apply the IRS to assist the data collection based on collaborative beamforming in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). With the objective to maximize the network lifetime, we present an energy-efficient joint collaborative and passive beamforming design for an IRS-assisted WSN, which jointly optimizes the beamforming vector for all nodes and phase shifts for IRS's reflecting elements. To efficiently resolve the joint optimization problem, we develop a penalty dual-decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm combined with the augmented Lagrangian method, penalty-based method and block coordinate descent algorithm, which decomposes the joint optimization problem into four simplified subproblems. Especially, in solving IRS's phase-shift optimization subproblem, we formulate this subproblem as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem and further propose a low computational complexity approximate iteration algorithm to resolve this QCQP problem, which iteratively linearizes this QCQP problem to a sequence of approximate programming with linear equality constraints, whose closed-form solution is presented. Theoretical analysis indicates the proposed algorithm can converge to a KKT solution. Simulation results indicate that the IRS-assisted design and proposed algorithm improve the energy efficiency and prolong the network lifetime as compared to alternative algorithms.

AB The adsorption of small gas molecules (CO, O2 and N2) on Pt-capped armchair and zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) has been investigated by density functional theory (DFT) method to determine the potential for gas sensor detection. Results indicated that O2 and N2 molecules with lower adsorption energies (1.66 eV and 1.00 eV) exhibited weak chemical adsorption on SWCNT(4,4)-Pt. However, CO demonstrates strong chemical adsorption with a high adsorption energy of 2.23 eV on SWCNT(4,4)-Pt. The adsorption energy of CO on SWCNT (7,0)-Pt shows the chemical adsorption between CO and SWCNT(7,0)-Pt. In addition, these findings also implied Pt-capped SWCNT could act as small gas molecule sensors to detect CO toxic gas at room temperature. In this system, CO is the electron donor and SWCNT-Pt is the electron receptor. The interaction of Pt and carbon nanotube backbone delocalized pi electrons could not only increases the conductivity of SWCNT-Pt, but also enhances the conductivity of SWCNT-Pt-CO. The HOMO-LUMO gap (Delta epsilon) of Pt-capped SWCNT(7,0) reduced from 0.43 eV to 0.39 eV after CO adsorption, and the Delta epsilon value of Pt-capped SWCNT(4,4) decreased by 0.08 eV. The electrical conductivity of Pt-capped armchair and zigzag SWCNT has increased after the adsorption of CO molecule. The results may be helpful for designing a promising Pt-capped SWCNT-based CO sensors.

AB Relying on co-precipitation and thermally induced phase separation methods, a novel triple-layered heterojunction catalytic electrode membrane (PVDF/La/Sm/CeO2, LMOHCEM) was developed and applied in coupled microbial fuel cell and membrane bioreactor (CMMS), achieving enhanced performance for treating tannery wastewater. Hydrophobic LMOHCEM exhibits increased electrochemical activity (qT* 3.53 x 10-3C cm-2, qo* 2.2 x 10-3C cm-2), indicating superior electron transfer efficiency. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process mediated by LMOHC follows a 2 x 2 e- transfer pathway, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrates a negative Bader charge (-60 |e|) for the synthesized catalyst. To serve for engineering, the CMMS was implemented in the operation of continuous-flow for tannery wastewater treatment, the system achieved optimized pollutant removal property (COD 98.3%, Cr 99.1%, Sulfide and Sulfate 100%). Based on the segmented tracing strategy, the whole process of carbon/sulfur production of the electrochemical membrane reactor was analyzed. Microbial community analysis confirmed the dominant functional bacteria in the reactor. Elucidated multiple removal pathways and underlying purification mechanisms related to chromium and organic matter in the CMMS were proposed. Overall, this work provides a perspective for exploring an electrochemical membrane reactor with enhanced removal features for efficient electroplating wastewater treatment through typical element tracing analysis.

TI Memory effect of spider major ampullate silk in loading-unloading cycles

AB Spider silk is repeatedly stretched while performing biological functions. There is a close relationship between the shape change of the fibre materials and their mechanical properties. However, the effect of the deformation and interval time on the structure and tensile behaviour properties of spider silk after repeatedly stretching by given strain value has been rarely reported. Here we found that major ampullate silk (MAS) can revert its tensile behaviour independent of its previous loading history via intervals of approximately 8 s to 5 min with constant and increased elongation, respectively, after being subjected to yield and hardening regions. The true stress-true strain curve beyond a given value of true strain is independent from the previous loading history of the sample. Even after longer intervals (>= 1 h), MAS can reproduce the last tensile behaviour via one stretched. Despite recognizing the development of irreversible deformations in the material when tested in air, the reversible change in tensile behaviour outside the spider silk's elastic region has rarely been observed before. MAS has at least one proper ground state that allows it to present good shape and mechanical behaviour memory in terms of longitudinal stretching, functioning as a new strategy to achieve certain tensile properties. The analysis of the true stress-true strain curves was performed from a series of loading-unloading tests to evaluate the evolution of those mechanical parameters with the cycle number. The elastic modulus measured in the loading steps increases monotonously with increasing values of true strain reached in the cycles. In contrast, a marginal variation is found in the values of the yield stress measured in the different cycles. The memory and variation in the mechanical behaviour and performance of MAS can be accounted for through the irreversible and reversible deformation micromechanisms and its combination in which the viscoelasticity of the material plays a leading role. These findings may be helpful to guide the biomimetic design of novel fibre materials such as spider silk gut via artificially stretching spider silk glands.

AB PurposeCerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury remains a leading cause of mobility and mortality among patients with ischemic stroke. This study aims to develop a human serum albumin (HSA)-enriched nanoparticle platform for solubilizing clopidogrel bisulfate (CLP) for intravenous administration, and to explore the protective effect of HSA-enriched nanoparticles loaded with CLP (CLP-ANPs) against cerebral I/R injury in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model.MethodsCLP-ANPs were synthesized via a modified nanoparticle albumin-bound technology, lyophilized, and then characterized by morphology, particle size, zeta potential, drug loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency, stability and in vitro release kinetics. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted using Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Also, an MCAO rat model was established to explore the therapeutic effect of CLP-ANPs on cerebral I/R injury.ResultsCLP-ANPs remained spherical particles with a layer of proteins forming protein corona. Lyophilized CLP-ANPs after dispersion displayed an average size of about 235.6 +/- 6.6 nm (PDI = 0.16 +/- 0.08) with a zeta potential of about - 13.5 +/- 1.8 mV. CLP-ANPs achieved sustained release for up to 168 h in vitro. Next, a single injection of CLP-ANPs dose-dependently reversed the histopathological changes induced by cerebral I/R injury possibly via attenuating apoptosis and reducing oxidative damages in the brain tissues.ConclusionsCLP-ANPs represent a promising and translatable platform system for the management of cerebral I/R injury during ischemic stroke.

AB Simple Summary Plant species diversity has been substantially studied in relation to livestock grazing intensity. However, the effect of grazing on arthropod species diversity has seldom been addressed. Here, we report the results of a two-year plant and arthropod survey from 2020 to 2021 for four levels of grazing intensity, including nongrazing (as a control), light grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing, of the long-term grazing experiment starting in 2016. We found that the species richness and diversity of the major arthropod species groups (including herbivores, parasitoids, and detritivores, including both saprophages and coprophages) peaked (albeit statistically non-significantly in specific years) in the moderate grazing treatment, whereas predator species richness and diversity did not differ significantly among the different treatments. The data indicate that the relationship between grazing intensity and arthropod diversity is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which postulates that moderate grazing should be applied in pastures to maximize multi-functional ecosystem services. Livestock grazing is an important tool used in grassland land management practices. Studies have substantially addressed the effect of grazing on plant species diversity, revealing that moderate grazing increases plant species diversity. However, few studies have dealt with the relationship between grazing and arthropod species diversity, which remains unclear. Here, we hypothesize that moderate grazing promotes arthropod species diversity because arthropods are directly or indirectly dependent on plant diversity. In this study, we conducted a two-year plant and arthropod survey from 2020 to 2021 at four levels of grazing intensity, i.e., nongrazing (as a control), light grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing, of the long-term grazing experiment starting in 2016. The data show that plant species diversity peaked in the moderate grazing treatment, and herbivore species diversity was positively correlated with plant species diversity (and hence peaked in the moderate grazing treatment). Moderate grazing promoted parasitoid species diversity, which was positively correlated with herbivore species diversity. However, predator species diversity did not significantly differ among the four treatments. In addition, saprophage species diversity decreased, whereas coprophages increased with increasing grazing levels, such that species richness (but not species diversity of detritivores statistically) was highest in the moderate grazing treatment. Consequently, the species diversity of arthropods as a whole peaked at the moderate grazing level, a phenomenology that is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Considering that moderate grazing has been found to increase plant species diversity, facilitate soil carbon accumulation, and prevent soil erosion, we suggest that moderate grazing would maximize multi-functional ecosystem services.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to clone the mRNA sequence of the Acyl-CoA dehydro-genase long chain (ACADL) gene of goats and explore the effect of ACADL on the differen-tiation of subcutaneous fat cells on this basis.Methods: We obtained the ACADL gene of goats by cloning and used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect the ACADL expression patterns of different goat tissues and subcutaneous fat cells at different lipid induction stages. In addition, we transfect intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes separately by constructing overexpressed ACADL vectors and synthesizing Si-ACADL; finally, we observed the changes in oil red stained cell levels under the microscope, and qPCR detected changes in mRNA levels.Results: The results showed goat ACADL gene expressed in sebum fat. During adipocyte differentiation, ACADL gradually increased from 0 to 24 h of culture, and decreased. Overexpression of ACADL promoted differentiation of subcutaneous adipocytes in goat and inhibited their differentiation after interference.Conclusion: So, we infer ACADL may have an important role in positive regulating the differentiation process in goat subcutaneous adipocytes. This study will provide basic data for further study of the role of ACADL in goat subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation and lays the foundation for final elucidating of its molecular mechanisms in regulating subcutaneous fat deposition in goats.

AB Smart cities have been a popular topic for the city stakeholders. A smart city is the next urban lifestyle that citizens expect. Due to the hypercompetitive and globalized economy, many cities have already started or are about to start their smart city projects. There is no uniform benchmark to evaluate the smart cities' performance. Several organizations use their own indicators to evaluate smart cities worldwide or nationwide. This research paper leverages fuzzy logic to label smart city leaders and followers based on various organization's evaluation meta results and then uses machine learning techniques to identify the key characteristics of leaders and followers. Based on the training data performance, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to predict who will be the next smart city leader or follower. According to the proposed prediction framework, we have successfully predicted 30 smart city leaders and 20 followers.

AB H. virescens is a perennial herbaceous plant with highly tolerant to cold weather, but the key genes that respond to low temperature stress still remain unclear. Hence, RNA-seq was performed using leaves of H. virescens treated at 0 & DEG;C and 25 & DEG;C for 12 h, 36 h, and 60 h, respectively, and a total of 9416 DEGs were significantly enriched into seven KEGG pathways. The LC-QTRAP platform was performed using leaves of H. virescens leaves at 0 & DEG;C and 25 & DEG;C for 12 h, 36 h, and 60 h, respectively, and a total of 1075 metabolites were detected, which were divided into 10 categories. Additionally, 18 major metabolites, two key pathways, and six key genes were mined using a multi-omics analytical strategy. The RT-PCR results showed that with the extension of treatment time, the expression levels of key genes in the treatment group gradually increased, and the difference between the treatment group and the control group was extremely significant. Notably, the functional verification results showed that the key genes positively regulated cold tolerance of H. virescens. These results can lay a foundation for the in-depth analysis of the mechanism of response of perennial herbs to low temperature stress.

AB Desiccation cracking is a common deterioration that occurs in archaeological excavation sites and greatly threatens long-term preservation. The aim of this research is to comprehensively evaluate the development degree of desiccation cracking (DOC) and explore the relationships between soil properties and its development. Seven indicators are selected to comprehensively describe the DOC, and principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to calculate the weight of each indicator. Linear correlation analysis (LCA) is adopted to calculate the correlations of six soil properties and DOC. The results showed that each indicator has an influence on the DOC. The clay particle content, clay mineral content, and plasticity index showed a positive correlation with the DOC, and the moisture content showed a negative correlation. This research proposed a comprehensive evaluation method to describe the development degree of deterioration at the earthen site, and the results revealed the internal factors influencing desiccation cracking from a qualitative perspective, which can lay a foundation for further conservation research.

AB Herpetin, an active compound derived from the seeds of Herpetospermum caudigerum Wall., is a traditional Tibetan herbal medicine that is used for the treatment of hepatobiliary diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stimulant effect of herpetin on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to improve acute liver injury (ALI). In vitro results showed that herpetin treatment enhanced expression of the liver-specific proteins alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, and cytokeratin 18; increased cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily a member 4 activity; and increased the glycogen-storage capacity of BMSCs. Mice with ALI induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) were treated with a combination of BMSCs by tail-vein injection and herpetin by intraperitoneal injection. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and serum biochemical index detection showed that the liver function of ALI mice improved after administration of herpetin combined with BMSCs. Western blotting results suggested that the stromal cell-derived factor-1/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 axis and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the liver tissue were activated after treatment with herpetin and BMSCs. Therefore, herpetin is a promising BMSC induction agent, and coadministration of herpetin and BMSCs may affect the treatment of ALI.

AB Yaks have evolved several breeds or genetic resources owing to their geographical and ecological environment, and investigating the genetic construction of body size among breeds is key for breeding. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed for five body size traits in 31 yak breeds and genetic resources. The information from clustering individuals according to their habitats was used for kinship grouping in the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM). We named this approach the pCMLM method. A total of 3,584,464 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained, and six markers were found to be significantly associated with height by pCMLM. Four candidate genes, including FXYD6, SOHLH2, ADGRB2, and OSBPL6, were identified. Our results show that when CMLM cannot identify optimal clustering groups, pCMLM can provide sufficient associated results based on population information. Moreover, this study provides basic information on the gene localization of quantitative traits of body size among yak breeds.

AB Aichivirus D (AiV-D) is a newly emerging Kobuvirus detected in bovine and sheep, and information is limited regarding its biological significance and prevalence. This study aimed to explore both the prevalence and characteristics of AiV-D in yaks. From May to August 2021, 117 fecal samples were collected from yaks with diarrhea in three provinces of China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 15 of which were selected and pooled for metagenomic analysis. A high abundance of AiV-D sequences was obtained. Of the 117 diarrhea samples, 29 (24.8%) tested AiV-D-positive, including 33.3% (14/42) from Sichuan, 21.1% (8/38) from Qinghai, and 18.9% (7/37) from Tibet, respectively, suggesting a wide geographical distribution of the AiV-D in yaks in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Furthermore, three AiV-D strains were successfully isolated using Vero cells. Significantly, the AiV-D strain could cause diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and inflammation in yak calves via oral inoculation. The virus was distributed in the ileum, jejunum, duodenum, colon, cecum, and rectum. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the genome and capsid protein P1 (VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes), the yak AiV-D strains likely represent a novel genotype of AiV-D. On the whole, this study identified a novel genotype of AiV-D from yaks, which was successfully isolated, and confirmed that this virus is a diarrhea pathogen in yaks and has a wide geographical distribution in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results expand the host range of AiV-D and the pathogen spectrum of yaks and have significant implications for diagnosing and controlling diarrhea in yaks.IMPORTANCE In this study, we identified and successfully isolated a novel genotype of AiV-D from yaks.

AB On-line transaction processing (OLTP) systems rely on transaction logging and quorum-based consensus protocol to guarantee durability, high availability and strong consistency. This makes the log manager a key component of distributed database management systems (DDBMSs). The leader of DDBMSs commonly adopts a centralized logging method to writing log entries into a stable storage device and uses a constant log replication strategy to periodically synchronize its state to followers. With the advent of new hardware and high parallelism of transaction processing, the traditional centralized design of logging limits scalability, and the constant trigger condition of replication can not always maintain optimal performance under dynamic workloads. In this paper, we propose a new log manager named Salmo with scalable logging and adaptive replication for distributed database systems. The scalable logging eliminates centralized contention by utilizing a highly concurrent data structure and speedy log hole tracking. The kernel of adaptive replication is an adaptive log shipping method, which dynamically adjusts the number of log entries transmitted between leader and followers based on the real-time workload. We implemented and evaluated Salmo in the open-sourced transaction processing systems Cedar and DBx1000. Experimental results show that Salmo scales well by increasing the number of working threads, improves peak throughput by 1.56x and reduces latency by more than 4x over log replication of Raft, and maintains efficient and stable performance under dynamic workloads all the time.

AB The aquaculture of the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis has become the leading and pillar of aquaculture in China. The tremor disease (TD) caused by Spiroplasma eriocheiris is the most destructive disease of E. sinensis. At present, the treatment of TD in crabs mainly depends on antibiotics. To protect the environment and the health of aquatic products, it is urgent to establish an effective and pollution-free green prevention and control technology. This study aimed to investigate the prevention and control of the TD by immunization with chicken yolk anti-body (IgY). Anti -S. eriocheiris IgY was obtained by intramuscular injection of ultrasonically inactivated S. eriocheiris into chickens. After successful isolation and purification of IgY from eggs, ELISA and sensitivity tests were performed. Specific IgY was able to specifically react at a titer of 1:10,000 to antigen at a minimum concentration of 20 mu g/mL and to inhibit the growth of S. eriocheiris in vitro. The affection of IgY in vivo to resist S. eriocheiris infection was demonstrated by feeding or injection of specific IgY. The copy number of S. eriocheiris in crab hemocytes with specific IgY administration was significantly less than in crabs that received normal IgY or without IgY. Meanwhile, the survival rate of E. sinensis with anti-S.eriocheiris-specific IgY using both injection and feeding methods significantly increased during S. eriocheiris infection. The electron microscope results showed that the structure of S. eriocheiris in specific IgY group was completely irregular and broken pin vivo. Finally, this study provides a reference for clarifying the potential role of specific IgY to help E. sinensis resist S. eriocheiris infection.

AB Ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a critical variable in quantifying the efficiency and capacity of an ecosystem to sequestrate carbon (C) from the atmosphere. However, how CUE responds to land-use change and climate warming remains elusive and lacks empirical evidence. We implemented a field manipulative experiment to examine the effects of clipping and warming on CUE in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau over 7 years. The results showed that clipping significantly increased CUE by 7.1%, which was mainly attributed to the stronger positive effects of clipping on gross ecosystem productivity (GEP, 13.0%) than on ecosystem respiration (ER, 5.3%). In contrast, warming had a minor effect on CUE due to the synchronized increase in GEP (8.8%) and ER (7.3%). There was no significant interactive effect of clipping and warming on CUE. Moreover, the dominance of grasses played a pivotal role in controlling the responses of CUE to clipping and warming by increasing ecosystem C uptakes but decreasing microbial decomposition. Soil temperature and above-ground net primary productivity also contributed to the changes in CUE under clipping and warming. These results suggest that clipping once a year at the end of the growing season could increase the efficiency of this alpine meadow for C sequestration, while climate warming could not change ecosystem C use efficiency. We highlight that the dominance of grasses is an emerging property in determining CUE under land-use change and climate warming in grasslands.

AB Feline viral diarrhea is a significant cause of death in kittens. In this study, 12 mammalian viruses were identified by metagenomic sequencing in diarrheal feces in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Interestingly, a novel of felis catus papillomavirus (FcaPV) was identified for the first time in China. Subsequently, we investigated the prevalence of FcaPV in 252 feline samples, including 168 diarrheal feces and 84 oral swabs, with a total of 57 (22.62%, 57/252) samples detected positive. Of the 57 positive samples, FcaPV genotype 3 (FcaPV-3) was detected at high prevalence rate (68.42%, 39/57), followed by FcaPV-4 (22.8%, 13/57), FcaPV-2 (17.54%, 10/57), and FcaPV-1 (1.75%, 1/55), while no FcaPV-5 and FcaPV-6. In addition, two novel putative FcaPVs were identified, which were the highest similarity to Lambdapillomavirus from Leopardus wiedii or canis familiaris, respectively. Therefore, this study was the first characterization of the viral diversity in feline diarrheal feces and the prevalence of FcaPV in Southwest China.

AB Background Schizophrenia is regarded as a brain network or connectome disorder that is associated with neurodevelopment. Children with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) provide an opportunity to evaluate the neuropathology of schizophrenia at a very early stage without potential confounding factors. But dysfunction in brain networks of schizophrenia is inconsistent.Purpose To identify abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in EOS patients and relationships with clinical symptoms, we aimed to reveal neuroimaging phenotypes of EOS.Study Type Prospective, cross-sectional.Population Twenty-six female/22 male patients (age:14.3 +/- 3.45 years) with first-episode EOS, 27 female/22 male age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) (age:14.1 +/- 4.32).Field Strength/Sequence3-T, resting-state (rs) gradient-echo echo-planar imaging and three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo imaging.Assessment Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale-Fourth edition for Children (WISC-IV). The clinical symptoms were evaluated by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). FC strength (FCS) from rs functional MRI (rsfMRI) was used to investigate functional integrity of global brain regions. In addition, associations between regionally altered FCS and clinical symptoms in EOS patients were examined.Statistical Tests Two-sample t-test controlling for sample size, diagnostic method, brain volume algorithm, and age of the subjects, Bonferroni correction, Pearson's correlation analysis. A P-valueCompared with HC, EOS patients had significantly lower total IQ scores (IQ:91.5 +/- 16.1), increased FCS in the bilateral precuneus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left thalamus, and left parahippocampus (paraHIP), and decreased FCS in the right cerebellum posterior lobe and right superior temporal gyrus. The PANSS total score of EOS patients (PANSS total score:74.30 +/- 7.23) was found to be positively correlated to FCS in the left paraHIP (r = 0.45).Data ConclusionOur study revealed that disrupted FC of brain hubs illustrate multiple abnormalities in brain networks in EOS patients.Evidence Level 1Technical Efficacy Stage 2

AB The Western Sichuan Plateau (WSP), which is located in the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, exhibits a unique climate featuring high altitude, thin air, low air temperature, and strong solar radiation. The local residents have developed a unique thermal sensation as a result of climatic adaptation, which cannot be accurately described using existing thermal sensation evaluation models. Therefore, we con-ducted a field study of the thermal sensation of the herdsmen living in tents in two typical areas located in the WSP. We measured the thermal environment parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, air speed, and black-globe temperature) on site and simultaneously conducted a questionnaire regarding the activity level, clothing insulation, and thermal sensation of the residents. A statistical regression analysis was performed, and the results showed a difference of 5.7 degrees C and 3.2 degrees C between the actual and predicted thermal neutral temperatures of the residents in the WSP during winter and summer, respectively. To improve the prediction accuracy, an adaptive predicted mean vote (aPMV) model incorporated with an adaptive coefficient was established for the WSP. The aPMV model can accurately predicted the thermal sensation levels of the local herdsmen living in tents. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We aimed to assess the potential of ultrasonic treatment on the processing of polysaccharides as functional foods or food additives. The polysaccharide from Sinopodophyllum hexandrum fruit (SHP, 52.46 kDa, 1.91 nm) was isolated and purified. SHP was treated with various levels of ultrasound (250 W and 500 W), resulting in the formation of two polysaccharides, SHP1 (29.37 kD, 1.40 nm) and SHP2 (36.91 kDa, 0.987 nm). Ultrasonic treatment was found to reduce the surface roughness and molecular weight of the polysaccharides, leading to thinning and fracturing. The effect of ultrasonic treatment on polysaccharide activity was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vivo experiments showed that ultrasonic treatment improved the organ index. Simultaneously, it enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, and decreased the content of malondialdehyde in the liver. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ultrasonic treatment also promoted proliferation, nitric oxide secretion, phagocytic efficiency, costimulatory factors (CD80+, CD86+) expression, and cytokine(IL-6, IL-1 beta) production of RAW264.7 macrophages.

AB Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium-doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H-2 at room temperature, delivering >99 % yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co-Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.

AB To investigate the characteristics of different LAB strains isolated from subtropics and their effects on Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) silage with two dry matter (DM) levels, sugar fermentation pattern, and growth profiles of three screened lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains [Pediococcus pentosaceus (PP04), Weissella cibaria (WC10), and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP694)] were characterized, and then used either individually or in combination at 1.0 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) fresh weight to inoculate grass having 15% or 25% DM. Treatments were applied: (1) no inoculant (control); (2) PP04; (3) WC10; (4) LP694; (5) M-1 (PP04: WC10 = 2:1); (6) M-2 (PP04: LP694 = 1:2); (7) M-3 (WC10: LP694 = 2:1); (8) M-4 (PP04: WC10: LP694 = 2:1:1). The results showed that all inoculations increased LAB, DM recovery, and lactic acid (LA) concentration, while decreasing pH, the ammonia nitrogen/total nitrogen (NH3-N/TN), and butyric acid (BA) concentration compared to control group in both DM. However, the effect of inoculations was very limited at 15% DM. Silages with inoculants achieved higher silage quality at 25% DM than 15% DM. The different LAB inoculants result in significant differences in silage quality, while W. cibaria decreased the pH and inhibited the growth of undesirable bacteria and those characteristics were not affected by the DM content.

AB Background: Elymus L. is the largest genus in the Triticeae tribe. Most species in this genus are highly stress resistant, with excellent forage value. Elymus breviaristatus, a rare species endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), is declining due to habitat fragmentation. However, genetic data for E. breviaristatus are limited, with expressed sequence tag (EST) markers being particularly rare, hampering genetic studies and protection measures. Results: We obtained 9.06 Gb clean sequences from the transcriptome of E. breviaristatus, generating 171,522 unigenes, which were assembled and functionally annotated against five public databases. We identified 30,668 SSRs in the E. breviaristatus transcriptome, from which 103 EST-SSR primer pairs were randomly selected. Of these, 58 pairs of amplified products of the expected size, and 18 of the amplified products were polymorphic. Model-based Bayesian clustering, the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA), and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of 179 wild E. breviaristatus in 12 populations using these EST-SSRs were generally consistent, grouping the 12 populations into two major clades. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) found 70% of the genetic variation among the 12 populations and 30% within the populations, indicating a high level of genetic differentiation (or low gene exchange) among the 12 populations. The transferability of the 58 successful EST-SSR primers to 22 related hexaploid species was 86.2-98.3%. UPGMA analysis generally grouped species with similar genome types together. Conclusions: Here, we developed EST-SSR markers from the transcriptome of E. breviaristatus. The transferability of these markers was evaluated, and the genetic structure and diversity of E. breviaristatus were explored. Our results provide a basis for the conservation and management of this endangered species, and the obtained molecular markers represent valuable resources for the exploration of genetic relationships among species in the Elymus genus.

TI Effect of Chinese Currency Appreciation on Investments in Renewable

ID FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; MODEL
AB Foreign investment in renewable energy generation projects is a critical part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Under the background of the market economy, the electric energy will participate in power market competition among the countries along the line, and the sales revenue will be settled in the local currency. The exchange rate of the countries along the Belt and Road fluctuates frequently and widely, thereby posing significant risks to the investment income of the projects. To address this problem, this paper proposes the concept of Ek as the effective exchange rate expressed by the on-grid price, investment cost per kilowatt electricity generation equipment, and annual operating cost rate of unit power generation capacity. Moreover, this paper presents a model of power generation cost, income, and earning expressed by the real exchange rate. The flexibility formula of the fluctuation of power generation cost, income, profit, and internal rate of return relative(IRR) to Ek is derived, and the effect of exchange rate level and fluctuation on projects is analyzed. With the wind power projects invested by China in Pakistan taken as an example, the trend during the entire life cycle is calculated. The changes in net profit rate, IRR, and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) are calculated under Chinese currency appreciation of 10%, 20%, and 35% and 5% and 10% reduction of investment cost per unit. As the Chinese currency appreciates and the project IRR declines significantly, LCOE decreases slightly, but this decrease is not sufficient to compensate for the losses caused by the decline in IRR. The following effective measures are proposed to deal with the exchange rate fluctuation of foreign renewable energy generation projects: building energy Internet, reducing project cost, and using Chinese currency as the settlement currency. In this paper, a solution is provided for investments in renewable energy projects in regions where exchange rates fluctuate greatly.

ID VACCINATION; PROTECTION
AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an acute contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, pigs, and sheep. Current emergency FMD vaccines are of limited use for early protection because their protective effect starts 7 days after vaccination. Therefore, antiviral drugs or additives are used to rapidly stop the spread of the virus during FMD outbreaks. Manganese (Mn2+) was recently found to be an important substance necessary for the host to protect against DNA viruses. However, its antiviral effect against RNA viruses remains unknown. In this study, we found that Mn2+ has antiviral effects on the FMD virus (FMDV) both in PK15 cells and mice. The inhibitory effect of Mn2+ on FMDV involves NF-kappa B activation and up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes. Animal experiments showed that Mn2+ can be highly effective in protecting C57BL/6N mice from being infected with FMDV. Overall, we suggest Mn2+ as an effective antiviral additive for controlling FMDV infection.

AB BackgroundThe procession of preadipocytes differentiation into mature adipocytes involves multiple cellular and signal transduction pathways. Recently. a seirces of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including circular RNAs (circRNAs) were proved to play important roles in regulating differentiation of adipocytes.ResultIn this study, we aimed to identificate the potential circRNAs in the early and late stages of goat intramuscular adipocytes differentiation. Using bioinformatics methods to predict their biological functions and map the circRNA-miRNA interaction network. Over 104 million clean reads in goat intramuscular preadipocytes and adipocytes were mapped, of which16 circRNAs were differentially expressed (DE-circRNAs). Furthermore, we used real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) technology to randomly detect the expression levels of 8 circRNAs among the DE-circRNAs, and our result verifies the accuracy of the RNA-seq data. From the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the DE-circRNAs, two circRNAs, circ_0005870 and circ_0000946, were found in Focal adhesion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Then we draw the circRNA-miRNA interaction network and obtained the miRNAs that possibly interact with circ_0005870 and circ_0000946. Using TargetScan, miRTarBase and miR-TCDS online databases, we further obtained the mRNAs that may interact with the miRNAs, and generated the final circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network. Combined with the following GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG enrichment analysis, we obtained 5 key mRNAs related to adipocyte differentiation in our interaction network, which are FOXO3(forkhead box O3), PPP2CA (protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha), EEIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4), CDK6 (cyclin dependent kinase 6) and ACVR1 (activin A receptor type 1).ConclusionsBy using Illumina HiSeq and online databases, we generated the final circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network that have valuable functions in adipocyte differentiation. Our work serves as a valuable genomic resource for in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanism of ncRNAs interaction network regulating adipocyte differentiation.

AB Heavy metals elements are not only related to the functions of ecosystems but also affect human health. To understand the characteristics of heavy metals in the topsoil of the Zoige alpine basin, a total of 252 grass and topsoil samples were collected in May and September 2014. The results showed that only Cd and Pb highly exceeded their background values (BV); in May and September, Cd was 2.02- and 1.55-fold higher than its BV, respectively, and Pb was 2.35- and 2.17-fold above its BV, respectively. The sources of Cd and Pb were homologous. In addition, the comprehensive potential ecological risk index was less than 150, indicating that heavy metal pollution in the study area is currently low. The spatial interpolation indicated that Cd and Pb pollution might be related to tourism and transportation, but the low biological absorption coefficient for all heavy metals showed that heavy metal absorption ability of forage was low and would not impact yak breeding. Finally, the soil was lightly contaminated by Cd and Pb due to the rapid development of the animal husbandry and tourism. The spatial variation of heavy metal in the basin is dominated by structural factors, and the random factors also have an effect on spatial distribution of As, Cd, Cu and Ni. The random factors such as overgrazing can exert an influence on physical structure and the circulation of nutrient substances of meadow soil through livestock grazing and trampling, ultimately affecting the content and distribution of soil heavy metals.

AB Kengyilia hirsuta is an important pioneer plant distributed on the desertified grassland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has strong adaptability to alpine desert habitats, so it can be used as a sand-fixing plant on sandy alpine land. To study the response mechanisms of root morphological and physiological characteristics of K. hirsuta to sandy soil moisture, 10%, 25% and 40% moisture levels were set up through potted weighing water control method. The biomass, root-shoot ratio, root architecture parameters, and biochemical parameters malondialdehyde, free proline, soluble protein, indole-3-acetic acid, abscisic acid, cytokinin, gibberellin, relative conductivity and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in the trefoil stage, and the response mechanisms of roots at different moisture levels were analyzed. The results showed that with the increase of soil moisture, root morphological indexes such as root biomass, total root length, total root volume and total root surface increased, while the root topological index decreased continuously. The malondialdehyde content, relative conductivity, superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, catalase activity, free proline content, soluble protein content, abscisic acid content and cytokinin content at the 25% and 40% moisture levels were significantly decreased compared with the 10% level (P< 0.05). Thus, the root growth of K. hirsuta was restricted by the 10% moisture level, but supported by the 25% and 40% moisture levels. An artificial neural network revealed that total root length, total root surface area, root link average length, relative conductivity, soluble protein, free proline and moisture level were the key factors affecting root development. These research results could contribute to future agricultural sustainability.

AB Forty-eight male Lezhi black goat kids with similar body weight ((12.09 +/- 1.70) kg) and age ((60 +/- 5) d) were used to determine the effect of dietary copper (Cu), in the form of reagent grade Cu sulfate (CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O), on performance, serum lipid profile, and the relative mRNA abundance of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Goat kids were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups. Each treatment consisted of 12 replicate pens with each pen containing one goat kid. Treatment groups received the basal diet with no supplemental Cu (control), basal diet plus 10 mg of Cu kg(-1) of dry matter (DM), basal diet plus 20 mg of Cu kg(-1) of DM, or basal diet plus 30 mg of Cu kg(-1) of DM. Goats were housed individually in pens and fed a high-concentrate pelleted diet for 60 d. Average daily gain, average daily feed intake and feed:gain of goats were not affected by dietary Cu supplementation (P>0.10). No differences were detected in serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations of goat kids fed with different Cu concentrations (P>0.05). However, serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased linearly (P=0.01) as the concentration of dietary Cu increased. Intramuscular fat content of longissimus muscle increased (P=0.002) quadratically and liver Cu concentrations increased (P<0.001) linearly as dietary Cu concentration increased. Compared with the control, dietary supplementation of 20 mg Cu kg(-1) DM decreased the relative mRNA abundance of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (P=0.01) and lipoprotein lipase (P=0.05), and tended to decrease the relative mRNA abundance of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (P=0.06) in longissimus muscle of goats. The relative mRNA abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (P<0.001), carnitine acetyltransferase (P=0.001), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (P=0.001) were also decreased in liver by Cu supplementation. These results indicate that dietary supplementation of Cu modified lipid metabolism by increasing muscular fat and decreasing serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the modification might be associated with the reduction of relative mRNA abundance of genes for oxidation of long-chain fatty acid in muscle and liver of Lezhi black goat kids.

ID KEYWORD GUESSING ATTACKS; AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION; SECURITY
AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) collects a large amount of data through various types of sensors and intelligently processes this data using cloud computing, which is flexible, efficient, and cost-effective. Since IIoT data is stored on the cloud service provider's server, the data must be encrypted to protect the user's privacy. However, the encrypted data faces the search problem, which is usually solved by Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS). In addition, most existing PEKS schemes are vulnerable to Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA). Recently, some certificateless public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (CLPEKS) schemes have been proposed, which not only avoid the problems of certificate management and key escrow but can also resist IKGA. However, most of them rely on the expensive bilinear pairing. To overcome these problems, in this paper we propose a pairing-free CLPEKS scheme. The security of the proposed scheme is proved in the random oracle model. The analysis results show that the proposed scheme has better overall performance in terms of computational cost, communication cost and security properties.

AB The acquisition of innovation performance through social network relationship resources is a common behavior pattern of organizational members. Recent social network research suggests that negative ties may also have a positive impact on organizational innovation compared with positive ties. Based on this, the paper investigates the impact of dissonant tie, which are a combination of problem-solving tie and difficult working tie, on organizational innovation. The empirical results show that dissonant tie promotes organizational innovation performance and are enhanced by digital sensing and digital seizing, while the increasing effect of the dissonant tie on organizational innovation performance is not verified under the moderating effect of digital reconfiguring. The findings are useful for understanding why certain negative ties may promote organizational innovation and performance, and to provide a theoretical basis for how manufacturing companies can use complex social network ties to survive organizational change and enhance organizational adaptability in digital transformation.

AB Windows have a great impact on building energy consumption, and the thermal performance of window frames directly affects its energy-saving potential. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to optimize the thermal performance of commercially available broken-bridge aluminum window frames, by incorporating radiant insulation panels (RIPs) into the window frame cavity. A typical aluminum alloy window frame heat transfer model is theoretically analyzed and validated, and the effects of key design parameters on the equivalent thermal conductivity (ETC) of the cavity radiation heat transfer and the heat transfer coefficient (U-factor) of window frames are quantitatively analyzed by a finite element simulation method using the THERM software. Moreover, the RIP, the insulation material filling, and low surface emissivity on the thermal performance of the window frame are compared and analyzed. The results show that the RIP is better placed in the middle, the width and quantity of RIPs are negatively correlated with the U-factor, while the surface emissivity of RIPs is positively correlated with the U-factor. Adding RIPs in the cavity can reduce the U-factor of the window frame by more than 7.43%, slightly lower than 8.97% for the filling type, but significantly higher than 0.81% for the low-emissivity type. Inserting RIPs is a simple and effective way to reduce the U-factor of the window frame and have a great potential of use.

AB The issue of leader-following identical consensus for nonlinear Markov jump multi-agent systems (NMJMASs) under deception attacks (DAs) or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks is investigated in this paper. The Bernoulli random variable is introduced to describe whether the controller is injected with false data, that is, whether the systems are subjected to DAs. A connectivity recovery mechanism is constructed to maintain the connection among multi-agents when the systems are subjected to DoS attack. The impulsive control strategy is adopted to ensure that the systems can normally work under DAs or DoS attacks. Based on graph theory, Lyapunov stability theory, and impulsive theory, using the Lyapunov direct method and stochastic analysis method, the sufficient conditions of identical consensus for Markov jump multi-agent systems (MJMASs) under DAs or DoS are obtained, respectively. Finally, the correctness of the results and the effectiveness of the method are verified by two numerical examples.

AB Hyperuricaemic nephropathy (HN) is a common clinical complication of hyperuricaemia (HUA) and poses a huge threat to human health. Hence, we aimed to prospectively investigate the dysregulated genes, pathways and networks involved in HN by performing whole transcriptome sequencing using RNA sequencing. Six kidney samples from HN group (n = 3) and a control group (n = 3) were obtained to conduct RNA sequencing. To disclose the relevant signalling pathways, we conducted the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. A competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was established to reveal the interactions between lncRNAs, circRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs and investigate the potential mechanisms of HN. Ultimately, 2250 mRNAs, 306 lncRNAs, 5 circRNAs, and 70 miRNAs were determined to be significantly differentially expressed in the HN group relative to the control group. We further authenticated 8 differentially expressed (DE)-ncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and these findings were in accordance with the sequencing results. The analysis results evidently showed that these DE-ncRNAs were significantly enriched in pathways related to inflammatory reaction. In conclusion, HUA may generate abnormal gene expression changes and regulate signalling pathways in kidney samples. Potentially related genes and pathways involved in HN were identified.

AB Elymus breviaristatus, a rare grass species with excellent resistance and ecological importance, is narrowly distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Populations of E. breviaristatus are declining due to habitat fragmentation, and thus far, characteristics of genetic differentiation and adaptive responses to climate change remain poorly understood in this species. Here, we explored the genetic structure of 18 natural populations (269 individuals) in the transition zone between Tibet and the Hengduan Mountains using 15 expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR primer pairs and identified possible barriers to gene flow that might have caused genetic discontinuities. Additional analyses were performed to identify the environmental factors affecting genetic diversity and to test whether the patterns of genetic variation among populations were more consistent with the isolation by distance (IBD) or isolation by environment (IBE) model. Multiple measures of genetic diversity revealed that intra-population genetic variation was low, while inter-population genetic variation was high. Clustering, structure, and principal coordinate analyses identified three genetic groups: (a) Eastern Qamdo, (b) Nagqu and Western Qamdo, and (c) Lhasa and Nyingchi. A clear physical barrier to gene flow was formed by the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon and the Tanggula Mountains. We found that both IBD and IBE contributed to the observed patterns of genetic variation, and the IBE model played a leading role. In addition, precipitation-related variables, soil phosphorus content and soil K:P ratio significantly affected population genetic variation. Overall, our results emphasized the genetic fragility of E. breviaristatus populations and showed that this species requires attention, as future climate changes and human activities may further threaten its survival. In addition, the genetic differences among E. breviaristatus populations should be considered when formulating conservation measures for E. breviaristatus populations in the study area.

AB Polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) is a novel high-performance engineering plastic with various applications, particularly in thermoresistance-required fields. In this study, a well-known stimuli-response polydiacetylene monomer, 10, 12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA), was encapsulated within electrospun PEN nanofibers to fabricate a colorimetric membrane with satisfactory thermal and corrosion resistance. To optimize the compatibility with PCDA, two PENswith distinct molecular chains were utilized: PEN-PPL and PEN-BPA. The chemical structure and elemental mapping analysis revealed that the PCDA component was successfully incorporated into the PEN fibrous. The PCDA bound significantly better to the PEN-PPL than to the PEN-BPA; due to the carboxyl groups present on the side chains of PEN-PPL, the surface was smooth and the color changed uniformly as the temperature rose. However, owing to its poor compatibility with PEN-BPA, the PCDA formed agglomerations on the fibers. The thermal analysis demonstrated that the membranes obtained after PCDA compounding maintained their excellent heat resistance. The 5% weight loss temperatures of composite nanofibrous membranes manufactured by PEN-PPL and PEN-BPA were 402 degrees C and 506 degrees C, respectively, and their glass transition temperatures were 219 degrees C and 169 degrees C, respectively, indicating that the blended membranes can withstand high temperatures. The evaluation of application performance revealed that the composite membranes exhibited good dimensional stability upon high thermal and corrosive situations. Specifically, the PEN-P-PCDA did not shrink at 170 degrees C. Both composite membranes were dimensionally stable when exposed to the alkali aqueous solution. However, PEN-P-PCDA is more sensitive to OH-, exhibiting color transition at pH > 8, whereas PEN-B-PCDA exhibited color transition at high OH- concentrations (pH >= 13), with enhanced alkali resistance stability owing to its nanofibrous architecture. This exploratory study reveals the feasibility of PEN nanofibers functionalized using PCDA as a desirable stimulus-response sensor even in high-temperature and corrosive harsh environments.

AB A metavirome analysis was performed and detected bopivirus in the diarrhoeal fecal samples of goats in China. A total of 136 fecal samples were collected from yeanlings between the dates of June 2021 and January 2022 in Sichuan province, China. Moreover, "Bopivirus B" strains were detected by a specific RT-PCR targeting the 3D gene of the virus. The results showed that the overall detection rate of "Bopivirus B" was 19.12% (26/136). Additionally, there was a higher detection rate (24.05%, 19/79) in the fecal samples collected from yeanlings with diarrhea compared to those from asymptomatic animals (12.28%, 7/57). In these samples, no other common diarrhea-causing pathogens were detected except for three enteric viruses, namely caprine enterovirus, caprine kobuvirus and caprine hunnivirus (with detection rates of 13.97, 13.97, and 8.82%, respectively). Subsequently, full-length VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1 genes from "Bopivirus B"-positive samples were amplified, cloned, sequenced, and analyzed. The phylogenetic analysis performed on the VP1 genes revealed that the identified bopivirus belonged to genotype B1 (seven strains) and B2 (three strains) and presented a high genetic diversity. Furthermore, a complete genome sequence of a "Bopivirus B" strain (SWUN/B1/2022) was obtained using PCR from fecal sample of a diarrhoeal yeanling. The complete genome was 7,309 nucleotides in length with a standard picornavirus genome organization, and shares 93.10% and 91.10% nucleotide similarity with bopivirus B1 genotype strain ovine/TB14/2010-HUN and bopivirus B2 genotype strain goat/AGK16/2020-HUN, respectively. According to the species classification criteria put forward by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and VP1 genotype, the strain SWUN/B1/2022 belongs to the bopivirus B1. This strain has unique amino acid substitutions in the VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1 genes. Moreover, genomic recombination analysis revealed that this strain may be a minor parental strain of bopivirus B1 ovine/TB14/2010-HUN. Evolutionary analysis based on the 2C and 3CD genes revealed that the new bopivirus B1 strain SWUN/B1/2022 presents a unique evolutionary pattern. This study provided evidence to suggest that "Bopivirus B" is circulating with substantial genetic diversity in goats in China at present, and the mixed infection of "Bopivirus B" with other enteric viruses should be considered to be a composite factor in the occurrence of viral diarrhea in goats.

AB Lead-free potassium sodium niobate (KNN) ceramics have become crucial advanced functional materials with conspicuous performance. Although continuous improvements of electrical properties were achieved via various strategies these years, the poor stability leads to the bottleneck for application. Herein, the stability of electrical properties under different conditions (i. e. electric field, frequency and temperature) were emphasized on in KNN-based ceramics with addition of oxides based on the availability for optimizing properties. With addition of Fe2O3, high ferroelectric, piezoelectric and dielectric properties remain due to the maintained rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary at room temperature and little changed Curie temperature (TC), while deterioration happens with excess Fe2O3 attributing to the pinning effect from replacement of Fe3+ in crystal lattice. Furthermore, the elevated beginning electric field for stable ferroelectricity and negative strain under increasing electric field are gained with elevating Fe2O3 along with little changed piezoelectricity. Stable strain maintains with increasing frequencies when Fe2O3 content changes, as an enhancement are discovered for residual polarization (Pr) and coercive electric field (EC) at 0.5-1 Hz for x >= 1.0%. Moreover, improved temperature stability for piezoelectricity and strain as well as remained high ferroelectricity is presented with increasing Fe2O3, originating from the increasing dif-fusion behavior of R-O-T phase boundary and non-declined TC, respectively. Thus, this work provides an effectively strategy to optimize the stability of electrical properties for application of KNN-based materials.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hybrid male sterility (HMS) is a reproductive isolation mechanism limiting the formation of fertile offspring through interspecific fertilization. Cattleyak is the interspecific hybrid presenting significant heterosis in several economic traits, but HMS restricted its wide reproduction in cettleyak breeding. In this study, we detected the specifically expressed genes of a variety of cells (undifferentiated spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, haploid spermatids, sperm, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and macrophages) in the testis of yak and cattleyak, and found that the spermatogenesis of cattleyak might be blocked at meiosis I, and the expression of niche factors (NR5A1, GATA4, STAR, CYP11A1, CD68, TNF, and CX3CR1) in undifferentiated spermatogonia niche was abnormal. Then we isolated the undifferentiated spermatogonia and Sertoli cells from yak and cattleyak by enzyme digestion, and detected the specific genes in the two bovid testicular cells as well as the proliferation capacity of the undifferentiated spermatogonia. These results indicated that weak proliferation ability and scarce number of undifferentiated spermatogonia and abnormal gene expressions in Sertoli cells may contribute to male sterility of cattleyak.

AB The development of highly sensitive gas sensors is of great significance to the environment and human health. In this work, we demonstrate the enhancement of the gas-sensing performance of ZnO via employing disorder surface. The random arrangement of surface atoms could give rise to a coarse surface for improving gas adsorption. Moreover, due to the absence of carrier diffusion in amorphous layer, the Anderson localization could restrict the carrier interaction. Most crucially, the electron localization led by lattice disorder significantly elevate the gas monitoring sensitivity. As a result, the acetone sensitivity of ZnO is greatly enhanced (up to similar to 20.8 times compared with the pristine sample). This work theoretically and experimentally investigate the role of surface disorder in enhancing gas-sensing performance, and also present a mild, low-cost method to modify the material for further applications.

AB Background: This study is to investigate the role of 12-Epi-Napelline, a new alkaloid isolated from aconitum, in promoting the paracrine of Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMSCs) and the synergistic therapeutic effects on osteoarthritis.Method: We tested the cytotoxicity and optimization of 12-Epi-Napelline, and then simulated the osteoarthritis model in vitro damaging the chondrocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and RT-qPCR, Western blot and Immunofluorescence were used to detect the inflammatory factor IL-1 beta, COX-2, TNF-alpha, MMP-13 and anabolic cytokines of Col-2, BMP-2, TGF-beta 1 and Sox9 expression in chondrocytes after 12-Epi-Napelline treatment. Under the treatment of different time, Col-2, BMP-2, TGF-beta 1 and Sox9 expression in BMSCs were detected by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and Immunofluorescence. By establishing an osteoarthritis model in vivo, the anti-osteoarthritis effect of 12-Epi-Napelline or BMSCs was evaluated.Results: The results showed the expressions of IL-1 beta, COX-2, TNF-alpha, and MMP-13 were down-regulated in chondrocytes after 12-Epi-Napelline treatment, while the expression of Col-2, BMP-2, TGF-beta 1 and Sox9 were increased to normal chondrocytes. These increased expression also occurred in BMSCs. BMSCs had the trend of transforming into chondrocytes by regulating TGF-beta signaling pathway under the treatment of 12-Epi-Napelline.Conclusion: This study could confirm that 12-Epi-Napelline is not only effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, but also can induce BMSCs to secrete growth factors that promote chondrocyte repair to help repair the damage caused by osteoarthritis.

AB Periphyton has important ecological functions. It can even exist in environments with strong ultraviolet radia-tion. However, knowledge of periphyton under ultraviolet is limited, which limits the understanding and application of periphyton in environments with high ultraviolet radiation. In this study, immature periphyton (IMP) and mature periphyton (MP) under ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation were investigated and compared in terms of physiological characteristics and bacterial community. Analysis of the physiological characteristics showed that the response patterns of IMP and MP to UVB were similar. IMP and MP could adapt to UVB of 1 W/ m2 well. However, high-intensity UVB (2 and 3 W/m2) reduced the periphyton biomass, inhibited photosynthesis and antioxidant enzyme activity and caused severe lipid peroxidation in both IMP and MP. Integrated Biological Response (IBR) analysis and toxicological model fitting showed that the ED50 values of UVB for IMP and MP were 1.25 and 1.50 W/m2, respectively. 16 S rRNA gene analysis showed that in both IMP and MP, bacterial com-munity composition, assembly and function were affected by UVB. In addition, the response of the bacterial community in IMP to UVB was stronger than that in MP. The diversity of the IMP community was inhibited by UVB, but that of the MP community was not. Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus are key microorganisms responsible for tolerance to UVB stress. Neutral community model fitting showed that both UVB and the development process caused the determinism of bacterial succession. However, UVB may weaken the deter-ministic process caused by development. Functional prediction showed that many metabolic functions of periphyton were inhibited by UVB in IMP and MP. However, UVB caused different changes (enhancement or inhibition) of some ecological functions in them. This study provides valuable information for understanding periphyton in environments with UVB radiation, which may be used to improve the application of periphyton in these environments.

AB DNA methylation modification can regulate gene expression without changing the genome sequence, which helps organisms to rapidly adapt to new environments. However, few studies have been reported in non-model mammals. Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a flagship species for global biodiversity conservation. Wildness and reintroduction of giant pandas are the important content of giant pandas' protection. However, it is unclear how wildness training affects the epigenetics of giant pandas, and we lack the means to assess the adaptive capacity of wildness training giant pandas. We comparatively analyzed genome-level methylation differences in captive giant pandas with and without wildness training to determine whether methylation modification played a role in the adaptive response of wildness training pandas. The whole genome DNA methylation sequencing results showed that genomic cytosine methylation ratio of all samples was 5.35%-5.49%, and the methylation ratio of the CpG site was the highest. Differential methylation analysis identified 544 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). The results of KEGG pathway enrichment of DMGs showed that VAV3, PLCG2, TEC and PTPRC participated in multiple immune-related pathways, and may participate in the immune response of wildness training giant pandas by regulating adaptive immune cells. A large number of DMGs enriched in GO terms may also be related to the regulation of immune activation during wildness training of giant pandas. Promoter differentially methylation analysis identified 1,199 genes with differential methylation at promoter regions. Genes with low methylation level at promoter regions and high expression such as, CCL5, P2Y13, GZMA, ANP32A, VWF, MYOZ1, NME7, MRPS31 and TPM1 were important in environmental adaptation for wildness training giant pandas. The methylation and expression patterns of these genes indicated that wildness training giant pandas have strong immunity, blood coagulation, athletic abilities and disease resistance. The adaptive response of giant pandas undergoing wildness training may be regulated by their negatively related promoter methylation. We are the first to describe the DNA methylation profile of giant panda blood tissue and our results indicated methylation modification is involved in the adaptation of captive giant pandas when undergoing wildness training. Our study also provided potential monitoring indicators for the successful reintroduction of valuable and threatened animals to the wild.

AB The goal of software defect prediction is to make predictions by mining the historical data using models. Current software defect prediction models mainly focus on the code features of software modules. However, they ignore the connection between software modules. This paper proposed a software defect prediction framework based on graph neural network from a complex network perspective. Firstly, we consider the software as a graph, where nodes represent the classes, and edges represent the dependencies between the classes. Then, we divide the graph into multiple subgraphs using the community detection algorithm. Thirdly, the representation vectors of the nodes are learned through the improved graph neural network model. Lastly, we use the representation vector of node to classify the software defects. The proposed model is tested on the PROMISE dataset, using two graph convolution methods, based on the spectral domain and spatial domain in the graph neural network. The investigation indicated that both convolution methods showed an improvement in various metrics, such as accuracy, F-measure, and MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) by 86.6%, 85.8%, and 73.5%, and 87.5%, 85.9%, and 75.5%, respectively. The average improvement of various metrics was noted as 9.0%, 10.5%, and 17.5%, and 6.3%, 7.0%, and 12.1%, respectively, compared with the benchmark models.

AB As an important livelihood strategy choice to promote the sustainable development of themselves and regions, returnees' entrepreneurship has played a vital role in the governance of all-level Chinese local governments since the 21st century. The policy attention reflects the importance that the local governments attach to this issue, and the evolution process also reflects relevant policies' internal rules and characteristics. Based on this, this paper, taking 242 policy texts related to returnees' entrepreneurship issued by local governments from 2000 to 2021 as the research objects, uses grounded theory and social network analysis in order to explore the policy attention evolution from the aspects of time, space, specific policy domains and cooperative relationship among policy subjects. Finally, this research finds the main conclusions as follows: (1) The policy attention evolution on time dimension has the characteristic of synchronism, different levels and "reciprocal U". (2) The policy attention evolution on space dimension is closely linked to "pull" and "push" forces of local population flow and has neighborhood effects. (3) The policy attention evolution on specific policy areas will gradually spread and diversify with the change in local governance environment and stage goals. (4) The evolution trend of collaborative social network among policy objects has the characteristic of "loose-central-loose".

AB Lipidic metabolites play essential roles in host physiological health and growth performance, serving as the major structural and signaling components of membranes, energy storage molecules, and steroid hormones. Bamboo, as wild giant pandas' exclusive diet, is the main determinant of giant pandas' lipidome, both as a direct source and through microbiota activity. Interestingly, the consumption of bamboo has attracted little attention from a lipidomic perspective. In the current study, we outline the lipidomic atlas of different parts of bamboo. By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we have been able to obtain the absolute quantification of 35 fatty acids pertaining to short chain fatty acids (8), medium chain fatty acids (6), long chain fatty acids (17), and very long chain fatty acids (4), while liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) allowed us to obtain the relative quantification of another 1638 lipids. Among the fatty acids quantified in absolute terms, eight showed significantly distinct concentrations among different bamboo parts. Subsequently, we investigated how the giant panda's serum and fecal lipidome adapt to the most important annual change in their diet, represented by the consumption of high amounts of bamboo shoots, typical of spring, the weight-gaining season. Five fatty acids were significantly altered in feces and two in serum, respectively, due to the different levels of bamboo shoot consumption. Furthermore, significant differences of the main bacteria strains were observed in feces between the two groups at the genus level, pertaining to Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Vagococcus. Correlations between giant panda fecal microbiome and lipidome were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. These findings suggest that a balanced diet, important for the overall lipidomic function and giant panda health, could be reached even in this remarkable case of a single food-based diet, by administering to the giant panda's combinations of different parts of bamboo, with specific lipidome profiles.

AB Rh is recently regarded as the promising electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation into CO2 due to its high activity of splitting C-C bond, whereas the further oxidation of as-generated C1 species (CO and CHx) is pretty sluggish at Rh surface. To solve this, here the oxophile Pb skin-layer is inhabited at Rh nanoparticles to obtain the Pb@Rh core-shell structure with controllable Pb coverage (qPb), expecting to tune the surface reactivity of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood Mechanism as well as the strain effect. Fortunately, the as-obtained Pb@Rh/C catalysts indeed significantly enhance the catalysis performance of EOR, the optimal mass activity is ca. 1450 mA mg-1 metal when qPb is ca. 0.53 (Pb0.53@Rh), being ca. 13 times higher than pristine Rh catalyst. Meanwhile, as much as ca. 57% of the initial EOR current remains even after a 20,000-s durability mea-surement. And the apparent C1 pathway faraday efficiency (CO2 selectivity) is also esti-mated to be ca. 21% at Pb0.53@Rh surface. This work can provide a simple and promising protocol to tune the surface reactivity by interfacial engineering manipulation.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Numerous cutting-edge studies have confirmed that the slow accumulation of cell cycle arrested and secretory cells, called senescent cells (SCs), in tissues is an important negative factor, or even the culprit, in age-associated diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and malignant tumors. With further understanding of cellular senescence, SCs are important effective targets for the treatment of senescence-related diseases, called the Senotherapy. However, existing therapies, including Senolytics (which lyse SCs) and Senostatic (which regulate senescence-associated secretory phenotype), do not have the properties to target SCs, and side effects due to non-specific distribution are one of the hindrances to clinical use of Senotherapy. In the past few decades, targeted delivery has attracted much attention and been developed as a recognized diagnostic and therapeutic novel tool, due to the advantages of visualization of targets, more accurate drug/gene delivery, and ultimately "reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy". Despite considerable advances in achieving targeted delivery, it has not yet been widely used in Senotherapy. In this review, we clarify the challenge for Senotherapy, then discuss how different targeted strategies contribute to imaging or therapy for SCs in terms of different biomarkers of SCs.

AB The use of articulate-filtering facemasks (hereinafter referred to as facemasks) as a defensive measure to reduce air pollution exposure has not been adopted by the Chinese public. Our descriptive investigation reveals hidden barriers other than facemask expenditure that determine the choice to use facemasks. Whether discomfort or inconvenience are the major sources of inaction is largely unknown. By conducting a choice experiment, we observed how people made trade-offs between the costs and health benefits of facemask use in monetary terms, defined as willingness to pay (WTP). The results first demonstrated that discomfort and inconvenience majorly account for the inaction of facemask use, as they are, on average, valuated 6.94 and 24.00 times the facemask expenditures for year 2017 and 2022, respectively. Second, we estimated the threshold of lung cancer mortality above which the cost of facemask use weighs less than the health benefits, which implies a trigger point of health protection behavior. Third, we predicted, in the contexts of air pollution in 2017 and 2021 at the city level, that people refused to wear facemasks if they perceived lung cancer mortality as the one presented in current sci-entific assessments. We suggested the need to study the subjective reality of public defensive measures if the objectives of air quality and, more generally, environmental management are to be achieved.

AB DNA cytosine methylation modification in the germline is of particular importance since it is a highly heritable epigenetic mark. Although cytosine methylation has been analyzed at the genome-scale for several mammalian species, our knowledge of DNA methylation patterns and the mechanisms under-lying male hybrid sterility is still limited in domestic animals such as cattleyak. Here we for the first time show the genome-wide and single-base resolution landscape of methylcytosines (mC) in the primary spermatocyte (PSC) genome of yak with normal spermatogenesis and the inter-specific hybrid cattleyak with male infertility. A comparative investigation revealed that widespread differences are observed in the composition and patterning of DNA cytosine methylation between the two methylomes. Global CG or non-CG DNA methylation levels, as well as the number of mC sites, are increased in cattleyak compared to yak. Notably, the DNA methylome in cattleyak PSC exhibits promoter hypermethylation of meiosis -specific genes and piRNA pathway genes with respect to yak. Furthermore, major retrotransposonson classes are predominantly hypermethylated in cattleyak while those are fully hypomethylated in yak. KEGG pathway enrichment indicates Rap1 signaling and MAPK pathways may play potential roles in the spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak. Our present study not only provides valuable insights into distinct features of the cattleyak PSC methylome but also paves the way toward elucidating the complex, yet highly coordinated epigenetic modification during male germline development for inter-specific hybrid animals.

By first-principles calculations with density functional theory, their structure, phase stability, elastic properties, electronic properties, and thermal properties have been further investigated. Results show that they are all energetic, thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Debye temperature were computed to discuss their elastic and thermal properties. Results show that they are all good ductile materials with high melting points. Density of states and electron localization function of these three phases were presented to research the chemical bonds and explore the reason limiting their melting points.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the potential application of a mixed-mode solar dryer to Qula dehydration in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. A three-factor five-level central composite rotatable design (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to evaluate the influences of drying process variables on quality attributes in terms of lipid oxidation [peroxide (POV) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS)] and Maillard reaction (5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 5-HMF). The impact of drying temperature (30-50 degrees C), material thickness (5-15 mm), and wind velocity (0.4-1.4 m/s) on the color, POV, TBARS, and 5-HMF of Qula were studied. Optimum operating conditions were found to be a temperature of 43.0 degrees C, material thickness of 11.0 mm, and wind velocity of 1.0 m/s based on the minimum of POV, TBARS, and 5-HMF. In this condition, the values of POV, TBARS, and 5-HMF were 0.65 meq/kg, 0.516 mg/kg, and 4.586 mg water/L, respectively, which are significantly lower than for drying of Qula by open sun-drying (p < 0.05). Compared with open sun-drying, the drying time of Qula by solar drying was shortened by 61.5%. The results indicate that the mixed-mode solar dryer is a feasibility drying technology for Qula and could effectively improve the quality of products.

AB Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a 17 kDa calcium-binding protein associated with numerous inflam-matory diseases. The full-length cDNA of AIF-1 has been identified in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus in our previous study, and it was assumed to be a novel molecule involved in immune responses. To clarify this aspect, the level of AIF-1 expression was amplified and reduced in grass carp peripheral blood leukocytes via transfection of vector pcDNA3.1-AIF1-EGFP and pLKO.1-shRNA-EGFP-puro, respectively. Thereafter, AIF-1 stimulated cell proliferation, inhibited cell apoptosis, which might benefit from improved mitochondrial function as evidenced by increased mitochondrial membrane potential, subsequently promoted ATP production. In addition, AIF-1 induced leukocyte migration via up-regulated monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1) secretion, enhanced neutral red uptake into leukocyte, provoked pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 113 (IL113), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8) and suppressed anti-inflammatory cytokine inter-leukin 10 (IL10) production. These results indicated AIF-1 played a critical role in grass carp innate immune system.

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
AB In LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite communication systems, the satellite network is made up of a large number of satellites, the dynamically changing network environment affects the results of distributed computing. In order to improve the fault tolerance rate, a novel public blockchain consensus mechanism that applies a distributed computing architecture in a public network is proposed. Redundant calculation of blockchain ensures the credibility of the results; and the transactions with calculation results of a task are stored distributed in sequence in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). The transactions issued by nodes are connected to form a net. The net can quickly provide node reputation evaluation that does not rely on third parties. Simulations show that our proposed blockchain has the following advantages: 1. The task processing speed of the blockchain can be close to that of the fastest node in the entire blockchain; 2. When the tasks' arrival time intervals and demanded working nodes(WNs) meet certain conditions, the network can tolerate more than 50% of malicious devices; 3. No matter the number of nodes in the blockchain is increased or reduced, the network can keep robustness by adjusting the task's arrival time interval and demanded WNs.

AB One of the distinct hallmarks of cancer cells is aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is thought to play a key role in aerobic glycolysis and has been extensively studied, while lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC), an isoform of LDHA, has received much less attention. Here we showed that human LDHC was significantly expressed in lung cancer tissues, overexpression of Ldhc in mice could promote tumor growth, and knock-down of LDHC could inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells. We solved the first crystal structure of human LDHC4 and found that the active-site loop of LDHC4 adopted a distinct conformation compared to LDHA4 and lactate dehydrogenase B4 (LDHB4). Moreover, we found that (ethylamino) (oxo)acetic acid shows about 10 times selective inhi-bition against LDHC4 over LDHA4 and LDHB4. Our studies suggest that LDHC4 is a potential target for anticancer drug discovery and (ethylamino) (oxo)acetic acid provides a good start to develop lead compounds for selective drugs targeting LDHC4.(C) 2022 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB Vehicle intelligent classification plays a vital role in the Intelligent Transport Systems. However, due to the dynamic traffic environments, it is difficult to ensure the classification accuracy. Therefore, this article uses a new pulse coherent radar (PCR) to collect road vehicle data, and a vehicle classification method of sparrow search algorithm extreme learning machine (SSA-ELM) based on big multimodal data analysis is proposed. First, the road vehicle data are collected by PCR, where the vehicle length, chassis outline, and height features are extracted as the sample data. Then, the ELM is utilized to learn these three modal features. According to the input feature data, the vehicle type is classified, including cars, sport-utility vehicles, and buses. Finally, the SSA is applied to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of ELM. Experimental results show that SSA-ELM has notable advantages in classification accuracy and convergence speed, compared with existing benchmark methods.

AB It is reported that Notch3 and mTOR signaling pathways are involved in autophagy, and both can be activated by high glucose (HG). However, the relationship between Notch3 and mTOR and how Notch3 affects mTOR to regulate HG-induced autophagy in bovine kidney epithelial cells is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to explore how Notch3 affects mTOR to modulate HG-induced autophagy in bovine kidney cells. Our results showed that HG treatment significantly decreased the cell viability of MDBK cells in a dose-dependent manner. HG treatment significantly increased the expression of LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin1 protein and significantly decreased the expression of p62 protein. Consistently, LC3 fluorescence signal formation was detected by immunofluorescence in both dose and time-dependent manners. In addition, HG treatment significantly increased the expression of Notch3 protein and decreased the expression of the p-mTOR protein in both dose and time-dependent manners. Inhibition of Notch3 upregulated the expression of p-mTOR and p62 protein, and downregulated the expression of LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin1 protein. Besides, the function of Notch3 was investigated. In this study, inhibition of Notch3 activity significantly increased the viability of HG-stimulated MDBK cells. In summary, our results revealed that the Notch3-mediated mTOR signaling pathway was involved in HG-induced autophagy in MDBK cells.

AB The alpha,gamma-disubstituted butenolides are widespread occurrences in numerous pharmacologically active molecules. In this paper, a highly efficient method for the synthesis of alpha,gamma-disubstituted butenolide derivatives via a direct alpha-addition cascade isomerization of deconjugated butenolides with alpha-ketoesters using Et3N as catalyst, has been successfully developed. A series of alpha,gamma-disubstituted butenolides have been obtained in up to 97% yield with excellent regioselectivities (up to > 19/1 rr). To the best of our knowledge, there is no precedent for the application of deconjugated butenolides in the direct alpha-addition cascade isomerization to prepare alpha,gamma-disubstituted butenolides to date.

AB A triple Michael/aldol cascade reaction has been established to construct tetracyclic chromanes in a diastereoselective fashion (>= 5 : 1 dr). The polycyclic products were generated in 50-78% isolated yields under mild and metal-free conditions. Five reactive sites of enolate-tethered divinyl ketones were sequentially utilized to form four C-C bonds in a one-pot operation, leading to a construction of three new rings. Up to six consecutive stereocenters, including two quarternary stereogenic centers, were created in this domino process.

AB Aim of the Study. We set out to investigate the quality status of CR in China objectively according to the Chinese Pharmacopeia (ChP). We also explored the correlation between its growth area, morphological characteristics, and quality by analyzing physical and chemical indexes from 47 batches of CR collected from 12 provinces belonging to six geographic divisions. Materials and Methods. The macroscopic characteristics of CR as well as its moisture, ethanol extract, essential oil, total ash, and acid-insoluble ash contents were examined and calculated. In addition, qualitative identification and quantitative determination of alpha-cyperone, cyperotundone, and nootkatone were simultaneously performed, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint chromatogram was established. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gas chromatography methods recorded in ChP were used to measure the contents of residues of heavy metal and deleterious elements as well as residues of organochlorine pesticide, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis and typical canonical correlation analysis were performed using Origin 9.1 and SPSS 23.0 to explore the correlation between CR's growth area, morphological characteristics, and quality. Results. Of the 47 batches of CR analyzed, only 4 collected from the province of Shandong had a flat appearance, which did not accord with the macroscopic characteristics of CR. Overall, only 4 batches met ChP standards for CR. In addition, 30 and 38 batches did not meet the requirements for moisture content and essential oil content, respectively. The similarity values of HPLC fingerprints ranged from 0.568 to 0.986. Results of hierarchical cluster analysis for ethanol extracts, essential oil, alpha-cyperone, cyperotundone, and nootkatone and the HPLC fingerprints (total peak time and peak area) suggested that the samples could be classified into four clusters, with no significant difference in growth geographic areas among them. Results of canonical correlation analysis indicated that the first canonical pair could represent the correlation between macroscopic characteristics (vector 1) and chemical quality (vector 2), with shorter diameter and length denoting lower ethanol extract content and higher nootkatone content in a single grain of CR. Conclusions. Crude medicinal materials were collected and examined in this study to reflect the overall quality status of CR in China. The methods chosen to detect, calculate, and analyze the quality of CR were suitable to the investigation, and the results are crucial not only for estimating the current quality status of CR, but also for conducting further research into its cultivation, quality assurance, and commodity specification. Besides, this mode of investigation could be used to evaluate other medicines.

AB Dispersal plays a vital role in the geographical distribution, population genetic structure, quantity dynamics, and evolution of a species. Sex-biased dispersal is common among vertebrates and many studies have documented a tendency toward male-biased dispersal in mammals and female-biased dispersal in birds. However, dispersal patterns in reptiles remain poorly understood. In this study, we explored the genetic diversity and dispersal patterns of the widely distributed Asian pitviper Protobothrops mucrosquamatus. In total, 16 polymorphic microsatellite loci were screened in 150 snakes (48 males, 44 females, 58 samples without sex information) covering most of their distribution. Microsatellite analysis revealed high genetic diversity in P. mucrosquamatus. Bayesian clustering of population assignment identified two major clusters for all populations, somewhat inconsistent with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny of P. mucrosquamatus reported in previous research. Analyses based on 92 sex-determined and 37 samples of P. mucrosquamatus from three small sites in Sichuan, China (Mingshan, Yibin, and Zizhong) consistently suggested female-biased dispersal in P. mucrosquamatus, which is the first example of this pattern in snakes. The female-biased dispersal patterns in P. mucrosquamatus may be explained by local resource competition.

AB Developing electric-driven seismic vibrator is a promising way to realize green exploration. To ensure the service life of the power supporting frame under long-term operation, a method of predicting fatigue life under random load is proposed. First, stress history of the maximum stress node is obtained through dynamic analysis. Second, based on the rainflow counting method, the stress history at the maximum stress node was statistically analyzed, the distribution of amplitude and the distribution of mean are studied, and the load spectrum is compiled. Third, considering structural parameters and the stress below the fatigue limit, the P-S-N curve of the power supporting frame is achieved through two-steps corrections, and combined with the Miner's rule, the fatigue life of the power supporting frame is predicted. The results show that under the condition of the significance level of 0.05, the amplitude and the mean of the stress are independent of each other. The amplitude of stress obeys the Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 1.0362 and a scale parameter of 10.5108, and the mean of stress obeys a normal distribution with a mean value of 40.253 and a standard deviation of 10.1803. Under 95% reliability, considering the structural parameters and the stress below the fatigue limit, a more accurate P-S-N curve of the power supporting frame is obtained, and then with Miner's rule the fatigue life of the power supporting frame is predicted to be 8.5 years. Based on this study, the power supporting frame was successfully manufactured. This research also provides method and case reference for structural fatigue life prediction under random loads.

AB Yak are a unique free-grazing bovine species in high-altitude areas. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence and molecular characteristics of BNoV in yak. A total of 205 diarrheal samples of yak (aged <= 3 months) were collected from 10 farms in Sichuan Province, China, from May 2018 to October 2020, and four samples were detected as BNoV-positive with RT-PCR. Moreover, a nearly full-length genome of SMU-YAK-J1 containing three complete ORFs was successfully sequenced. Sequence analysis with only nine genome sequences of the GIII genogroup showed that SMU-YAK-J1 was most closely related with GIII.P2 GIII.4, sharing 90.9% gnomic nucleotide identity, but only shared 71.6-85.9% with other genotypes, which confirmed that SMU-YAK-J1 belongs to genotype GIII.P2 GIII.4. However, compared with the sole genome of GIII.4 in GenBank, the BNoV in this study also exhibited many unique amino acid changes among all the three ORFs, which may represent the unique genetic evolution of BNoV in yak. This study first determined the presence of BNoV in yak, contributing to a better understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of BNoV.

AB Shuining Temple in Bazhong is famous for its wide range of themes, diverse forms and exquisite carving. However, the wet environment, unstable cliff body and the semi-open preservation environment caused serious damage to the stone carvings of Shuining Temple, which affected the artistry of the stone carvings. Therefore, the protection and restoration work of the cliff statues of Shuining Temple is extremely urgent. In this paper, through the analysis of the pigments for the stone carvings in Shuining Temple, the information of the pigment is obtained, which, on the one hand, provides a scientific basis for the restoration of the pigments, and on the other hand, is conducive to the targeted protection of cultural relic workers, which is of great significance for the protection of cultural relics. This paper used superdepth three-dimensional video microanalysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrum analysis (XRF) , X-ray diffraction experiment analysis (XRD) and laser Raman spectrum analysis to comprehensively analyze the main composition minerals of shuining Temple moyan pigment from the appearance, structure and composition of the material. The results showed that the main mineral of sample No. 1 was yellow ochre, sample No. 2 was leaden, sample No. 3 was celadon, sample No. 4 was lead sulfate, sample No. 5 was lapis lazuli, sample No. 6 was goethite, and dihydrite was the white powder layer under the pigment layer. Due to the long-term exposure of the statues to the damp and semi-open environments, a few pigments could not be directly detected as standard substances, so secondary analysis should be conducted according to relevant data. For example, the main component of yellow ochre detected due to long-term weathering was Fe2O3. K2PbO2 and PbO2 were decomposed under the environmental conditions of moisture and microbial presence. Goethite is produced by a chemical reaction of hematite or pyrite. In addition, by comparing the synthetic time of artificial lapis lazuli with the excavation age of the statue, and by detecting the element Fe, which implies that pyrite is the main component of Venus in natural lapis lazuli, we can judge that the pigment of this sample is made of natural lapis lazuli, which enriches the use cases of natural lapis lazuli.

AB In this paper, we aim at proposing an efficient inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging method for multiple moving targets in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Firstly, the motion phase errors of the moving targets are estimated via the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) operation. After that, the hybrid ADMM (Hy-ADMM) which incorporates the regularization terms of l(1) norm and total-variation (TV) of the image magnitude is presented to recover the images. The Hy-ADMMreconstructionwould lead to a sub-image set corresponding to the number of moving objects, since the phase errors compensated echoes are separately obtained for different moving targets by the FrFT estimated phase factors. As a result, a maximum and minimum generalized likelihood ratio test (mm-GLRT) based composite imaging technique is utilized to obtain a whole imaging result from the compensated image sets. Compared with traditional imaging methods, the proposed scheme obtains better performance in terms of suppressing the noise and preserving the target features. Finally, numerical experiments are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB An atom-economical approach for the synthesis of arylquinones was achieved successfully via direct oxidative C-C dehydrogenative coupling reaction of quinones/hydroquinones with electron-rich arenes using an inexpensive Fe-I-2-(NH4)(2)S2O8 system. The efficiency of this catalytic approach was established with a broad scope of substrates involving quinones and hydroquinones to give high yields (60-89%) of several arylated quinones. The present protocol is simple, practical, and shows good functional group tolerance.

DE Broad learning system (BLS); group sparsity; nonconvex regularization;

ID VARIABLE SELECTION; REPRESENTATION
AB Broad Learning System (BLS) has been proven to be one of the most important techniques for classification and regression in machine learning and data mining. BLS directly collects all the features from feature and enhancement nodes as input of the output layer, which neglects vast amounts of redundant information. It usually leads to be inefficient and overfitting. To resolve this issue, we propose sparse regularization-based compact broad learning system (CBLS) framework, which can simultaneously remove redundant nodes and weights. To be more specific, we use group sparse regularization based on l(2,1) norm to promote the competition between different nodes and then remove redundant nodes, and a class of nonconvex sparsity regularization to promote the competition between different weights and then remove redundant weights. To optimize the resulting problem of the proposed CBLS, we exploit an efficient alternative optimization algorithm based on proximal gradient method together with computational complexity. Finally, extensive experiments on the classification task are conducted on public benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CBLS.

TI A Novel Metaheuristic Algorithm: The Team Competition and Cooperation

DE Optimization; metaheuristic; algorithm
AB Metaheuristic algorithm is a generalization of heuristic algorithm that can be applied to almost all optimization problems. For optimization problems, metaheuristic algorithm is one of the methods to find its optimal solution or approximate solution under limited conditions. Most of the existing metaheuristic algorithms are designed for serial systems. Meanwhile, existing algorithms still have a lot of room for improvement in convergence speed, robustness, and performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes an easily parallelizable metaheuristic optimization algorithm called team competition and cooperation optimization (TCCO) inspired by the process of human team cooperation and competition. The proposed algorithm attempts to mathematically model human team cooperation and competition to promote the optimization process and find an approximate solution as close as possible to the optimal solution under limited conditions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, this paper compares the solution accuracy and convergence speed of the TCCO algorithm with the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA). Experiment results of 30 test functions commonly used in the optimization field indicate that, compared with these current advanced metaheuristic algorithms, TCCO has strong competitiveness in both solution accuracy and convergence speed.

AB Miniaturization is the key for development of lightweight energy storage ceramics. Here, lead-free ceramics with the formula (1-x) (0.94Bi(0.5)Na(0.5)TiO(3)-0.06BaTiO(3))-xSr(0.7)La(0.2)TiO(3) (BNT-6BT-xSLT) were successfully sintered using traditional solid-phase synthesis. The phase structure, micro-morphology, ferroelectricity, and energy storage efficiency and density of BNT-6BT-xSLT were investigated in this work. We found that the introduction of SLT does not alter the multi-phase coexistence of the ceramics, but inhibits the growth of crystal grains. Further, doping with Sr2+ and La3+ destroys the ferroelectric long-range order and enhances the ionicity of A-site ions, and thus increases energy storage property. As a result, the BNT-6BT-0.08SLT ceramic maintains a high P (s) value of 40.77 mu C/cm(3) and exhibits excellent energy storage performance (W = 1.76 J/cm(3), eta = 60.1%).

AB The complete mitochondrial genome of the Leptobrachella alpina Fei, Ye, and Li 1990, was assembled for the first time. The mitogenome of this species was 17,763 bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNA), and a non-coding control region (D-loop). The base content of the mitogenome was that A, T, G, and C occupied 28.5%, 30.8%, 15.1%, and 25.6%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on 17 complete mitogenome sequences of the family Megophryidae by the Bayesian inference approach. The phylogenetic tree suggested that Leptobrachium and Oreolalax clustered into a clade and formed a sister group with Leptobrachella. This work is critical for the further genetic research and conservation of this species.

AB Where there is a team, there is envy emotion among team members. Prior studies argue that two opposite types of envy-benign envy and malicious envy differently influence team members' interactions, thus impact team creativity differently. However, little literature has discussed whether envy has a direct influence on team creativity. This research is conducted to narrow this literature gap. Moreover, if their relationship was verified, the mechanism needs to be further explored. Previous studies have shown negative public perception of envy and strong behavioral motivation function of it. Therefore, a morality-related variable-moral reflection, and a competition-related variable-knowledge seeking are introduced as mediating variables. To test the relationships among the above variables, an experiment with 74 MBA students' participation was conducted. The results show the positive relationship between benign envy and team creativity, while malicious envy gets the opposite result. Besides, knowledge seeking and moral reflection are proven to be bridges connecting envy and team creativity. Envy is more complicated than what previous studies have found. It has positive sides to team creativity.

AB Both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are important epigenetic modifications in neurodevelopment. However, there is little research examining the genome-wide patterns of 5mC and 5hmC in brain regions of animals under natural high-altitude conditions. We used oxidative reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (oxRRBS) to determine the 5mC and 5hmC sites in the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus of yak and cattle. We reported the first map of genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in the brain, brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus of yak (living at high altitudes) and cattle. Overall, we found striking differences in 5mC and 5hmC between the hypothalamus and other brain regions in both yak and cattle. Genome-wide profiling revealed that 5mC level decreased and 5hmC level increased in the hypothalamus than in other regions. Furthermore, we identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs), most of which overlapped with each other. Interestingly, transcriptome results for these brain regions also showed distinctive gene levels in the hypothalamus. Finally, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by DMRs and DhMRs may play important roles in neuromodulation and myelination. Overall, our results suggested that mediation of 5mC and 5hmC on epigenetic regulation may broadly impact the development of hypothalamus and its biological functions.

AB A Highly efficient route for the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted acetylene derivatives has been developed by nickel catalyzed cross-couplings of alkynyl halides with aryl titanium reagents under mild conditions. This has given corresponding cross-coupling products good to excellent isolated yields of up to 92 %. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in either alkynylhalides or aryltitanium substrates gave cross-coupling products good yields. This process was simple and easily performed, which provides an efficient method for the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted acetylenes derivatives. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The prevalence of pancreatic cancer is sharply increasing recently, which significantly increases the economic burden of the population. At present, the primary treatment of resectable pancreatic cancer is surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy with or without radiation. However, the recurrence rates remain high even after R0 resection. This treatment strategy does not distinguish undetected metastatic disease, and it is prone to postoperative complications. Neoadjuvant therapies, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is being increasingly utilized in borderline resectable as well as resectable pancreatic cancer.

AB Internationally cities are prone to the effects of urban stormwater issues caused by urban sprawl and climate change. Applying Water Sensitive Design (WSD) is an efficient way for cities to mitigate these issues. While WSD is becoming widely used worldwide, there are many unknowns regarding public support for employing WSD at industrial sites. In order to fill the gap, this study performed a socioeconomic-demographic valuation of Water Sensitive Industrial Development (IWSD) initiatives. These cover multiple dimensions of environmental and social issues caused by industrial development, including residents' concerns about environmental or social issues, awareness of IWSD, and willingness to pay (WTP) for different IWSD measures. We conducted a dedicated questionnaire survey with 651 residents living around 10 industrial sites in Auckland, New Zealand. In general, residents concern about environmental and social benefit degradation, which was mostly related to a 10-year residency length. Public WSD awareness was not strong, but residents supported IWSD and their education level, property ownership, and living experience positively affected their awareness of IWSD. In terms of residents' WTP for IWSD in Auckland, the annual amounts were NZD 59.68 million, and NZD 34.7 per person. Middle income, pre-middle age, and 10+ year residence groups were associated with higher WTP. Among different IWSD measures, rain garden, tree, and green roof gained higher WTP intentions. These findings can facilitate strategic planning, public acceptance, policy formulation, and investment directions for future IWSD implementation and also serve as a reference for other industrialised cities that are aiming to mitigate industrial impacts.

AB To solve the financing problem of the food producers, we consider a two-echelon contract food supply chain composed of a family farm with capital constraints and a food processing enterprise. With no capital constraints as the benchmark model, we analyze optimal decisions of the family farm and the food processing enterprise in the case of bank financing with bank participation only and bank financing with "government, bank, and insurance" coparticipation. Then, we discuss how the risk of yield uncertainty influences the optimal decisions and profits of the family farm and the food processing enterprise under different financing situation. Meanwhile, the reason why the government subsidizes agriculture is explored, and the policy of minimum purchase price of the food is initiated when the market price is too low. Finally, the numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented. The results show that the bank financing with "government, bank, and insurance" coparticipation improves the welfare of supply chain members more obviously than the bank financing with bank participation only; when the rice price is too low, the policy of minimum purchase price of food is initiated, which increases the revenue and the growing enthusiasm of the family farm; the profits of the family farm and the food processing enterprise will decrease as the risk of yield uncertainty increases in the case of bank financing, and the risk of yield uncertainty will be reduced for the family farm when bank financing with "government, bank, and insurance" coparticipation.

AB Two previously undescribed dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, named sieverlignans D-E (1-2), as well as eight known ones (3-10), were isolated from the aerial parts of Artemisia sieversiana. Their structures were elucidated from extensive spectroscopic analysis, including HRMS, NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) experiments. This study is the first to report dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans in the genus Artemisia and this plant. All the compounds were evaluated for their anti-neuroinflammatory activities on the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced nitric oxide production in BV-2 murine microglial cells. Compounds 1 and 6 exhibited the moderate activities with their IC50 values of 47.7 and 21.9 mu M, compared to a positive control quercetin with the IC50 value of 16.0 mu M. Graphic abstract

ID BIOSYNTHESIS
AB Antibiotic resistance and emerging viral pandemics have posed an urgent need for new anti-infective drugs. By screening our microbial extract library against the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the notorious ESKAPE pathogens, an active fraction was identified and purified, leading to an initial isolation of adipostatins A (1) and B (2). In order to diversify the chemical structures of adipostatins toward enhanced biological activities, a type III polyketide synthase was identified from the native producer, Streptomyces davawensis DSM101723, and was subsequently expressed in an E. coli host, resulting in the isolation of nine additional adipostatins 3-11, including two new analogs (9 and 11). The structures of 1-11 were established by HRMS, NMR, and chemical derivatization, including using a microgram-scale meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid epoxidation-MS/MS analysis to unambiguously determine the double bond position in the alkyl chain. The present study discovered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitory activity for the class of adipostatins for the first time. Several of the adipostatins isolated also exhibited antimicrobial activity against selected ESKAPE pathogens.

AB Psoroptes ovis var. cuniculi infestation rapidly causes skin lesion, cutaneous inflammatory and subsequent adap-tive immune response in rabbits. To success feeding and survive on the host skin, this mite should product bio-active molecules to confront host tissue repair and immune defense, but these molecules of this mite remains mostly unknown. Serpins have been proved to involve in diverse biological functions including parasite repro-duction, survival and modulating host defense. Limited information is currently available on serpins from Psoroptes mites. Herein, we identified four novel serpins (PsoSP3-PsoSP6) in P. ovis var. cuniculi using bioinfor-matics and molecular biology techniques. Sequence analysis revealed that PsoSP3-PsoSP6 comprised the com-mon features of typical serpins superfamily including serpin domains, signature or the reactive centre loop (RCL) domain. The recombinant PsoSP4-PsoSP6 (rPsoSP4-rPsoSP6) revealed variable potency inhibition on tryp-sin, chymotrypsin and elastase except for rPsoSP3 in inhibitory activity assays. By quantitative RT-PCR, the ex-pressions of PsoSP3 and PsoSP4 were higher in juvenile mites (larva and nymph) than in adult mites, however, PsoSP5 and PsoSP6 appeared near-exclusive expression in adult female mites. Immunolocalization showed that native PsoSP4 protein was localized in uterus, whilst native PsoSP3, PsoSP5 and PsoSP6 were specif-ically localized in the ovarian nutritive cell (ONC) in ovary. Our findings indicated that PsoSP3-PsoSP6 might play critical roles in development and reproduction physiologies. rPsoSP4-rPsoSP6 might participate in modulating host inflammation, immune response and tissue repair.

AB This study attempts to widen the conceptual space of resilience in (Western) psychology in order to better capture the resilience landscape of an ethnic minority group ravaged by the HIV/AIDS pandemic-the Nuosu-Yi in Southwest China. Without decolonizing the construct of resilience, non-Western versions of coping with adversities cannot be properly understood. Our process of decolonization of resilience involved two steps: First, we conducted semistructured interviews with the target population (N = 21) to take inventory of their Indigenous notions of resilience. Second, for conceptual comparison, we mapped the themes and categories, derived from thematic analysis, of the interview data onto the conceptual space of the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), which we used as proxy for mainstream conceptualizations of resilience. This mapping revealed multiple lacunae in the theoretical framework of RSA, and unique properties in the Indigenous approach to adversities in contrast. Far reaching theoretical and practical implications of this investigation are discussed.

TI Association of Zinc deficiency, oxidative stress and increased

   implication for the assisted reproductive technique
SO TRANSLATIONAL ANDROLOGY AND UROLOGY

DT Article
DE Globozoospermia; Zinc; oxidative stress; sperm DNA damage;
   intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
AB Background: Sperm DNA fragmentation and its adverse impact on outcomes of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in globozoospermic infertile patients has been previously reported. However, the association of Zinc element with DNA damage and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome in globozoospermic infertile patients remains unclear.
   Methods: Using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay, the levels of Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and SOD activities in seminal plasma from both globozoospermic infertile patients and fertile volunteers were tested respectively. Using sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test and Comet assay, the DNA damages in their semen samples from the two groups was detected. In addition, using Aniline Blue staining, their sperm nucleus maturations were also examined.
   Results: The levels of seminal Zinc and SOD activities were lower in the globozoospermic infertile patients and the double-stranded break DFI (DSB-DFI) were significantly higher than that in the fertile controls. Antioxidative insufficiency of SOD with a low Zn level might be responsible for oxidative stress, which may lead to DNA damage in globozoospermic spermatozoa. Zn deficiency might also have influence on the chromatin stabilization of globozoospermic spermatozoa during spermiogenesis, causing its more vulnerable to oxidative attack.
   Conclusions: Serious DSBs in globozoospermia and antioxidative insufficiency due to Zinc element deficiency in spermatozoa might be responsible for the failure of ICSI in globozoospermia.

AB A noise-enhanced quantum annealing algorithm is proposed for an efficient annealing process to obtain the optimal solution. Simultaneous multiple noises are introduced as the kinetic energy term into the Schrodinger equation, which effectively reduces the probability of the algorithm falling into a local optimum by the parallel annealing process. The experimental results on the numerical optimisation problem and a real-world plug-in hybrid electric vehicles charging problem show that the proposed scheme is very competitive.

AB Hens are raised apart from roosters in modern poultry production, a substantial change from their natural social structure. We compared productivity, injuries, behavior, physiology, microbiome and transcriptome of hens housed with (R+) or without (R-) roosters to quantify the effects of this change in social structure. Hens were raised free-range from 70 to 280 days when 30 birds per treatment were assigned to battery cages until Day 315 (R+C vs. R-C), while 30 birds per treatment remained in free-range pens (R+F vs. R-F). Response to a novel environment and object, behavioral time budgets, cecum microbiome, blood composition and transcriptomic sequencing of thigh muscle and spleen were analyzed. Hens housed without roosters showed better survival, consumed less food, produced more eggs and had better feed conversion. R+F hens clustered around the rooster and were less mobile in the novel environment and object tests. R+F hens displayed the richest microbiome, and the presence of roosters resulted in differentially expressed genes related to muscle development, cellular processes, environmental information processing and immune function. Removing roosters from housed hens intensified desirable characteristics favored by domestication probably operating by deprivation of mating behavior and reduced fear, along with altered microbial and genetic function.

DE AMH; Sertoli cell; Yak; Gene cloning; Spermatogenesis
AB Sertoli cells (SCs) are important testicular somatic cells that carry out various functions in spermatogenesis. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying SC development may facilitate the understanding of animal reproduction. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) is a dimeric glycoprotein produced by SCs and plays essential roles in spermatogenesis. In this study, we cloned the coding sequence of the yak AMH, predicated the structure of AMH protein, analyzed AMH expression in the testis at different stages, and studied the functions of AMH in yak SCs. The open reading frame (ORF) of the yak AMH contained 1728 bp and encoded 575 amino acids. Structural analysis revealed that the yak AMH protein had a highly conserved transforming growth factor-beta (TGE-beta) domain. The mRNA expression level for the AMH gene in yak testis increased significantly from the fetal stage to calf stage, then decreased with the increase of age. The highest expression was found in calf stage. Cell proliferation was depressed in AMH-deficient SCs. Expression of several genes involved in SC proliferation and development, including PCNA, BCL-2, BAX, CASP3, AR and AMHR2 were altered after knockdown of AMH. Also, three SC-secreted factors essential for spermatogenesis, SCF, GDNF and ABP, were repressed at the transcription level after AMH knockdown in yak SCs. Moreover, supplementation with exogenous AMH protein partially rescued SC proliferation, and the expression of PCNA, BCL-2, AR and AMHR2 after AMH gene interference. This research provided theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism by which AMH regulates yak spermatogenesis and might give new insights in improving yak reproductive performance in the future.

AB The effects of wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGH) and their ethanol elution fractions obtained on XAD-16 resin on physiological activity and fermentation performance of brewer's yeast during very-high-gravity (VHG) worts fermentation were investigated. The results showed that the addition of WGH and their elution fractions in VHG worts significantly enhanced yeast biomass and viability, and further increased the fermentability, ethanol yield and productivity of yeast. Supplementation with 40% ethanol fraction exhibited the highest biomass (6.9 g/L dry cell), cell viability, fermentability (82.05%), ethanol titer (12.19%, v/v) and ethanol productivity during VHG worts fermentation. In addition, 40% ethanol fraction supplementation also caused the most consumption of amino acid and the highest accumulation of intracellular glycerol and trehalose, 15.39% of increase in cell-membrane integrity, 39.61% of enhancement in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and 18.94% of reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in yeast under VHG conditions. Therefore, WGH supplementation was an efficient method to improve fermentation performance of brewer's yeast during VHG worts.

AB BackgroundLoss of the genomic stability jeopardize genome stability and promote malignancies. A fraction of ovarian cancer (OvCa) arises from pathological mutations of DNA repair genes that result in highly mutagenic genomes. However, it remains elusive why the ovarian epithelial cells are particularly susceptible to the malfunction of genome surveillance system.MethodsTo explore the genotoxic responses in the unique context of microenvironment for ovarian epithelium that is periodically exposed to high-level steroid hormones, we examined estrogen-induced DNA damage by immunofluorescence in OvCa cell lines, animal and human samples.ResultsWe found that OvCa cells are burdened with high levels of endogenous DNA damage that is not correlated with genomic replication. The elevation of damage burden is attributable to the excessive concentration of bioactive estrogen instead of its chemomimetic derivative (tamoxifen). Induction of DNA lesions by estrogen is dependent on the expression of hormone receptors, and occurs in G1 and non-G1 phases of cell cycle. Moreover, depletion of homologous recombination (HR) genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) exacerbated the genotoxicity of estrogen, highlighting the role of HR to counteract hormone-induced genome instability. Finally, the estrogen-induced DNA damage was reproduced in the epithelial compartments of both ovarian and fallopian tubes.ConclusionsTaken together, our study disclose that estrogen-induced genotoxicity and HR deficiency perturb the genome stability of ovarian and fallopian epithelial cells, representing microenvironmental and genetic risk factors, respectively.

AB Hyenas (family Hyaenidae) occupy a variety of different niches, of which the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) scavenges mainly on the carcasses of animals. We compared its genome with the genomes of nine other mammals, focusing on similarities and differences in chemoreception, detoxification, digestive, and immune systems. The results showed that the striped hyena's immune and digestive system-related gene families have significantly expanded, which was likely to be an adaptive response to its scavenging lifestyle. In addition, 88 and 26 positive selected genes (PSGs) were identified in the immune system and digestive system, respectively, which may be the molecular basis for immune defense system to effectively resist pathogen invasion. Functional enrichment analysis of PSGs revealed that most of them were involved in the immune regulation process. Among them, eight specific missense mutations were found in two PSGs (MHCclass II antigenDOAandMHCclass II antigenDOB), suggesting important reorganization of the immune system in the striped hyena. Moreover, we identified one cathelicidin gene and four defensin genes in the striped hyenas by genome mining, which have high-efficiency and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Of particular interest, a striped hyena-specific missense mutation was found in the cathelicidin gene. PolyPhen-2 classified the missense mutation as a harmful mutation, which may have aided in immune adaptation to carrion feeding. Our genomic analyses on the striped hyena provided insights into its success in the adaptation to the scavenging lifestyle.

AB This paper studies the reliableH(infinity)control on stochastic delayed Markovian jump systems (SDMJSs) with asynchronous jumped actuator failure and uncertain transition rates (TRs). It is assumed that the actuator failure occurs randomly under a Markov process with its jumping mode different from the system's one. A generalized functional Ito's formula for the closed-loop SDMJSs with mixed asynchronous Markovian jump modes (AMJMs) is successfully established. By the generalized functional Ito's formula and the mixed-mode-dependent Lyapunov functionals, a sufficient delay-dependent condition of the reliableH(infinity)controller design for the SDMJSs with mixed AMJMs is proposed via matrix manipulation and a relaxation method. Finally, an example on VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) helicopter system is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented controller design scheme.

AB The vertical and horizontal movement of water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) has a significant influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and water quality. However, how the amount, components and chemical qualities of WEOC change at horizontal and vertical levels, as well as desorption in the cascade model in subtropical red soils, are not fully understood. We sampled soils from four types of land (Elaeocarpus, Masson Pine, Crape-Myrtle and a deposition site) in a subtropical catchment as replicated cores (n= 96) and investigated changes in the molecular and structural constituents of WEOC using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy. Our results showed that WEOC concentration changed remarkably in all four plots, and that the concentration coupled with the relative abundance of aromatic compounds decreased with increasing soil depth, whereas low-molecular-weight materials increased with increasing soil depth. Five fluorescent components were identified by parallel factor analysis (i.e., tryptophan-like, tyrosine-like and three humic-substance-like components). The relative abundance of these components suggested that WEOC composition shifted along vertical soil layers. Dynamic variations in fluorescent indices indicated that WEOC from the subsoil has strong biological characteristics. Additionally, there was no significant correlation between WEOC and SOC in subsoil, indicating that much of the WEOC within mineral soils is of local microbial origin rather than from local soil organic matter. Sorption processes alone or stepwise exchange processes of WEOC on the soil minerals do not readily occur, as the red soil in a subtropical area is typically unsaturated and potentially has a large sorption capacity. Once soil carbon is adsorbed, it is difficult to release it into soil water by microbial processing. Data from the deposition site suggest that components of hydrophilic WEOC with low molecular weight are preferentially transported.

AB Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a diarrhea-causing pathogen. In this study, 92 diarrheic fecal samples from five farms in four provinces in China were collected and tested for BToV using a RT-PCR assay, and 21.73% samples were found to be BToV positive. Moreover, two complete BToV genome sequences (MN073058 and MN073059) were obtained from the clinical samples, which were 28,297 and 28,301 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that the two isolates shared 10 identical amino acid mutations in the S protein compared to the complete S sequences of BToV available in the GenBank database. In addition, seven consecutive amino acid mutations were found from aa 1,486 to 1,492 in the S protein of isolate MN073058. Moreover, the two isolates shared one identical amino acid mutation in the receptor binding sites of the HE protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the epidemic and genomic characterization of BToV in China, which is helpful for further understanding the genetic evolution of BToV.

AB Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into highly condensed chromatin and this repressive chromatin barrier can be overcome by altering the chromatin structure via histone modification enzymes. Here, we report Wdr70 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (spWdr70) plays important roles in multiple cellular processes including cell cycle progression, chromatin structure and DNA repair. Depletion of Wdr70 gene causes cell cycle delay, hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents and quick phenotypic changes. Moreover, we observed strong genetic interaction between Wdr70 and genes regulating checkpoint and homologous recombination (HR), pinpointing the function of Wdr70 to DNA end resection. Finally, we show that the function of Wdr70 could be attributed to monoubiquitination of histone H2B (uH2B) in the vicinity of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Taken together, our data reveal that Wdr70 and H2B monoubiquitination-dependent chromatin modulation is required for chromatin homeostasis and genetic stability.

ID TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; EMISSIONS; MODEL
AB Green growth has become an increasingly important paradigm for sustainable economic growth, resource development, and environmental protection. As the main focus in energy led green growth is a move away from fossil energy to clean energy, sustainable green growth resource development needs to measure both energy and environmental efficiencies. As the largest global energy consumer and carbon emitter, China has had to deal with serious energy and environmental issues in recent years, with its regional green growth performances being poorly assessed. Therefore, green growth clean energy-environmental efficiency assessments were examined in this paper, for which an integrated principal component analysis-data envelopment analysis based analysis approach was developed. It was found that while China's green growth has had a significant increasing trend in recent years, overall it was still at a low level, with the imbalances in China's regional economic development being reflected in its green growth. However, the excellent development and utilization of clean energy in most regions have significantly promoted a continuous improvement in China's green growth and the move toward sustainable resource development and utilization is contributing to long-term green growth. Green growth has also placed new demands on sustainable resource development in China. Therefore, underdeveloped regions that have sustainable resource endowments need to develop industrial systems that have clean energy as the main axis, and developed regions need to develop high-end industries that have low energy consumption and encourage mutual support systems between regions to ensure optimal sustainable resource, green growth development patterns.

Methods: Six-month-old female rats were randomly divided into seven groups: sham-operated; OVX; OVX with estradiol valerate; OVX with alendronate; and OVX with POE in graded doses (3.75, 5.0, or 7.5 g/kg/day). Administration began at week 6 after ovariectomy for 12 weeks. A comprehensive assessment of bone quality was performed, including serum biochemical markers, serum inflammatory factors, bone oxidative stress markers, bone mechanics, and bone histomorphometry. Results: POE treatment significantly decelerated OVX-induced body weight gain without affecting the uterus index and produced a significant decrease in the levels of serum bone turnover markers (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Biomechanical testing demonstrated that POE (5.0 and 7.5 g/kg/day) treatments significantly prevented the reduction in maximum stress and Young's modulus in OVX rats (p < 0.05). Compared with the OVX group, POE (3.75, 5.0, or 7.5 g/kg/day) treatments significantly increased trabecular bone mineral density by 35.03, 38.42, and 42.02%, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that POE has potential effects in regulation of bone metabolism and prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis.

AB A new strategy was developed for the construction of a multilayered chemical modified electrode. The electrode was modified with two layers of carbon nanotubes conglutinated by polydopamine embedded with beta-cyclodextrin. The practicability of the designed electrode was validated by the determination of catechol as a model molecule. Using the multilayered electrode, the redox peak currents in cyclic voltammetry for catechol were enhanced significantly compared with an electrode modified with single-layer carbon nanotubes. With the amount of added beta-cyclodextrin and pH optimized, the peak currents showed good linear relationship with concentrations of catechol in the range from 2.50 x 10(-7) to 4.00 x 10(-3 )mol center dot L-1 with a detection limit of 4.00 x 10(-8 )mol center dot L-1 based on a signal-to-noise ratio equal to three. The recovery values for spiked tap water and lake water were also satisfactory.

AB Tibetan sacred mountains, the unique landforms influenced by the Buddhist religion in many Himalayan regions, are suggested to have great potential for preserving animal diversity. Yet, a bias might lie in evaluating the effectiveness of such areas, given the local culture of respect for, and protection of, wildlife, resulting in many animals that are relatively tame and, thus, easier to be detected visually compared with other regions. Here, we provide the first assessment of this issue, using Galliformes as a representative taxon on a typical Tibetan sacred mountain in western China. We estimated diversity of Galliformes relying on direct sightings versus an indirect technique of counting feathers, which avoids detectability issues associated with habitat and tameness of species. The data from direct sightings showed a higher relative abundance on the sacred mountain compared with its surrounding matrix, whereas the indirect technique of counting feathers suggested no considerable gains in species richness and abundance on the sacred mountain. Given the bias, we suggest that the biodiversity effects of Tibetan sacred mountains should be revisited. For management practices, we suggest that care will be needed to link Tibetan sacred mountains with conservation efforts. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI CompRess: Composing overlay service resources for end-to-end network
   slices using semantic user intents
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
ID SPARQL
AB Network slicing is considered as a promising approach to bring flexible overlay services to end users, especially in the emerging 5G networks. Vertical network slices have been introducing new players into the arena of networked service provisioning such as automobile, healthcare, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) are the key enabling technologies for network slicing. The combination of SDN and NFV brings benefits such as network programmability, flexible resources composition, etc; nevertheless, it also introduces complexity in expressing resources composition logics. Following the Intent-Based Networking (IBN) ideology, this paper presents CompRess, an IBN practice and implementation of overlay service resources composition for end-to-end network slices based on Semantic Web techniques in SDN/NFV networks. Web Ontology Language and Resource Description Framework are used for resources modeling and description whereas SPARQL, a structural human-readable query language, is adopted for user intent expression to bring high-level abstraction and coarser-grained encapsulation of low-level operations. Meanwhile, back-end K Shortest Paths-based algorithms are derived to compose a multichain Virtual Network Function Forwarding Graph (VNF-FG) in an IBN flavor where several service function chains can be orchestrated for traffic steering under the hood of front-end SPARQL-expressed user intents. The simulation results demonstrate CompRess' applicability in multichain VNF-FG composition for end-to-end network slices.

AB The atomic structures, stabilities, electronic structures, and magnetic moments of neutral and singly positively and negatively charged SnnAl (n = 1-10) clusters are calculated with B3LYP/SDD method in density functional theory. Detailed analyses are implemented to acquire the properties of SnnAl(0, +/- 1) clusters, such as relative stabilities, electronic properties, natural population analyses, and magnetic moments. The calculation results show that the ground-state structures of Sn2Al, Sn7Al, and Sn8Al clusters are different from those of Sn-3, Sn-8, and Sn-9 clusters, the variation trend of binding energies of Snn + 1 and SnnAl(0, +/- 1) coincides, and the small kinks are the same. It is found that the changing tendency of the vertical electron detachment energies (VDEs) of Snn + 1 and SnnAl(0, +/- 1) is almost consistent with that of the adiabatic electron affinities (AEAs), except Sn8Al. Furthermore, the adiabatic ionization potential energies (AIPs) of SnnAl and Snn + 1 clusters exhibit oscillatory behavior, but the variation trend of SnnAl is contrary to that of Snn + 1 from n = 1 to n = 7. The simulation results indicate that SnnAl- and SnnAl+ display a similarity in the magnetic moments, when n = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. The charges are transferred from Al to Sn in Sn1-4Al.

AB Fenton-like reaction is efficiently catalyzed by Fe3O4 nanoparticles for water treatment, but the performance of Fe3O4-H2O2 system for bacteria inactivation has not been explored. Herein, we prepared Fe3O4/SiO2/C nanocomposites (FSCNC) as catalyst for the Fenton-like disinfection of Escherichia coli in water. FSCNC catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to oxidize the E. coli cells. FSCNC-H2O2 system was applicable in a wide and near neutral pH range of 4.5-8.5 for bacteria disinfection. The inactivation efficiency was regulated by the inoculation number, FSCNC amount and initial H2O2 concentration. The presence of FSCNC on E. coli surface was identified by energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometers under both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The inactivation mechanism was attributed to hydroxyl radical generation that oxidized the bacteria. Our results suggested that Fe3O4 nanomaterials could be a new material platform for bacteria inactivation in water treatment.

AB Most animals generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) are heteroplasmic; inheriting mitochondrial genetics from both donor cells and recipient oocytes. However, the mitochondrial genome and functional mitochondrial gene expression in SCNT animals are rarely studied. Here, we report the production of SCNT pigs to study introduction, segregation, persistence and heritability of mitochondrial DNA transfer during the SCNT process. Porcine embryonic fibroblast cells from male and female Xiang pigs were transferred into enucleated oocytes from Yorkshire or Landrace pigs. Ear biopsies and blood samples from SCNT-derived pigs were analyzed to characterize the mitochondrial genome haplotypes and the degree of mtDNA heteroplasmy. Presence of nuclear donor mtDNA was less than 5% or undetectable in ear biopsies and blood samples in the majority of SCNT-derived pigs. Yet, nuclear donor mtDNA abundance in 14 tissues in F0 boars was as high as 95%. Additionally, mtDNA haplotypes influenced mitochondrial respiration capacity in F0 fibroblast cells. Our results indicate that the haplotypes of recipient oocyte mtDNA can influence mitochondrial function. This leads us to hypothesize that subtle developmental influences from SCNT-derived heteroplasmy can be targeted when using donor and recipient mitochondrial populations from breeds of swine with limited evolutionary divergence.

AB In this study, the L1-gain control issues on positive system are investigated. A hybrid proportional impulsive with integral (PII) control scheme is proposed. This impulse-time-dependent control algorithm uses the proportional control action $K_p$Kp at impulse instants for stabilising, and applies the integral control strategy $K_{_I}$KI between impulse time intervals for improving the state convergence, respectively. The average impulsive interval approach and co-positive Lyapunov function method are employed to derive the sufficient conditions. Then L1-gain performance of the impulsive positive system can be guaranteed by solving the linear programming problem. In addition, iterative convex optimisation algorithm is presented for the design of PII control gain matrices. Numerical examples illustrate the expected results of this design.

ID CONFLICT; VIOLENCE
AB Triangulation is an important subject in marriage and family therapy. Chinese family culture emphasizes consanguinity, which means that adult children have great difficulty separating from their original families and establishing clear boundaries. This results in the unique problem of family-of-origin triangulation in Chinese marriages. The current study explored the relationship between family-of-origin triangulation and the marital quality of Chinese couples, and examined the mediating role of in-law relationships. A total of 341 Chinese couples, ranging from newlyweds to those with school-aged children, participated in the survey. The results demonstrate that family-of-origin triangulation of both husbands and wives negatively predicted wives' marital quality, whereas husbands' marital quality was only predicted by their own family-of-origin triangulation. Moreover, family-of-origin triangulation not only predicted marital quality directly, but also indirectly by damaging the relationships with in-laws. The actor effects of family-of-origin triangulation were partially mediated by in-law relationships, whereas the partner effects of husbands' triangulation on wives' marital quality was fully mediated by in-law relationships. Family therapists in China should pay more attention to intergenerational relationships and reestablishing the sub-system boundaries of husband and wife, and at the same time, focus on repairing the couple's relationships with the in-laws.

AB Due to the ever-increasing wireless service requirements, the issues of a limited frequency resource and underutilized frequency allocation scheme as well as frequency crowd have come to become increasingly severe. It gives rise to being difficult to effectively eliminate the spectrum interference and fulfill an efficient spectrum access mechanism using the congested frequency band. For this purpose, this paper conceives a simultaneous transmission and sensing scheme based on the guided independent component analysis combined with the cumulant-based non-Gaussian criterion for fulfilling full-duplex cognitive radio (FD-CR). The philosophy of this proposed scheme is that the ICA based blind source separation principle is firstly utilized for blind separation of the observation mixtures, and then the separated signals are recognized through correlation processing and non-Gaussian criterion based on cumulant. In particular, the known secondary user signal is used as a signature signal for assisting ICA framework construction for blind extraction of signals. As a key component of machine learning, the ICA theory can contribute significantly to conquering the static sensing problem and residual self-interference influence in existing conventional cognitive radio systems. The simulation experiments and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method and system design. In addition, the low complexity and performance enhancement of the proposed method are also validated by comparing with that of the two practical FD-CR schemes.

AB The study of group patterns in ungulates is very important, since grouping is a basic element of social organization. However, the behavior of Marco Polo sheep has been rarely reported because this argali subspecies lives in high-elevated, hard-to-reach areas. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the group size and group composition of Marco Polo sheep in the Pamir plateau. We found that though small groups (1-10 individuals) were the most numerous, the greatest number of argali formed mid-sized groups of 6-20 individuals, which was significantly larger compared to group sizes in other argali subspecies. This preference in Marco Polo sheep is likely related to their specific habitat, which is located on high-elevated plateaus with the least rugged and most open terrain, where staying in larger groups is the most effective strategy for survival. Regarding group composition, female groups were the most often registered, followed by male groups and mixed-sex groups. Mixed-sex groups were found more often during rutting season, slightly less often in winter and very rarely in other seasons, when most adult males and females were segregated into single-sex groups. Mixed-sex groups generally had the largest number of animals, which changed insignificantly over seasons, while female groups and male groups varied significantly and were closely correlated to the yearly breeding cycle and the availability and quality of their food supply. Marco Polo sheep formed larger groups as an effective antipredator strategy in seasons when forage amounts allowed them to doso, though human activities also had a significant impact on group patterns, forcing out wild sheep to aggregate on remnants of suitable pastures.

AB This paper addresses the problem of stability analysis for uncertain switched neural networks with mixed time-varying delays resorting to a novel delay division method. Firstly, based on the theory of arithmetic and geometric sequence, a hybrid division method is proposed to partition the delay interval into multiple subintervals with equal or unequal lengths. Secondly, a newly modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) including triple and quadruple integrals is established by considering the information of every subinterval. Thirdly, to deal with the derivative of LKF, the Wirtinger-based integral inequality and Peng-park's integral inequality are introduced. Finally, less conservative LMIs-based stability criteria are presented. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB In this paper, quasi-strict feasibility of a generalized mixed variational inequality as a new notation is introduced, which is weaker than its strict feasibility and recovers the existing concept of strict feasibility for a generalized variational inequality. By using the equivalent characterization of the nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution set for the generalized mixed variational inequality, it is proved that quasi-strict feasibility is a sufficient condition for the generalized mixed variational inequality with a f-pseudomonotone and upper hemicontinuous mapping to have a nonempty and bounded solution set in reflexive Banach spaces. Our results generalize and extend some known results in Zhong and Huang (J Optim Theory Appl 152(3):696-709, 2012).

AB Measuring software trustworthiness is an important field in trusted software assessment. In this paper, a dynamic model of multi-attributes dynamic software reliability assessment is proposed based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and gray correlation, since current software assessing methods cannot fully meet the accuracy and objectivity of the assessment. Our novel model of software trustworthiness comprehensive evaluation index system is established, where AHP comprehensive evaluation method is introduced to determine the trustworthy indicators and the weight of the sub-attributes. Meanwhile, group expert judgments are used to modify group decision results and the Euclid distance is used to judge the value's change of state checkpoints. In addition, the software properties probabilistic transformation model of each level of sub-properties is constructed to accomplish dynamic software reliability assessment using the methods of Markov chain process and gray correlation model. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of our dynamic software reliability assessment.

AB Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics of (Ba0.98Ca0.02)(Ti0.94Sn0.06-x Zr (x) )O-3 (BCTS0.06-x Z (x) ) were synthesized by the conventional solid-state method. The evolution of their microstructure, phase structure, and electrical properties of BCTS0.06-x Z (x) ceramics in the composition range of 0 <= x <= 0.06 was systematically investigated. A dense microstructure is developed, and a coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is identified in the ceramics, showing an enhanced electrical properties (e.g., d(33) similar to 545 pC/N, k(p) similar to 0.52, epsilon(r) similar to 3135, tan delta similar to 0.008, strain similar to 0.106%, and d(33)* similar to 503 pm/V) as well as relatively high Curie temperature (T-C similar to 100 degrees C) in the composition of x = 0.02. As a result, the addition of Zr content can effectively enhance the piezoelectricity of BaTiO3-based ceramics without sacrificing the T-C sharply, which is a promising candidate for lead-free piezoelectric ceramics.

AB Among currently reported anodic nano-alloy electrocatlysts for direct alkaline ethanol fuel cells (DAEFCs), the mass fraction (w) of co-catalysts is generally larger than 20%. This could increase the thickness of the catalyst layer in Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), which not only decreases the discharge voltage of fuel cells, also reduces the utilization of the noble metals such as Pt and Pd. To solve this problem, here we synthesized a series of Pd-Ni-P alloy electrocatalysts with ultra-low doping amount of Ni and P, using ca. 1.5 mg NaH2PO2 as reducing agent. To obtain different doping amount of Ni and P, the pH value of the synthetic solution was adjusted from 8 to 12 by 0.1 mol/L NaOH. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) results showed that the mass fraction of Ni and P were low to 0.2% and 0.05%, respectively, when the pH value of the synthetic solution is 10. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images showed that nanoparticles were distributed evenly on the carbon base, and their mean particle sizes increased from ca. 3.78 nm to ca. 5.4 nm with alkalinity of synthetic solutions increasing. Cyclic Voltammograms in 0.5 mol/L CH3CH2OH+1 mol/L NaOH solution revealed that the catalyst obtained under the pH 10 synthetic solution (hereafter denoted as Pd-Ni-P/C-pH10) gave a highest apparent current density of ca. 2466 mA.mg(-1) Pd, nearly 2.7 times in respect of that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst (JM). Meanwhile, the durability of Pd-Ni-P/C-pH10 for ethanol oxidation was improved by ca. 2.8 times compared to commercial catalyst. Relative to pure Pd, the binding energy of Pd 3d(5/2) of as-prepared catalysts all positively shifted, suggesting an obvious electronic interaction between Pd, Ni and P component in as-prepared catalysts. This interaction could led to a shift of the d-band center of Pd component, which may play a pivotal and dominated role in improving the catalytic performance for the ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline media.

AB It has already been suggested by researchers that there should be multiple intermediate states in the activation process for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the intermediate states are very short-lived and hardly captured by the experiments, leading to very limited understanding of their structural features and drug efficacies. In this work, a novel joint strategy of targeted molecular dynamics simulation, conventional molecular dynamics simulation, and virtual screening is developed to address the problems. The results from 10 intermediate conformations obtained from the work reveal that the ligand pocket is very unstable and fluctuates between the inactive state and the active one in the case of ligand-free, in particular for ECL2 as a gate-keeper of the ligand-binding. The ligand-binding site could be stable in the active state with a small volume and a completely closed ECL2, only when the G-protein-binding region is fully activated. In addition, the activations of the ligand-binding pocket and G-protein-binding site are relatively independent and exhibit a loose allosteric coupling, which contributes to the existence of multiple intermediate conformations. Interestingly, the screening performance of the agonists does not increase on increasing the overall activity of the intermediate state, but is dependent on the activated extent of the ligand pocket. The receptor is prone to bind the agonist when closing ECL2 and reducing the ligand-binding pocket volume, whereas it is more favorable for binding the antagonist when opening ECL2 and increasing the pocket volume. These observations added to previous studies could help us better understand the activation mechanism of GPCRs and provide valuable information for drug design.

AB Heat dissipation plays an important role in improving luminous efficiency and reliability for light emitting diode (LED) devices. In this paper, graphene/epoxy composite is synthesized and used as thermal interface material for LED heat dissipation enhancement. Experiment is conducted to test the interface resistances of the novel composite materials with different graphene mixing ratios. Moreover, the thermal performances and junction temperatures of LED device with and without such thermal interface materials are analyzed and compared to show the heat dissipation effect of the proposed composite thermal interface material. The results show that thermal conductivity of graphene/ epoxy composite increases with growing graphene mixing ratio and the interface resistance can be decreased by more than 70 % with the composite TIM. The case study indicates that junction temperature decreases from 72 degrees C to 67 degrees C for a 10 W power LED after using TIM, and such temperature difference becomes larger for higher LED power. Furthermore, with graphene/epoxy composite thermal interface material, temperature is distributed more uniformly in the heat sink, also benefitting LED heat dissipation. This work is important for practical heat sink design and optimization for LED equipment.

TI A judgment study of word-length preferences in Chinese NN compounds

DE Word-length preferences; Noun-noun compounds; Homograph ambiguity;
   Frequency; Acceptability experiment
AB Some seemingly robust linguistic generalizations remain controversial for years, often for lack of experimental verification. As a case study, we examine word length preferences in Chinese NN compounds. Since the original observation of Lu (1963), there has been a broad consensus that 1+2 (monosyllabic + disyllabic) is ill formed, while 2+1, 2+2 and 1+1 are well-formed. In addition, it has been shown that the preferences can be derived from metrical principles. However, a judgment experiment is yet to be offered to verify the preferences, and without it some scholars remain skeptical. We offer such an experimental study, in which 15 native speakers are asked to rate the acceptability of 1,132 randomly generated NN compounds, with 283 each of the four length patterns. It is found that 2+2 is the most acceptable, followed by 2+1, while 1+2 and 1+1 are the least acceptable. The high rating of 2+2 and the low rating of 1+2 support previous predictions. The rating for 2+1 is slightly lower than expected, and that of 1+1 is most unexpected. It is also found that four other factors (the naturalness of the referent, homograph ambiguity, the boundness of a morpheme, and frequency) have significant effects on acceptability judgment, although their sizes are smaller than that of the length effect.

AB In this study, a series of Zn(II)-dipicolylamine (Zn-DPA) based cationic lipids bearing different hydrophobic tails (long chains, alpha-tocopherol, cholesterol or diosgenin) were synthesized. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these lipids was studied in detail by investigating the effects of several structural aspects including the type of hydrophobic tails, the chain length and saturation degree. In addition, several assays were used to study their interactions with plasmid DNA, and results reveal that these lipids could condense DNA into nanosized particles with appropriate size and zeta-potentials. MTT-based cell viability assays showed that lipoplexes 5 had low cytotoxicity. The in vitro gene transfection studies showed the hydrophobic tails clearly affected the TE, and hexadecanol-containing lipid 5b gives the best TE, which was 2.2 times higher than bPEI 25k in the presence of 10% serum. The results not only demonstrate that these lipids might be promising non-viral gene vectors, but also afford us clues for further optimization of lipidic gene delivery materials.

AB The effect of phosphorus-containing ligands on the structure, energetics and properties of the (CdSe)(n) clusters (n = 3, 6, and 10) with different number of PH3 and PMe3 ligands were studied by using density functional theory calculations. The P atom in the ligand interacts with Cd and forms a strong Cd-P coordination bond. The introduction of ligands does not change the cluster architecture, but leads to considerable changes in Cd-Se bondlength, charge distribution, binding energy, HOMO-LUMO gap and optical absorption. The ligand influence is enhanced with increasing ligand coverage. A blueshift in absorption band was predicted for the clusters with increasing ligands, resulting from the electron donating characteristics of the ligands that hamper electron transition from Se to Cd. As P-containing ligands are often used in the preparation of CdSe nanocrystals, our calculations reveal the influence of ligand-cluster interaction on the cluster geometrical and electronic properties, which would be helpful for the nanocrystal design and synthesis.

AB This study examines the problem of robust stability analysis of neutral-type time-varying uncertain Lurie nonlinear control system with mixed time delays. Firstly, by discretizing the time-delay interval into non-uniformly multiple subintervals and decomposing the corresponding integral intervals to estimate the bounds of integral terms more exactly, less conservative stability criteria are derived. Secondly, based on the above delay-partitioning method, a newly augmented Lyapunov-Krasovkii functional is constructed. Thirdly, by taking full advantage of Wirtinger's integral inequality, which can provide tighter upper bound than Jensen's inequality, novel delay-dependent robust stability conditions are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results. (C) 2017 All rights reserved.

AB Utilizing zinc acetate as precursor, and monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA) as stabilizers, respectively, ZnO nanoparticles with uniformly distributed grains were synthesized by sol-gel method at different sintering temperatures. Analysis of the degradation of methyl orange by photocatalysis shows that utilizing MEA as the stabilizer and 550 degrees C as the sintering temperature results in smaller grain size, greater surface-to-volume ratio, and a density of surface defects suitable for a photocatalyst. The greatest photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange was achieved under UV irradiation. Based on our microstructural analysis and photocatalysis, the microstructure of ZnO particles and, in turn, their photocatalytic effect are affected significantly by the stabilizer type and the sintering temperature.

AB The current study was designed to explore the specific relationship between neurologic soft signs (NSSs) and characteristics of antisocial personality traits in adolescents, and to investigate particular NSSs linked to certain brain regions in adolescents with antisocial personality traits. The research was conducted on 96 adolescents diagnosed with ASP traits (ASP trait group) using the ASPD subscale of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire for the DSM-IV (PDQ-4+) and 96 adolescents without traits of any personality disorder (control group). NSSs were assessed using the soft sign subscales of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory. Adolescents with ASP traits showed more motor coordination, sensory integration, disinhibition, and total NSSs than the control group. Seven NSSs, including stereognosia in right hand, finger agnosia and graphesthesia in both hands, left-right orientation, and go/no go stimulus, were significantly more frequent in teenagers with ASP traits. Sensory integration was positively associated with ASP traits. Adolescents with antisocial personality traits might have abnormalities in the central nervous system, and sensory integration might be the particular indicator of antisocial personality disorder.

DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL-RESEARCH; SOMATIZATION; PERSPECTIVES; ALEXITHYMIA;
   DEPRESSION; VALIDITY
AB Objective
   This article adopts the perspective of psychosomatic medicine to present and test a theoretical model of the classification of clinical somatic symptoms. The theoretical model consists of four dimensions: emotional somatic symptoms, biological somatic symptoms, imaginative somatic symptoms, and cognitive somatic symptoms.
   Method
   A clinical somatic symptom classification scale was developed according to the theoretical model. A total of 542 participants completed the clinical somatic symptoms classification scale. The data were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.
   Results
   The results confirmed the theoretical model. The analyses found that the proposed theoretical structure of the scale was good, as indicated by factor loadings and fit indices, and that the scale had good reliability and construct validity.
   Conclusions
   Based on the interpretation of the clinical symptoms of psychosomatic medicine, the treatment of chronic non-infectious diseases includes at least three dimensions: the first is the etiological treatment, the second is the pathophysiological and pathopsychological dimension, and the third is symptomatic treatment. The unified psychosomatic point of view and diverse clinical thinking modes are aimed at identifying different classes of somatic symptoms and important prerequisites for the treatment of these symptoms. We registered the study with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and it was approved by the West China Hospital, Sichuan University ethics committee. Trial registration: The registration number is ChiCTR-OCS-14004632 (time: 2014-05-12).

AB In this paper, a novel delay partitioning method is proposed by introducing the theory of geometric progression for the stability analysis of T-S fuzzy systems with interval time-varying delays and non-linear perturbations. Based on the common ratio a, the delay interval is unequally separated into multiple subintervals. A newly modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established which includes triple-integral terms and augmented factors with respect to the length of every related proportional subintervals. In addition, a recently developed free-matrix-based integral inequality is employed to avoid the overabundance of the enlargement when dealing with the derivative of the LKF. This innovative development can dramatically enhance the efficiency of obtaining the maximum upper bound of the time delay. Finally, much less conservative stability criteria are presented. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvements of this proposed approach. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fully relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method is employed to calculate the excitation energies and wavelengths for nine isoelectronic sequences of tungsten ions. In calculations, electron correlations, quantum electrodynamical (QED) effect, and Breit correction are taken into account. The core-valence and valence-valence corrections are analyzed in a systematic way. The core setting was systematically studied for four cases of one electron occupying the outermost s orbital, one electron occupying the outermost p orbital, three electrons occupying the outermost p orbital, and one electron occupying the outermost d orbital. In our research, at least two calculation models are adopted for every tungsten ion. Through analyzing our results, it is found that the following three calculation models can help to get results closer to measured values: (i) setting the closed shells as core; (ii) taking core-valence corrections into account when there is only one valence electron; (iii) taking valence-valence corrections into account when the number of valence electrons is not less than three. The purpose of this paper is to provide some references on configuration selection and configuration interaction in calculations for a multi-electron system of highly charged tungsten ions.

AB Zuota is regarded as the king of Tibetan medicine. However, the major starting material of Zuota is mercury, which is one very toxic heavy metal. This has aroused serious doubts on the biosafety of Zuota containing drugs. In this study, we quantified the Hg contents in four Zuota samples, monitored the release of Hg in simulated gastric/intestinal juice and evaluated their cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells. Our results showed that the Hg contents in Zuota samples were in the range of 566-676 mg/g. Fortunately, the release of Hg from Zuota samples was very low in simulated gastric juice, and much lower in simulated intestinal juice. Direct contact of Zuota with Caco-2 cells led to dose-dependent cytotoxicity, including activity loss and membrane leakage. The toxicity was closely related to apoptosis, because the caspase 3/7 levels of Caco-2 cells increased after the exposure to Zuota. Interestingly, Zuota samples inhibited the oxidative stress at low concentrations, but the toxicity could be relived by antioxidants. The possible toxicity should be attributed to the cellular uptake of Zuota particulates. Beyond the cytotoxicity, significant differences among Zuota samples from different institutions were observed, suggesting that the preparation process of Zuota had meaningful influence of its biosafety. The implications to the safety and clinical applications of Zuota are discussed.

AB The NOD-like receptor (NLR) family caspase recruitment domain-containing 5 (NLRC5) is one of the newly discovered and largest NLR family members. The NLRC5 has recently received extensive attention because of its important role in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. The NLRC5 in many vertebrates, such as humans, mice, cattle, and horses, has already been proven and studied. However, the NLRC5 gene characteristics of pigs remain unclear. Thus, we completely cloned the NLRC5 cDNA sequence of the pig using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends(RACE) technology. A characteristic and tissue expression analysis was also conducted on the pig sequence. The sequence analysis showed that the complete cDNA sequence of the NLRC5 of the pig is 6638 bp, and the open reading frame is 5538 by which encoded 1846 amino acids. The protein prediction analysis indicates that the overall performance of the NLRC5 protein of the pig is hydrophilic and possesses a typical nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain(NBD) and 20 leucine-rich repeats(LRRs). The homology analysis result indicates that the NLRC5 transcript in pigs is highly homologous to cattle, sheep, macaques, and humans, and accounts for around 80%. The genetic evolutionary tree analysis shows that the NLRC5 transcript in pigs has the closest evolutionary relationship with cattle and sheep. Further tissue expression analysis shows that immune organ systems (e.g., lymph node and spleen) and mucosa organs (e.g., intestinal lymph node, stomach, and lungs) possess high expressions with NLRC5 mRNA. The result of this study indicates that the NLRC5 transcript in pigs is relatively conservative among mammals and may play a vital role in immune reaction, which provides a basis for further studies on the NLRC5 function in the pig immune system and the role in comparative immunity.

ID GROWTH
AB Local CO2 laser processing has been proved to be an effective method for mitigating damage growth of 3 omega) fused silica optics. For nonideal repaired damage site, the laser intensification induced by bubbles may result in near-field damage when ultraviolet laser transmitting through. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method is employed to quantify the electric-field around aforementioned bubbles in the vicinity of rear subsurface. Result shows that the modulation is more remarkable between neighbors than other region. The intensification increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of its depth and gap, and it monotonously ascends with increasing its size. With increasing its number at the same plane, a larger modulation acquired. Comparing non-coplanar with coplanar 4 bubbles, the latter generate much greater modulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Structural analysis reveals that the change of bridging ligands from dppe to dppp lead to the formation of centrosymmetric cations [Ag-2(Phterpy)(2)(NO3)(2)(dppe)] and [Ag-4(Phterpy)(2) (NO3)(2)(dppp)(2)](2+), especially complex 2 containing two independent centrosymmetric tetramers with the central (obligate) Ag2O2 planes. Complexes 1 and 2 consist of the 1D infinite chains, with different variations in pi-stacking patterns. Crystal structure of 1 contains ID infinite chains constructed by pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions between Phterpy, while 2 is built by pi center dot center dot center dot pi interaction of phenylene rings from dppp. All these reveal that the change of phosphine ligands might be the key of construction of different types of polynuclear structures and 1D pi-stacking chain. Moreover, the solid-state emission spectra of complexes 1 and 2 display broad emission bands at 420-600 nm. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Milk lysozyme is the ubiquitous enzyme in milk of mammals. In this study, the cDNA sequence of a new chicken-type (c-type) milk lysozyme gene (YML), was cloned from yak mammary gland tissue. A 444 bp open reading frames, which encodes 148 amino acids (16.54 kDa) with a signal peptide of 18 amino acids, was sequenced. Further analysis indicated that the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences identities between yak and cow milk lysozyme were 89.04% and 80.41%, respectively. Recombinant yak milk lysozyme (rYML) was produced by Escherichia coli BL21 and Pichia pastoris X33. The highest lysozyme activity was detected for heterologous protein rYML5 (M = 1,864.24 U/mg, SD = 25.75) which was expressed in P. pastoris with expression vector pPICZ alpha A and it clearly inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Result of the YML gene expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that the YML gene was up-regulated to maximum at 30 day postpartum, that is, comparatively high YML can be found in initial milk production. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the amino acid sequence was similar to cow kidney lysozyme, which implied that the YML may have diverged from a different ancestor gene such as cow mammary glands. In our study, we suggest that YML be a new c-type lysozyme expressed in yak mammary glands that plays a role as host immunity.

AB In this paper, an orientational anchoring transition of the thermotropic nematic liquid crystal (LC) (4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)) driven by hydrogen-bond (HB) interaction at the LC-aqueous interface is presented. After a 5CB film is introduced onto an aqueous solution of phenols such as nitrophenol, the alignment of 5CB changes from planar to homeotropic, which is attributed to HB interaction between 5CB and phenols at the LC-aqueous interface. On the other hand, the interaction of p-nitrophenol or m-nitrophenol with bovine serum albumin (BSA) is imaged by the LC sensor. Overall, the results provide new insight into interfacial phenomena occurring at the LC-aqueous interface, and hold the potential for biological and chemical sensing techniques based on HB interaction.

AB The current study characterized the spatial selectivity of numerosity adaptation. In Experiment 1, adaptors were arranged vertically with 8 dots at the top of the visual field and 400 dots at the bottom, and participants' perceived magnitude in the left field decreased compared to that in the right, as revealed in the numerosity comparing task after adaptation. In contrast, the perceived magnitude in the right field decreased compared to that in the left with inversed adaptors (400 dots at top, 8 at bottom). In Experiment 2, adaptors were presented horizontally, and they showed no significant effect on numerosity perception, which was tested vertically. This study demonstrated that numerosity adaptation along the vertical orientation could affect numerosity perception along the horizontal orientation, and the latter was affected by the former according to a rule of associating "top" with "right" and "bottom" with "left." The spatial selectivity of numerosity adaptation showed distinguishing features that should function to abstract spatial relationships rather than create purely retinotopic mapping. We proposed that numerosity adaptation is based on spatial-numerical-associated codes. Vertical adaptors could activate both the vertical and horizontal Mental Number Lines (MNLs) and involve an interaction between these types of MNLs. According to behavioral data, horizontal adaptors showed no significant influence on perception along the vertical orientation, which might be due to the higher threshold required to activate the vertical MNL.

AB Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) play a pivotal role in regulating cellular hypoxic response. In this study, we cloned and characterized the genes encoding IGF-1 and IGFBP-1 to improve the current knowledge on their roles in highland Bos grunniens (Yak). We also compared their expression levels in the liver and kidney tissues between yaks and lowland cattle. We obtained full-length 465 bp IGF-1 and 792 bp IGFBP-1, encoding 154 amino acids (AA) IGF-1, and 263 AA IGFBP-1 protein, respectively using reverse transcriptase-polyerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology. Analysis of their corresponding amino acid sequences showed a high identity between B. grunniens and lowland mammals. Moreover, the two genes were proved to be widely distributed in the examined tissues through expression pattern analysis. Real-time PCR results revealed that IGF-1 expression was higher in the liver and kidney tissues in B. grunniens than in Bos taurus (p<0.05). The IGFBP-1 gene was expressed at a higher level in the liver (p<0.05) of B. taurus than B. grunniens, but it has a similar expression level in the kidneys of the two species. These results indicated that upregulated IGF-1 and downregulated IGFBP-1 are associated with hypoxia adaptive response in B. grunniens.

AB We isolated and characterized microsatellite loci for the red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) from a microsatellite-enriched database, which was obtained using high-throughput sequencing technology. We designed primer sets for 445 microsatellite loci and after initial screening, 34 loci were genotyped in 31 red-crowned cranes. The number of observed alleles ranged from 3 to 10. Observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.197 to 0.935 and 0.453 to 0.887, respectively; the mean polymorphic information content was 0.663. Loci Lia10943, Lia60455, Lia48514, Lia62171, Lia1059, and Lia5286 deviated from expectation of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; however, significant linkage disequilibrium was not observed among the 34 loci. Using these 34 markers, we successfully completed parental identification for 19 cranes. The probability of exclusion for 7 selected loci (Lia271333, Lia3745, Lia11091, Lia45761, Lia16468, Lia21909, and Lia22355) was > 0.9977 and analyses with more loci increased the combination efficiency. These 34 markers were also proven to be efficient for individual identification. We recommend that this marker system be used in the systematic control of pedigree management and future genetic variation studies of red-crowned cranes.

AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) refer to a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membrane structures originating from endosomes or plasma membranes. EVs can be used as excellent medication carriers due to their characteristic as natural carriers for bioactive substances. They can be employed for intercellular communication to transport bioactive lipids, proteins, RNAs, DNA, and peptide segments for releasing into the extracellular surroundings. This paper discusses the biological characteristics of EVs, current methodologies for their isolation and purification, with particular emphasis on emerging strategies for EVs surface engineering. The methods for surface modification can be categorized into two approaches: pre-isolation and post-isolation. Pre-isolation methods involve genetic manipulation or metabolic engineering of the source cells to alter the EVs surface, while post-isolation methods entail physical or chemical modifications after EVs have been isolated. Based on the modification methods mentioned above, we present how these modified EVs can be utilized to treat specific diseases, including brain disorders, tumors, and liver conditions.

AB Under the pressures of global climate change, the sustainable management of plant resources in alpine gorge regions faces severe challenges. P. aquilinum var. latiusculum is widely harvested and utilized by residents in the upper reaches of the Dadu River-Min River basin due to its high edible and medicinal value. This study employed ensemble models to simulate the potential distribution of P. aquilinum var. latiusculum in this region, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, the centroid migration of suitable habitats, and niche dynamics. A production dynamics model was also constructed to identify current and future potential cultivation areas by integrating ecological suitability and nutritional component synergies. The results show that current high-suitability areas and core cultivation zones of P. aquilinum var. latiusculum are predominantly distributed in patchy, fragmented patterns across the Wenchuan, Li, Mao, Luding, and Xiaojin Counties and Kangding City. Under climate change, the "mountain-top trap effect" drives a significant increase in high-suitability areas and core cultivation zones, while moderate-to-low-suitability areas and marginal cultivation zones decrease substantially. Meanwhile, suitable habitats and cultivation areas exhibit a northward migration trend toward higher latitudes. The most significant changes in suitable area and cultivation zone extent, as well as the most pronounced niche shifts, occur under high-emission climate scenarios. This research facilitates the development of suitability-based management strategies for P. aquilinum var. latiusculum in the study region and provides scientific references for the sustainable utilization of montane plant resources in the face of climate change.

AB The quantification of environmental drivers for soil heavy metals is crucial for pollution control, yet their relative importance and critical thresholds remain unquantified at the macroscale. Therefore, Shapley additive explanations based on a random forest model were used to analyze environmental drivers of soil cobalt, nickel and vanadium distributions along a 4000-km transect. These results revealed that climate was the dominant factor, followed by topography, anthropogenic activities, and soil geochemical properties. Specifically, mean annual precipitation predominantly shaped the distributions of total and residual contents of these metals through weathering-leaching equilibrium (threshold approximately 670 mm), while acting synergistically with mean annual temperature (exceeding 5 degrees C) to promote vanadium transformation from labile to residual states. Altitude enhanced organic bound nickel and vanadium accumulation via hydrothermal and organic matter regulation. Low thresholds for population density (97 people km-2) and electricity consumption (555017 kWh km-2) indicated minimal anthropogenic activities could elevate carbonate bound metals through cement-derived carbonate cycling. The attenuated latitudinal trends of heavy metals were primarily attributed to biphasic effects of environmental factors and their interactive compensation. Therefore, climate dominated but synergized with other environmental drivers to collectively shape soil cobalt, nickel and vanadium distribution patterns.

AB Under global climate change, sustainable management of plant resources in alpine canyon regions faces severe challenges. M. esculenta, highly valued for its edible and medicinal properties, is widely harvested for consumption by residents in the upper Dadu River-Minjiang River region. This study employs ensemble models to simulate the potential distribution of M. esculenta in this region, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, centroid migration of suitable habitats, and niche dynamics. Additionally, a production dynamics model integrating ecological suitability and nutritional components was developed to delineate current and future potential cultivation zones for M. esculenta. The results indicate that current high-suitability areas and core cultivation zones of M. esculenta are predominantly distributed in a patchy and fragmented pattern. The high-suitability habitats in the upper Dadu River-Minjiang River region have three distribution centers: the largest spans southern Danba County, southern Jinchuan County, and northeastern Kangding City, while the other two are located in northeastern Li County, southwestern Aba County, and northwestern Ma'erkang City, with sporadic distributions in Heishui County, Maoxian County, and Wenchuan County. First-level cultivation areas are primarily concentrated in Kangding City, Danba County, Ma'erkang City, Li County, and surrounding regions. Under climate change, low-suitability areas and third-level cultivation zones for M. esculenta in the region have increased significantly, while high- and medium-suitability areas, along with first- and second-level cultivation zones, have decreased notably. Concurrently, suitable habitats and cultivation zones exhibit a migration trend toward higher northern latitudes. The most pronounced changes in suitable areas and cultivation zones, as well as the largest niche migration, occur under the high-emission climate scenario. This study facilitates the formulation of suitability-based management strategies for M. esculenta in the upper Dadu River-Minjiang River region and provides a scientific reference for the sustainable utilization of mountain plant resources under climate change.

AB This study established a model system consisting of yak myofibrillar protein (MP) and the Fenton system to investigate the effects of different concentrations of Polygonatum Odoratum Polysaccharides (POP) (0.0 %, 0.2 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 %, 2.0 %) on the physicochemical properties and gel behavior of MP induced by hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). The results indicated that POP inhibited the oxidation-induced deterioration of protein structure, enhancing the integrity and stability of the MP spatial structure and restoring its gel properties. POP suppressed the center dot OH attack on MP's amino acid side chains, reducing oxidation-induced protein crosslinking and aggregation. Moreover, it was observed that the protective effect of POP on MP against oxidative damage was concentration-dependent, with the 2.0 % concentration exhibiting excellent antioxidant properties. Overall, these findings suggest that the addition of POP alleviated the oxidative damage caused by center dot OH oxidation on MP and promoted the formation of enhanced gel characteristics.

AB Selenate (Na2SeO4), selenite (Na2SeO3) and selenomethionine (Se-Met) treatments were performed to evaluate the impact of selenium (Se) enrichment on Se accumulation, selenoprotein distribution, and phenolic acid metabolism in barley. Selenium was primarily distributed in protein, and Se-Met treatment led to the highest Se-protein concentration (246.91 mg/kg DW). The accumulation of Se in protein components was in the following order: glutelin > albumin > globulin > gliadin. Across all treatments, gliadin exhibited the highest unit Se concentration. Na2SeO4 and Na2SeO3 treatments enhanced Se accumulation in lower molecular weight proteins (15-25 kDa), while Se-Met treatment promoted Se accumulation in medium molecular weight proteins (35-45 kDa). Moreover, Se treatment contributed to up-regulating the transcription of genes related to phenolic acid metabolism and enhancing enzyme activity. Se-Met treatment led to a significant increase in phenolic acid content, particularly free phenolic acids, which made it advantageous over Na2SeO4 and Na2SeO3 treatments.

AB The harsh conditions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau pose significant physiological challenges to local fauna, often resulting in gastrointestinal disorders. However, Tibetan pigs have exhibited remarkable adaptability to the high-altitude stress of the Tibetan Plateau, a phenomenon that remains not fully understood in terms of their gastrointestinal microbiota. This study collected 57 gastrointestinal tract samples from Tibetan pigs (n = 6) and plain black pigs (n = 6) with comparable genetic backgrounds. Samples from the stomach, jejunum, cecum, colon, and rectum, underwent comprehensive metagenomic analysis to elucidate the gut microbiota-related adaptive mechanisms in Tibetan pigs to the extreme high-altitude environment. A predominance of Pseudomonadota was observed within gut microbiome of Tibetan pigs. Significant differences in the microbial composition were also identified across the tested gastrointestinal segments, with 18 genera and 141 species exhibiting differential abundance. Genera such as Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera, Fusobacterium, and Mitsuokella were significantly more abundant in Tibetan pigs than in their lowland counterparts, suggesting specialized adaptations. Network analysis found greater complexity and modularity in the microbiota of Tibetan pigs compared to black pigs, indicating enhanced ecological stability and adaptability. Functional analysis revealed that the Tibetan pig microbiota was particularly enriched with bacterial species involved in metabolic pathways for propionate and butyrate, key short-chain fatty acids that support energy provision under low-oxygen conditions. The enzymatic profiles of Tibetan pigs, characterized by elevated levels of 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase, highlighted a robust fatty acid metabolism and enhanced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In contrast, the gut microbiome of plain black pigs showed a reliance on the succinate pathway, with a reduced butyrate metabolism and lower metabolic flexibility. Taken together, these results demonstrate the crucial role of the gastrointestinal microbiota in the adaptation of Tibetan pigs to high-altitude environments by optimizing carbohydrate metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production for efficient energy utilization. This study not only highlights the metabolic benefits conferred by the gut microbiota of Tibetan pigs in extreme environments, but also advances our understanding of the adaptive gastrointestinal mechanisms in plateau-dwelling animals.

AB Wetland degradation is an escalating global challenge with profound impacts on animal diversity, particularly during successional processes. Birds, as highly mobile and environmentally sensitive organisms, serve as effective indicators of ecological change. While previous studies have primarily focused on local community structures and species diversity during a specific season, there is a need to extend the research timeframe and explore broader spatial variations. Additionally, expanding from simple species diversity indices to more multidimensional diversity indices would provide a more comprehensive understanding of wetland health and resilience. To address these gaps, we investigated the effects of wetland degradation on bird diversity across taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional dimensions in the Zoige Wetland, a plateau meadow wetland biodiversity hotspot. Surveys were conducted during both breeding (summer) and overwintering (winter) seasons across 20 transects in 5 sampling areas, representing 4 degradation levels (pristine, low, medium, and high). Our study recorded a total of 106 bird species from 32 families and 14 orders, revealing distinct seasonal patterns in bird community composition and diversity. Biodiversity indices were significantly higher in pristine and low-degraded wetlands, particularly benefiting waterfowl (Anseriformes, Ciconiiformes) and wading birds (Charadriiformes) in winter, when these areas provided superior food resources and habitat conditions. In contrast, medium and highly degraded wetlands supported increased numbers of terrestrial birds (Passeriformes) and raptors (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes). Seasonal differences in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity indices highlighted the contrasting ecological roles of wetlands during breeding and overwintering periods. Furthermore, indicator species analysis revealed key species associated with specific degradation levels and seasons, providing valuable insights into wetland health. This study underscores the importance of spatiotemporal dynamics in understanding avian responses to wetland degradation. By linking seasonal patterns of bird diversity to habitat conditions, our findings contribute to conservation efforts and provide a framework for assessing wetland degradation and its ecological impacts.

AB BackgroundUnderstanding the allocation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) among various plant organs is crucial for gaining insights into plant nutrient uptake, utilization strategies, and overall growth and life history strategies. However, little is known about the nitrogen and phosphorus allocation strategies among the three major plant organs (e.g., leaves, stems, and roots), particularly in phylogenetically closely related species. To investigate N and P allocation strategies among different plant organs, we collected 912 individuals of 62 Artemisia species, encompassing three subgenera, from 81 sites across a broad environmental expanse in China.ResultsAverage N and P concentration and N: P ratios in major plant organs of Artemisia species have significant variations among the subgenera and ecosystems. Across all 62 species, the numerical values of the scaling exponents of N(alpha N), P(alpha P), and N: P(alpha N: P) between leaves and stems, and leaves and root were consistently more than 1, while the corresponding scaling exponents for stems versus roots were either close to or less than 1; however, the numerical values of the scaling exponents among the three plant organs differed at subgenera levels but were relatively consistent across different ecosystems. Climate and soil had little effect on the numerical values of the scaling exponents among plant organs of Artemisia species at different local sites.ConclusionOur results found that the allocation of N and P among plant organs in Artemisia species differs at the subgenera level, suggesting that it is necessary to consider different subgenus levels when exploring plant nutrient concentration and allocation. Conversely, a conservative nutrient allocation strategy prevails at the ecosystem level. Thus, a key insight from these results is that nutrient allocation strategies of closely related species are phylogenetically conserved and are comparatively insensitive to local environmental conditions.

AB Asparagus officinalis L. has long been used as a medicinal food since ancient times. Despite identifying the active compounds, the anti-inflammatory properties of these compounds remain underexplored. This study explored the anti-inflammatory activity of white asparagus polysaccharide (WAPS) against skin inflammation. WAPS, a pectin polysaccharide, was identified to coexist with alpha-glycosidic and beta-glycosidic linkages glucan and probably has triple-helix confirmation suggested by Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cellular experiments indicated that WAPS attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and enhanced macrophage viability. Skin inflammation was ameliorated with WAPS liposomal-loaded gel; the mechanism regulating NF-kappa B/MAPK signal pathways was further explored. Notably, the formulation augmented the bioavailability of WAPS, downregulated the expression of NF-kappa B p50 and MMP9, and amplified the inhibitory potential of WAPS against inflammation. This study suggests WAPS as a medicinal substance with antiinflammatory efficacy.

AB Cellulose, synthesized by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, is an essential component of plant cell walls; defects in cellulose synthesis compromise cell wall integrity. The maintenance of this integrity is vital for plant growth, development, and stress responses. Consequently, plants must continuously synthesize and remodel their cell walls, a process intricately linked to cellulose biosynthesis. Phosphorylation modifications at specific sites on cellulose synthase represent a critical regulatory mechanism governing the dynamics of CESA complexes. In this minireview, we summarize the phosphorylation sites responsive to environmental factors in CESAs and discuss how alterations in phosphorylation status influence plant adaptation to environmental conditions as well as the dynamics of CESA complexes. Additionally, we propose potential upstream kinases targeting CESAs along with their respective target sites. Our efforts aim to enhance understanding of CESA phosphorylation's role in facilitating plant adaptation to environmental challenges.

AB Nitrogen (N) is one of the three major elements required for plant growth and development. It is of great significance to study the effects of different nitrogen application levels on the growth and root exudates of Phlomoides rotata, and can provide a theoretical basis for its scientific application of fertilizer to increase production. In this study, Phlomoides rotata were grown under different nitrogen conditions for two months. Soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) values, bioaccumulation, root morphology, root exudate composition, nitrogen metabolism enzyme and antioxidant enzyme activity were evaluated. The results showed that compared with CK (no N fertilizer), N2 (CO(NH2)2 80 mg/kg) and N3 (CO(NH2)2 160 mg/kg) through significantly improved the activities of nitrogen metabolism enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutamine synthetase (GS), enhanced the nitrogen metabolism process, and increased the accumulation of plant soluble sugars (SS) and soluble protein (SP), thus improving Phlomoides rotata biomass yield. After 60 days of treatment, low nitrogen (N1, CO(NH2)2 40 mg/kg) increased root length, root volume, root surface area, average root diameter, significantly increased the diversity of organic acids in root exudates, and enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes to adapt the nitrogen deficiency environment. This study can provide new ideas for understanding the mechanism of nitrogen tolerance in Phlomoides rotata and developing scientific fertilization management strategies for plateau plants and medicinal plants.

AB Low-temperature preservation of yak semen during transportation and conservation is crucial to accelerate yak breeding. The effects of low-temperature cooling on yak semen quality, however, are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the dose-dependent effect of mitochondriatargeted antioxidant "MitoQ" on the motility, oxidative status, and mitochondrial function of yak semen during low-temperature preservation. Semen samples were collected from six adult healthy Maiwa yaks and preserved at 4 degrees C in semen extender containing 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nM MitoQ, respectively. Firstly, the motility, membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and abnormity index of yak spermatozoa were evaluated to determine the optimal MitoQ concentration. Next, the effect of MitoQ at the optimal concentration on spermatozoa antioxidant capacity, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and superoxide dismutase content (SOD) levels, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed. Up to 96 h of low-temperature storage, 200 nM MitoQ showed the most optimal effect on motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity (P < 0.05) but not on sperm morphology (P > 0.05). Also, 200 nM MitoQ markedly reduced yak spermatozoa ROS and MDA contents for up to 48 h of low-temperature storage (P < 0.05). Finally, 200 nM MitoQ significantly improved T-AOC, SOD, and mitochondrial membrane potential for up to 24, 48, and 72 h of low-temperature storage, respectively (P < 0.05). In summary, semen extender supplementation with 200 nM MitoQ is beneficial for low-temperature yak semen preservation via improving the oxidative status.

AB Piezoelectric materials (PEMs) can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Substantial works were performed to optimize PEMs and devices for smart sensing, human monitoring, and medical applications, however, their electromechanical behaviors under such scenarios with different applied frequencies remain unclear. Here, the frequency response behaviors of piezoelectric output current are revealed based on lead-free and lead-based PEMs toward advanced applications. The results show a linear relationship between output current and frequency under short-circuit condition, with the slope varying according to loading force (F) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). However, when a load resistance (RL) is applied, a nonlinear relationship is shown: the current increases with frequency, reaches a critical point, and subsequently levels off. The saturation current is influenced by F, RL, d33, and device capacitance (C), while the critical frequency is related to RL, C, and action distance. This fundamental behavior of PEMs aligns with Maxwell's displacement current deducing and is wellsupported by circuit simulations and physical modeling. The universality of these results is further confirmed through lead-based PEMs. Open-circuit voltage is unaffected by f, while load voltage exhibits the same nonlinear frequency response as load current. Applying these findings by combining machine learning, human posture monitoring and robot motion recognition were achieved. This work gives a deep understanding of intrinsic frequency response behaviors of electromechanical conversion in PEMs and guides the emerging piezoelectric sensing and monitoring applications.

AB This study aims to determine the effect of different high-pressure processing (HPP) conditions (100 MPa/300 MPa/500 MPa; 2 min/4 min/6 min) on copigmentation, specifically between chlorogenic acid (CA), epicatechin (Epi), gallic acid (GA), malvidin-3-O-galactoside (Mv-3-O-gal), and malvidin-3-O-arabinoside (Mv-3-O-ara), as well as the storage stability of the copigmentation solutions. The results showed that the influence of different HPP treatment conditions on copigmentation was not significant. HPP treatment did not significantly affect the lambda max, peak absorption, color parameters, and Mv-3-O-gal anthocyanin content when applied alone or in combination with CA and Epi. However, the color intensity and a* value of Mv-3-O-gal with GA decreased by 3.2% (p < 0.05). The absorption peak, color, and content of Mv-3-O-ara were not affected by HPP alone or during copigmentation with CA, Epi, and GA. In addition, CA had the best effect on the co-coloring of Mv-3-O-gal, while GA was more successful in affecting Mv-3-O-ara during the storage period. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aromatic ring of CA was closest to the A-C plane of Mv-3-O-gal (3.70 & Aring;), resulting in a closer pi-pi stacking distance and higher bond energy. The favorable impact of GA on Mv-3-O-ara was because the A-C plane aromatic ring of Mv-3-O-ara and the aromatic D ring of GA formed "sandwich" stacking. The results indicated that combining HPP with polyphenols improved color and could be used to process raw materials containing malvidin, such as blueberries.

AB Research has shown that the presence of a complete cell wall structure in the grain endosperm reduces the digestibility of grains (starch) in the human body. In this study, composite structures of diverse contents of arabinoxylan (AX) and (3- glucan (BG) in combination with wheat starch were constructed to simulate the grid structure formed by the combination of starch granules wrapped within cell walls in the starch endosperm. The gel properties following gelatinization and aging of the complexes were analyzed using rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray scanning, and infrared spectroscopy. Based on this, the differences in the in vitro digestion process of starch complexes were investigated, and the digestion mechanism was explored to offer a theoretical basis for the development of starch-based foods with a low glycemic index. The synergistic effect of AX and BG was found to promote the entanglement and aggregation of molecules, AX and BG inhibits the gelatinization of starch. AX/BG (10 % blend proportion) significantly inhibited starch digestion in the starch complexes, with the lowest hydrolysis rate (76.7 %), which may be because AX and BG wrap the starch particles effectively.

AB Rumen-protected methionine (RPM) such as coated methionine (CM) and 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid isopropyl ester (HMBi) was usually used in dairy cows, but how RPM affects meat goats remains unclear. In this study, thirty weaned male Jianzhou Da'er goats were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: fed basal diet or basal diet supplemented with 0.12% CM or 0.22% HMBi, with the aim of examining their impact on growth performance, serum biochemistry, rumen fermentation, rumen microbiota, and intestinal development in meat goats. The findings indicate that HMBi supplementation led to an increase in body weight, feed intake, and feed-to-gain ratio, whereas CM only resulted in an increase in feed intake (all p < 0.05). Both CM and HMBi resulted in an increase in serum total cholesterol (TC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albeit with a decrease in serum triglycerides (TG) and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB, all p < 0.05). Both CM and HMBi supplementation decreased the rumen butyric acid concentration (both p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing showed that HMBi supplementation significantly increased the total abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Both CM and HMBi supplements increased the abundance of Rikenella and Proteiniphilum but decreased the abundance of Eisenbergiella, Enterocloster, Massilioclostridium, Eubacterium, Angelakisella, Blastopirellula, Christensenella, and Pseudoruminococcus. CM supplementation specifically increased the abundance of Desulfobulbus, Sodaliphilus, and Coprococcus while decreasing the prevalence of Anaerocella, Mogibacterium, and Collinsella. The supplementation of HMBi significantly enhanced the abundance of Paraprevotella, Bacilliculturomica, Lachnoclostridium, Dysosmobacter, Barnesiella, and Paludibacter, while decreasing the abundance of Butyrivibrio and Pirellula. Moreover, the administration of both CM and HMBi supplementation resulted in an increase in the ammonia-producing and sulfate-reducing bacteria, whereas a decrease was observed in the ammonia-oxidating, health-associated, and disease-associated bacteria. Correlational analysis revealed that TG and BHB had a positive correlation with disease-associated and ammonia-oxidating bacteria, whereas they had a negative correlation with ammonia-producing bacteria. The serum BUN, ALP, and AST were positively correlated with ammonia-producing bacteria but were negatively correlated with ammonia-oxidating bacteria. Furthermore, both CM and HMBi supplementation improve the development of the small intestine, with HMBi having a better effect. In summary, this study indicates that both CM and HMBi supplementation improve lipid metabolism, nitrogen utilization, and intestinal development. The growth promotion effect of HMBi supplementation may be attributed to the increased abundance of volatile fatty acid-producing and nitrogen-utilizing bacteria and improved intestinal development.

AB PurposeTo investigate the characteristics of olaparib-associated adverse events (AEs) in cancer patients.MethodsDatabases were searched for phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving olaparib treatment up to March 2024. A systematic assessment was performed.ResultsTwenty-seven RCTs involving 9542 patients were included. This meta-analysis indicates that olaparib could significantly increase the risk of developing any all-grade (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; p = 0.001) and high-grade (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19-1.77; p = 0.0003) AEs in cancer patients. Olaparib could increase the risk of dose reduction (RR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.59-5.70; p = 0.0007) and treatment discontinuation (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.28-3.14; p = 0.002). Hematologic toxicities and gastrointestinal toxicities commonly occur in patients receiving olaparib. Anemia, nausea, and fatigue were the most frequent AEs, with olaparib increasing the risk of both all-grade and high-grade occurrences of these events. Patients with longer treatment durations tend to have a higher risk of anemia. Patients with urinary system tumors tend to have a higher risk of nausea, while those with breast cancer tend to have a higher risk of fatigue. Olaparib maintenance therapy may be associated with a higher risk of fatigue. Olaparib could increase other AEs such as diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, dysgeusia, dizziness, headache, back pain, urinary tract infection, dyspnea, and cough.ConclusionOlaparib-containing therapy could increase the occurrence of specific AEs in patients with cancer. Clinicians should be aware of these risks and conduct regular monitoring.

AB The fertilization effect of nitrogen (N) deposition on global productivity may be limited by water availability due to the coupling effect of N and water on ecosystem carbon cycling. However, it remains unclear whether this limitation is synchronized between above- and belowground productivity. Based on a long-term field manipulation experiment in an alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found that precipitation played differential roles in regulating above- and belowground productivity responses to N addition. In experimental years with higher precipitation, N addition increased belowground productivity more. The main underlying mechanism was that higher precipitation mitigated excessive accumulation of soil inorganic N under N addition and shifted background plant community composition towards more N-favored species, which increased plant biomass allocation belowground and consequently stimulated the return of belowground productivity from N addition. In contrast, while N addition increased aboveground productivity, its effect didn't change with precipitation. This was mainly due to the trade-off between positive and negative effects of precipitation on the N response of aboveground productivity. Specifically, the precipitation-induced changes in soil inorganic N accumulation and background plant species composition reduced the return of aboveground productivity from N addition, while precipitation also offset this effect by mitigating the N-induced plant species loss, resulting in an overall insignificant effect of precipitation on the N response of aboveground productivity. Our findings imply that the trends of belowground productivity under N deposition can't be inferred solely from the easily measured aboveground parts, especially in the context of climate change. The work underscores an urgent need for more belowground measurements to improve the assessment of terrestrial carbon sinks.

AB To achieve sustainable environmental development, various biodegradable films have been designed to replace plastic films. The cell walls of the wheat bran aleurone layers primarily comprise alternately overlapping arabinoxylan (AX), beta-glucan (BG) and small quantities of cellulose and ferulic acid. The differences in their composition can affect their mechanical strength and hydration. Therefore, multilayer films of AX, BG, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), and free ferulic acid were prepared to simulate the cell walls of wheat aleurone layers, and the effect of different CNF contents on cell walls characteristics was investigated. The microstructure, physical properties, and hydration characteristics of multilayer films were studied using scanning electron microscopy, time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance, and thermogravimetric analysis. The AX/BG/8%CNF multilayer films possessed excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties along with slow moisture diffusion and flowability. When the CNF content within the films was 8%, the polymer composite structure hindered the diffusion of moisture. Inspired by the biological effects of wheat grain cell walls, cellulose multilayer films were used for blueberries preservation, and the decay rate, weight loss index, and respiration rate of blueberries were found to decrease significantly.

AB To investigate the dynamic changes and potential correlations between microbial diversity and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during Chinese medium-temperature Daqu (MTD) manufacturing at different key stages, in this study, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) were employed to analyze the microbial diversity and VOCs of MTD, respectively. The results showed that Weissella, Staphylococcus, Thermoactinomyces, Kroppenstedtia, and Lactobacillus were the dominant bacterial genera, while Aspergillus, Alternaria, Thermoascus, Thermomyces, Wickerhamomyces, and Saccharomyces were the dominant fungal genera. A total of 61 VOCs were detected by GC-IMS, among which, 13 differential VOCs (VIP > 1) were identified, that could be used as potential biomarkers to judge the fermentation stage of MTD. Kroppenstedtia and Saccharopolyspora were positively correlated with 3-methyl-2-butenal and 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane-D, respectively, and both of these were positively correlated with butanal-D. Acetobacter, Streptomyces, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) including Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Weissella, and Lactobacillus were negatively correlated with their associated VOCs, while fungi were generally positively correlated with VOCs. Wickerhamomyces, Saccharomyces, and Candida were positively correlated with butan-2-one-M. This study provides a theoretical basis for explaining the mechanisms of MTD flavor formation and screening functional microorganisms to improve the quality of MTD.

AB We investigate the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the internationalization speed of Chinese multinational enterprises (CMNEs) through the lenses of a resource-constraint framework and a legitimacy perspective. By considering the tension between legitimacy and efficiency, and utilizing the 2206 firm-year data from 473 publicly listed CMNEs from 2011 to 2019, we illustrate the distinct effects between two types of CSR (e.g., internal CSR and external CSR) and internationalization speed. While external CSR focuses on commitments to external stakeholders, such as customers, communities, and the environment, internal CSR prioritizes internal practices and rules that fulfill the organization's duties to the employees. Specifically, the costs associated with engaging in internal CSR surpass the legitimacy gains, resulting in a negative impact on internationalization speed; conversely, the efficiency benefits of engaging in external CSR outweigh the legitimacy losses, thereby positively influencing internationalization speed. What is more, institutional distance, which captures the difference in institutional profiles between two countries, weakens the positive impact of external CSR on internationalization speed but intensifies the negative effect of internal CSR on internationalization speed. This research contributes to the international business literature by considering a balanced perspective on the trade-off between legitimacy and efficiency. Our study further enriches the CSR literature by shedding light on the distinct influences that diverse CSR initiatives exert within the context of internationalization.

AB Siberian wildrye (Elymus sibiricus) is a xero-mesophytic forage grass with high nutritional quality and stress tolerance. Among its numerous germplasm resources, some possess superior drought resistance. In this study, we firstly investigated the physiological differences between the leaves of drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) genotypes under different field water contents (FWC) in soil culture. The results showed that, under drought stress, DT maintained a lower leaf water potential for water absorption, sustained higher photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced oxidative damage in leaves by efficiently maintaining the ascorbic acid-glutathione (ASA-GSH) cycle to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to DS. Secondly, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we analyzed the gene expression profiles of DT and DS leaves under osmotic stress of hydroponics induced by PEG-6000. Through differential analysis, we identified 1226 candidate unigenes, from which we subsequently screened out 115/212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were more quickly induced/reduced in DT than in DS under osmotic stress. Among them, Unigene0005863 (EsSnRK2), Unigene0053902 (EsLRK10) and Unigene0031985 (EsCIPK5) may be involved in stomatal closure induced by abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Unigene0047636 (EsCER1) may positively regulates the synthesis of very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes in cuticular wax biosynthesis, influencing plant responses to abiotic stresses. Finally, the contents of wax and cutin were measured by GC-MS under osmotic stress of hydroponics induced by PEG-6000. Corresponding to RNA-seq, contents of wax monomers, especially alkanes and alcohols, showed significant induction by osmotic stress in DT but not in DS. It is suggested that limiting stomatal and cuticle transpiration under drought stress to maintain higher photosynthetic efficiency and water use efficiency (WUE) is one of the critical mechanisms that confer stronger drought resistance to DT. This study provides some insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in E. sibiricus. The identified genes may provide a foundation for the selection and breeding of drought-tolerant crops.

AB A new and highly sensitive voltammetric technique was described in this study for the concurrent detection of endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) based on carbon nanocages (CNCs) and copper oxide nanochains (CuONCs). The CNCs was prepared by the solvothermal method and characterized using various techniques. Utilizing the nanocomposite of CNCs and CuONCs, the voltammetric sensor demonstrated outstanding performance in detecting BPA and BPAF simultaneously with distinct oxidation peaks and increased current peaks. The voltammetric signals have linear relationships with the two bisphenols ranging from 0.500 mu M to 100 mu M with a detection limit of 0.16 mu M for BPA and 0.14 mu M for BPAF. The newly designed sensor showed reliable consistency, long-term durability and anti-interference ability, and performed well in analyzing real water samples, indicating great potential for environmental monitoring.

AB The increasing use of genome-scale data has significantly facilitated phylogenetic analyses, contributing to the dissection of the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that shape phylogenetic incongruences, such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization. Lilieae, a prominent member of the Liliaceae family, comprises four genera and approximately 260 species, representing 43% of all species within Liliaceae. They possess high ornamental, medicinal and edible values. Yet, no study has explored the validity of various genome-scale data in phylogenetic analyses within this tribe, nor have potential evolutionary mechanisms underlying its phylogenetic incongruences been investigated. Here, transcriptome, Angiosperms353, plastid and mitochondrial data, were collected from 50 to 93 samples of Lilieae, covering all four recognized genera. Multiple datasets were created and used for phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated and coalescent-based methods. Evolutionary rates of different datasets were calculated, and divergence times were estimated. Various approaches, including coalescence simulation, Quartet Sampling (QS), calculation of concordance factors (gCF and sCF), as well as MSCquartets and reticulate network inference, were carried out to infer the phylogenetic discordances and analyze their underlying mechanisms using a reduced 33-taxon dataset. Despite extensive phylogenetic discordances among gene trees, robust phylogenies were inferred from nuclear and plastid data compared to mitochondrial data, with lower synonymous substitution detected in mitochondrial genes than in nuclear and plastid genes. Significant ILS was detected across the phylogeny of Lilieae, with clear evidence of reticulate evolution identified. Divergence time estimation indicated that most of lineages in Lilieae diverged during a narrow time frame (ranging from 5.0 Ma to 10.0 Ma), consistent with the notion of rapid radiation evolution. Our results suggest that integrating transcriptomic and plastid data can serve as cost-effective and efficient tools for phylogenetic inference and evolutionary analysis within Lilieae, and Angiosperms353 data is also a favorable choice. Mitochondrial data are more suitable for phylogenetic analyses at higher taxonomic levels due to their stronger conservation and lower synonymous substitution rates. Significant phylogenetic incongruences detected in Lilieae were caused by both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulate evolution, with hybridization and "ghost introgression" likely prevalent in the evolution of Lilieae species. Our findings provide new insights into the phylogeny of Lilieae, enhancing our understanding of the evolution of species in this tribe.

AB Carbon dots (CQD) have received significant attention as a novel ratiometric fluorescent pH nanoprobe, owing to their favorable optical properties and excellent biocompatibility. Despite their appealing features, the precise mechanism behind the pH-sensitive photoluminescence of CQDs remains to be fully understood. This study endeavors to unravel the mechanism underlying the pH-responsive ratiometric fluorescence in dual-emission CQDs, synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method using o-phenylenediamine and oxalic acid as precursors. The resultant CQDs exhibit inherent dual-emission at wavelengths of 383 nm and 566 nm, with the ratiometric fluorescence response tailored by the ratio of precursors, providing a robust tool for pH sensing across a range of 2 to 6. Detailed characterizations, including chemical, morphological, and optical analyses, alongside theoretical insights from time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), elucidate the mechanism underlying the pH-dependent luminescence, attributed to the electron cloud transmission between amide and adjacent carboxyl groups on the CQD surface. The superior performance of these CQDs in real-time pH monitoring is demonstrated through their application in glucose oxidase-catalyzed reactions, showcasing their potential as efficient, reliable nanoprobes for biomedical research and diagnostic applications.

AB Invertebrates greatly support the growth, development, and reproduction of insectivorous birds. However, the influence of human activity (e.g., pesticide use, deforestation, and urbanization) inevitably leads to a decrease in global arthropods. The diversity and variation in invertebrate diet influence the food composition of birds, especially species living in rapidly changing environments, such as the Tibetan Plateau. However, little is known of the seasonal variation in invertebrate diet in response to environmental changes. Here, we characterized the invertebrate diet composition in pre- and post-breeding black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) using fecal metabarcoding. We identified 38 invertebrate genera; the top three were Tipula (82.1% of relative abundance), Ceramica (3.0%), and unclassified_Hymenoptera (2.5%), with Tipula predominated the diet in both seasons. We also observed 20 and 16 unique genera in the pre- and post-breeding periods, and the genera composition was distinct between seasons (R = .036, p = .024). In pre-breeding, black-necked cranes tended to consume more diverse foods, and individual cranes exhibited greater heterogeneity at the genus level. At the genera and species level, pre-breeding black-necked cranes showed a wider dietary niche than post-breeding cranes. We observed season-specific features, with Tipula (common crane fly) and Stethophyma (grasshoppers) being enriched in the post-breeding period and Ceramica (moth) being more abundant in the pre-breeding period. Three Tipula species had the greatest importance in discriminating between seasonal diets. This study demonstrated a seasonal pattern of invertebrate diet in the black-necked crane, suggesting diet composition in response to resource and species availability. These results elaborate on the foraging ecology of highland birds and can inform the management of black-necked crane conservation.

AB The fruit of Phyllanthus emblica (PE) is a 'drug homologous food' that is rich in polyphenols for treating inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, the ability of PE polyphenols (PEP) to alleviate ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to reveal the chemical composition of PEP and its therapeutic potential for treating UC. In this study, PEP was purified with an NKA-2 macroporous resin and identified via liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Furthermore, a dextran sulfate sodium salt-induced UC mice model was used to evaluate the ability of PEP to alleviate UC. The symptoms, histopathology, expression of inflammatory cytokines, mucus and tight junction levels, changes in the gut microbiome and colon transcriptomics of UC mice were assessed after PEP intervention. The results suggested that PEP strikingly improved weight loss, disease activity index scores, colon length changes and histopathological damage. Moreover, PEP inhibited the expression of serum proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1(1, and IL-6) and sustained intestinal integrity by increasing the expression of Mucin 2, Zonula occludens 1 and Occludin. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that PEP regulated disorders of the gut microflora related to inflammation and the mucus barrier, including Escherichia_Shigella, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, Helicobacter and Anaerostipes. Transcriptome sequencing analysis, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry confirmed that PEP regulated reversed genes as well as effector proteins enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway (PPAR gamma, MMP1, CYP4A12A, and UCP1) and the Wnt/(1-catenin signaling pathway (Wnt8B, FZD9, GSK3(1, p-GSK3(1, (1-catenin, Axin2 and Lgr5). These findings indicate that PEP has therapeutic potential for alleviating UC and could serve as a functional dietary supplement.

DE Colorectal cancer; ZNF334; Histone acetylation; dCas9-P300; Epigenetics
AB Although therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment have been developed, the treatment outcomes are not ideal and survival rates for CRC patients remain low. It is critical to identify a specific target and develop an effective CRC treatment system. The ZNF334 gene is a newly identified member of Zinc-finger proteins (ZNFs), which is essential for key biological processes associated with tumorigenesis. Abnormal epigenetic reprogramming of the ZNF334 gene promoter region decreases its expression in CRC and further induces the occurrence of CRC. Here, we clarified that P300 in CRC can regulate the H3K9/27 ac in the ZNF334 promoter. Furthermore, histone acetylation of the ZNF334 promoter region was increased by dCas9-P300 to normalize the deficiency of ZNF334 expression, thereby inhibiting the growth of CRC. Collectively, our findings enable a facile way to affect gene expression using CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome editing and further determine the causal link between histone acetylation and gene activation, providing a promising gene therapy strategy for the CRC treatment.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rheum palmatum (RP) is a widely used traditional herb, which possesses antioxidant properties, inhibits ROS production and reduces fever. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to examine the antioxidative properties of the water extract of RP on oxidative-stressed mice. Materials & methods: Forty mice were administered with DL-homocysteine (DL-Hcy) to induce oxidative stress and were divided into four groups: 1) CK: NaCl and water; 2) DL-Hcy: DL-Hcy and water; 3) DL-Hcy+50RP: DLHcy with 50 mg kg- 1 body weight (BW) d- 1 RP; and 4) DL-Hcy+150RP: DL-Hcy with 150 mg kg- 1 BW d- 1 RP. Rhein (0.3 mg g- 1 dry matter) was the main active ingredient in RP. Results: When compared with Dl-Hcy mice, the mice with supplementary RP mitigated oxidative stress by reducing the liver concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 27% and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) by 32%, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidney and spleen. These responses were more pronounced in DL-Hcy+150RP than DL-Hcy+50RP mice. RP also exhibited therapeutic effects on liver steatosis, chronic kidney nephritis and intestinal villus width shortening caused by oxidative stress, and concomitantly decreased the serum glucose concentration (RP vs. DL-HCY, 2.3 vs. 4.1 mmol L-- 1 ). Conclusion: It was concluded that RP possesses antioxidant and therapeutic properties that can mitigate lesions on organs and prevent diabetes in oxidative-stressed mice. This study highlights the potential of RP as a medicinal supplement for animals in the future.

ID INDIRECT RECIPROCITY; PROMOTES COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS
AB Research on reputation-based indirect reciprocity has found profound achievements, elucidating its role in promoting cooperation over selfish actions. However, some evaluation methodologies have limitations, such as the image scoring model, a classic first-order paradigm. Several studies have suggested that higher-order rules with more individual information can enhance the stability of cooperation. In this study, we introduce a reputation incentive mechanism to explore the cooperative differences among various evaluation rules. Specifically, players evaluate their opponents' actions following first-order and second-order evaluation rules, respectively. Given that players possess varying degrees of social influence, the evaluative intensity is influenced by the neighbor environment and updated in each round. This resultant fluctuations in reputation exhibit heterogeneity and dynamism. Numerical simulations based on the spatial prisoner's dilemma game demonstrate that under stringent conditions, the first-order rule can sustain cooperation, while the second-order rule may fail, leading to complete group defection. Under more relaxed conditions, the second-order rule proves more effective in promoting full cooperation than the first-order rule. Our research contributes to understanding the guidance and influence of reputation on collective behavior.

AB Digital technologies can bring about fundamental changes in corporate processes, which may result in a shift from process innovation to digital process innovation. However, owing to resource constraints and various stakeholders, digital process implementation is extremely challenging for firms. Based on stakeholder theory, this study explores whether and how stakeholder pressure for digitalization can facilitate corporate digital process innovation and unravels the mediating effect of routine reconfiguration and the moderating effect of strategic flexibility. The findings from a survey of 351 firms prove that stakeholder pressure for digitalization can facilitate corporate digital process innovation via routine reconfiguration. Moreover, this study finds that increased strategic flexibility can strengthen the positive mediating effect of routine reconfiguration. The findings contribute to the deep understanding of digital process innovation and offer a boundary condition for the effectiveness of stakeholder pressure.

AB Addressed in this article is the problem of observer-based periodic event-triggered (PET) adaptive fuzzy control for a class of nonlinear systems adopting a predictor approach. In most existing results on PET output-feedback control, only the system output at sampling instants is available for observer design. For the use of more effective information in observer, a predicted signal of the continuous system output is generated by a predictor and used for the construction of observer. Then, a dynamic gain is introduced to the construction of Lyapunov function to ensure the decreasing property of the developed Lyapunov function at sampling instants. Owing to this good property, the PET adaptive controller can be designed using adaptive fuzzy control and backstepping techniques. It is proved that the system states are locally bounded and converge to a small neighborhood of the origin under given sampling period and controller. Finally, two examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed control method.

ID CARBON NANOTUBES
AB We reported a series of nitrogen-doped carbon-supported palladium (Pd) species with various sizes for the Heck reaction of iodobenzene and methyl acrylate. By precisely controlling the synthesis procedure, we have successfully synthesized a range of Pd-based catalysts, including single Pd atom, sub-nanometer Pd clusters (- 0.4 nm, and -1.6 nm), and Pd nanoparticles (-5.8 nm and 10 nm). Remarkably, these catalysts exhibit a distinct size-dependent catalytic activity in the Heck reaction. In the case of the Heck reaction of 4-methoxy-iodobenzene and methyl acrylate, the Pd-10 site demonstrated the highest site-specific turnover frequency (TOF), reaching 792.5 h-1. This performance is impressively 5.2 and 15.6 times superior to that of the Pd1 site (152 h-1) and Pd10 site (50.6 h-1), respectively. Significantly better in the Heck reactions with other aryl halides were achieved with Pd-1.6/N-C (comprising of approximately 1.6 nm-sized Pd clusters), compared to those containing 10 nmsized nanoparticles (Pd-10/N-C) or Pd1/N-C. These findings suggested that Pd clusters of around 1.6 nm may serve as the potential catalytic sites for the Heck reaction.

AB Photonic soft materials, especially responsive photonic hydrogels (RPHs) with periodic permittivity on the submicroscale, have been garnering interest as colorimetric indicators and mechanochromic sensors. However, the fabrication of RPHs with both bright discoloration, satisfactory mechanical properties, and excellent mechanochromic sensitivity to meet the practical applications is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop a novel photonic crystal material using a Fe 3 O 4 array embedded poly( N -isopropylacrylamide- co -acrylamide)/ laponite-XLS (PNA-XLS) hydrogel, which is dual-cross-linked by chemical and physical cross -linkers. Due to the interaction of sparse chemical links and apposite physical links between the polymeric networks, the PNA-XLS exhibits a significant energy dissipation and high deformation capacity, with an enhanced tensile strength above 819 kPa and elongation above 1015 %. It almost has a full-color tunable range and shows bright discoloration that can be reversibly actuated by bending, stretching, and small pressures (Pa level), with extremely high sensitivities of pressure (161 nm kPa -1 ) and tension (1.52 nm % -1 ). Moreover, its self-adhesion (133 kPa) would make it be an appealing candidate to develop portable sensors or wearable devices without auxiliary adhesive tools. Besides, elastic hydrogels with programmable and multicolor patterns can be designed by the mask-assisted UV photopolymerization of regional pregel solution. Therefore, such hydrogel has a great application potential in colorimetric indicators, mechanochromic sensors, anti-counterfeiting and wearable devices.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Artemisia rupestris L. (AR) is a traditional medicinal herb commonly used in the Uyghurs and Kazakhs; it was first documented in the Supplement to Compendium of Materia Medica written by Zhao Xuemin in the Qing Dynasty of China and is used clinically to treat colds, hepatitis, and allergic diseases. Aim of the study: The material basis and mechanisms of AR in acute liver injury (ALI) remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to reveal the possible active components involved in liver protection in AR and to preliminarily explore their pharmacological mechanisms. Materials and methods: The chemical composition of the ethanolic extract (ARA) was identified by UPLC-QExactive-MS/MS and confirmed by 32 reference standards. The pharmacodynamic results were utilized to screen the active part within the ARA that contribute to the amelioration of CCl 4 /ConA-induced ALI. The main active components and core targets were predicted by network pharmacology and verified by molecular docking combined with qPCR and Western blotting. Results: A total of 131 chemical components were identified in the ARA. The extraction parts of ARA had different therapeutic effects on ALI, among which the dichloromethane extract (ARA-D), which might constitute the main effective fraction of ARA, had significant anti-ALI effects. The network pharmacology results showed that targets including PIK3R1, AKT1, and EGFR, as well as 7 compounds, such as artemetin, vitexicarpin and rupestonic acid may play pivotal roles in treating CCl 4 /ConA-induced ALI. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was the main pathway involved. In each model, ARA-D dose -dependently reduced the increase in ALT levels. High -dose ARA-D markedly decreased ALT activity from 196.79 +/- 24.82 to 66.37 +/- 16.19 U/L in the CCl 4 model group and from 178.00 +/- 28.39 to 50.67 +/- 7.39 U/L in the ConA model group. Further studies revealed that ARA-D significantly inhibited TNF- alpha, IL-1 beta , and IL -6 expression and inhibited the protein expression of PI3K, p-PI3K, and p-AKT in CCl 4 /ConA-induced ALI. Conclusion: ARA-D exhibits protective effects against ALI induced by CCl 4 /ConA, potentially through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings may help to determine the material basis and mechanisms of action of ARA-D for liver protection and provide ideas for future comprehensive studies.

AB Protein lysine lactylation, a recently discovered post-translational modification (PTM), is prevalent across tissues and cells of diverse species, serving as a regulator of glycolytic flux and biological metabolism. The yak (Bos grunniens), a species that has inhabited the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for millennia, has evolved intricate adaptive mechanisms to cope with the region's unique geographical and climatic conditions, exhibiting remarkable energy utilization and metabolic efficiency. Nonetheless, the specific landscape of lysine lactylation in yaks remains poorly understood. Herein, we present the first comprehensive lactylome profile of the yak, effectively identifying 421, 308, and 650 lactylated proteins in the heart, muscles, and liver, respectively. These lactylated proteins are involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolic process encompassing carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins during both anaerobic and aerobic glucose bio-oxidation, implying their crucial role in material and energy metabolism, as well as in maintaining homeostasis in yaks.

AB Chaotic or hyperchaotic systems have a significant role in engineering applications such as cryptography and secure communication, serving as primary signal generators. To ensure stronger complexity, memristors with sufficient nonlinearity are commonly incorporated into the system, suffering a limitation on the physical implementation. In this paper, we propose a new four-dimensional (4D) hyperchaotic system based on the linear memristor which is the most straightforward to implement physically. Through numerical studies, we initially demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits robust hyperchaotic behaviors under typical parameter conditions. Subsequently, we theoretically prove the existence of solid hyperchaos by combining the topological horseshoe theory with computer-assisted research. Finally, we present the realization of the proposed hyperchaotic system using an FPGA platform. This proposed system possesses two key properties. Firstly, this work suggests that the simplest memristor can also induce strong nonlinear behaviors, offering a new perspective for constructing memristive systems. Secondly, compared to existing systems, our system not only has the largest Kaplan-Yorke dimension, but also has clear advantages in areas related to engineering applications, such as the parameter range and signal bandwidth, indicating promising potential in engineering applications.

AB The synergy of adsorption and photocatalysis is a good method to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. In recent decades, persistent photocatalysis has gained considerable interest for its ability to sustain the catalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the dark. Herein, we report three different TiO2 nanomaterials to remove tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) in solution. We found that the removal ability of TiO2, Ni-TiO2, and Ag/Ni-TiO2 is 8.8 mg/g, 13.9 mg/g and 23.4 mg/g, respectively, when the initial concentration of TCH is 50 mg/L. Chemical adsorption could be the rate-determining step in the TCH adsorption process. Moreover, Ag nanoparticles dispersed on Ni doped TiO2 surface act as traps to capture photo-generated electrons upon illumination with indoor light. The holes in Ag/Ni-TiO2 serve as critical oxidative species in TCH degradation under dark conditions. This work provides new insights into the design of persistent photocatalysts that can be activated by weak illumination and degrade organic pollutants in wastewater after sunset.

AB Simple Summary: The yak (Bos grunniens) is a multi-tasking grazing ruminant species playing vital roles for Tibetan nomads living in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Yaks are subjected to undernutrition in traditional pasture management systems during long winters due to inadequate forage intakes. This results in animals losing 25.7 similar to 30.2% of their live weight. Large ruminant animals have high intakes of feed and water. The utilization of dietary nitrogen efficiency of yaks is only about 25.9%, and a large amount of nitrogen is excreted in their feces and urine. Changes in nutritional measurement could improve the utilization of dietary nutrients and regulate the synthesis of proteins in yaks. Methionine and lysine are the first two limiting amino acids in a corn-soybean-meal-based diet for ruminants; therefore, we added rumen-protected methionine and lysine to low- and high-protein diets and found that the low-protein diet supplemented with rumen-protected methionine and lysine is beneficial for rumen and body health, physiological response, and metabolic status in yaks.
   This study investigated the effects of the dietary protein level and rumen-protected methionine and lysine (RPML) on the growth performance, rumen fermentation, and serum indexes of yaks. Thirty-six male yaks were randomly assigned to a two by three factorial experiment with two protein levels, 15.05% and 16.51%, and three RPML levels: 0% RPML; 0.05% RPMet and 0.15% RPLys; and 0.1% RPMet and 0.3% RPLys. The trial lasted for sixty days. The results showed that the low-protein diet increased the DMI and feed conversion ratio of yaks. The diet supplemented with RPML increased the activities of IGF1 and INS and nutrient digestibility. The high-protein diet decreased the rumen butyrate concentration and increased the rumen isovalerate concentration. The low-protein diet supplemented with RPML increased the rumen pH and the concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, butyrate and NH3-N; the high-protein diet supplemented with a high level of RPML decreased the rumen pH and the concentrations of isobutyrate, isovalerate, propionate and NH3-N. The low-protein diet supplemented with RPML increased the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity, along with the concentrations of malondialdehyde and amino acids such as aspartic acid, lysine, cysteine, etc. In conclusion, a low-protein diet supplemented with RPML is beneficial for rumen and body health, physiological response, and metabolic status in yaks.

TI Insights into the roles of superficial lattice oxygen in formaldehyde

SO NANOSCALE
LA English
DT Article

AB K+-modified birnessite materials were constructed to remove formaldehyde (HCHO) in this work. The introduction of K+ led to weakening of the Mn-O bonds and enhanced the migration of superficial lattice oxygen, resulting in improved redox properties and catalytic activity. MnO2-3K with the largest specific surface area and greatest abundance of superficial lattice oxygen showed the best catalytic performance at 30-130 degrees C. The operando analyses reveal that HCHO is primarily activated to dioxymethylene (DOM) and subsequently converted to formate species (*COOH). The accumulation of formate species caused a decline in catalytic performance during extended testing at 30 degrees C, a challenge that could be mitigated by raising the temperature. Theoretical studies disclose that the *COOH -> *H2CO3 step with the largest energy barrier is the rate limiting step for HCHO deep decomposition. Molecular oxygen could be activated at oxygen vacancies to replenish the depleted lattice oxygen after decomposition of carbonate species (*H2CO3) and CO2 and H2O desorption. The adsorbed oxygen and water did not limit the deep oxidation of HCHO. This research presents a promising approach for designing highly efficient, non-noble metal catalysts for formaldehyde degradation.
   Superficial lattice oxygen serves as the predominant active center for catalyzing the oxidation of HCHO. The transformation from formate species into carbonate species is the rate limiting step, which could be accelerated by temperature increments.

AB A highly efficient and simple cross -coupling reactions of aryltitanium reagents with N -aryl thiosuccinimides for the synthesis of arylsulfide derivatives using Cu(acac)2 (20 mol%) as catalyst are reported. Under the optimum reaction conditions, the coupling reaction between (hetero)aryltitanium reagents with N -aryl thiosuccinimides can be carried out smoothly, 18-93 % isolated yields of arylsulfides were obtained. In addition, 1-(pyridin-2ylthio)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione and 1-(isobutylthio)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione worked efficiently with aryltitanium reagent as well. Furthermore, the broad substrates scope and the typical maintenance of vigorous efficiency on gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize arylsulfide derivatives. The method avoids the use of expensive transition metals, such as Pd, Ir or Rh, phosphine ligands, and has the advantages of simple operation and high reaction efficiency. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lanthanum and cerium are widely used as important raw materials for energy storage batteries due to excellent natural electrical, magnetic, and optical properties. However, with the explosive growth of new energy generation and the environmental degradation-resistant of lanthanum and cerium, it is difficult to balance environmental sustainability and resource scarcity to achieve lanthanum-cerium removal by conventional chelate salt precipitation. Herein, a laboratory-scale self-powered electro-membrane bioreactor (SPEMBR), integrating high-active nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-loaded iron and molybdenum bimetallic conductive composite electrode membrane (M-N-CNTs@Fe/Mo) by hydrothermal and phase inversion processes was successfully constructed and evaluated for removing lanthanum cerium from industrial wastewater. The prepared bi-functional M-N-CNTs@Fe/Mo5% electrode membrane exhibited a uniform morphology and excellent hydrophilicity, with nano pore lattice spacing only 0.2637 nm. Electrochemical test results demonstrated that the novel electrode indicated excellent redox properties (i(0) = 8.35 x 10(-3) A cm(-2), C-dl = 1.13 mF cm(-2)) and efficient electron transfer efficiency (R-ct = 4.69 Omega, n = 3.9). Based on optimized conditions (5)% doping ratio, pH = 10, C = 20 mg/L), the SPEMBR assisted by M-N-CNTs@Fe/Mo catalytic electrode membrane achieved approximately complete removal efficiency of lanthanum and cerium (>99.2 %), superior to most publicly available related studies (86.3 %-99.0 %), but with a calculation cost of only $8.54. Identification of membrane interface products and system precipitates demonstrated that the outstanding removal efficiency was attributed to the combined reaction mechanism of electroreduction, electrocoagulation and electromembrane filtration. This work provides a bright application prospect for low-cost and effective removal of lanthanum cerium metal based on electrode membranes.

AB Two CuO nanostructures, namely, nanospheres (CuONSs) and nanochains (CuONCs) with different shapes but similar diameters, were synthesized and characterized. With these two nanomaterials as electrode modifiers, a systematic comparative study was conducted to examine their electrochemical sensing of catechol (CT) using a dual-working electrode system. The results suggest that for CuONS- and CuONC-modified glassy carbon electrodes, the electrode process for the CT redox is diffusion-controlled, and the modification amount and electrolyte pH have a similar effect on the response. However, the CuONCs showed a higher peak current and lower peak potential, as well as a lower detection limit for the electrochemical oxidation of CT. This is explained by the lower charge transfer impedance and higher electroactive surface area of the CuONCs. Notably, an unexpected peak appeared in the cyclic voltammograms when the pH was <4 for the CuONCs and <3 for the CuONSs. For this phenomenon, UV-Vis spectra, zeta potential, and size distribution experiments demonstrated changes in the two CuO nanostructures at lower pH, illustrating that CuONSs can tolerate a higher pH as compared to CuONCs. The multiple comparisons between the two nanomaterials presented here can provide references for the selection of electrochemical sensing materials.

AB The systemic use of tranexamic acid (TA) as an oral drug can bring adverse reactions, while intradermal injection leads to pain and a risk of infection. Moreover, it is difficult for highly hydrophilic TA to penetrate the skin barrier that contains lots of hydrophobic lipid compounds, which poses enormous restrictions on its topical application. Current transdermal TA delivery strategies are suffering from low drug load rates, plus their synthesis complexity, time-consumption, etc. adding to the difficulty of TA topical application in clinical therapeutics. To increase the penetration of TA, a novel approach using TA-loaded ZIF-8 (TA@ZIF-8) is developed. The encapsulation efficiency of TA@ZIF-8 reaches approximate to 25% through physical adsorption and chemical bonding of TA indicates by theoretical simulation and the improved TA penetration is elevated through activating the aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) protein. Additionally, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate the preponderance of TA@ZIF-8 for penetration ability and the advantages in intracellular uptake, minor cytotoxicity, and inhibition of melanogenesis and inflammatory factors. Moreover, clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of TA@ZIF-8 in the treatment of melasma and rosacea. This work presents a potential topical application of TA, free from the safety concerns associated with systemic drug administration.
   The present study encapsulates tranexamic acid (TA) into ZIF-8 (TA@ZIF-8) via the coprecipitation approach for enhanced transdermal delivery. The results demonstrate that TA@ZIF-8 penetrates the skin barrier to the dermis by activating the aquaporin-3 (AQP-3) and exhibits excellent properties in mitigating pigmentation and inflammation, which delivers a multidimensional therapy for melasma and rosacea. image

AB We report a step-economic strategy for the direct synthesis of spiro polycyclic N-heterocycles and indolecarbazole-fused naphthoquinones by merging oxidative coupling and cascade palladium-catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cyclization. In the protocol, bi-indolylnaphthoquinones were first synthesized by oxidative coupling of indoles and naphthoquinones. Subsequent cascade palladium-catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cyclization of bi-indolylnaphthoquinones gave spiro polycyclic N-heterocycles and indolecarbazoles. The intramolecular oxidative cyclization approach could also be realized by the presence or absence of iron catalysts under standard conditions. This protocol is featured with moderate to excellent yields, a wide substrate scope, and divergent structures of products.

AB In this work, by first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural, photoelectric, and catalytic properties of g-ZnO/Hf2CO2 vdW heterostructures to explore highly efficient photocatalysts of water splitting. Results show that the AA-stacking g-ZnO/Hf2CO2 vdW heterostructure (AA-HS) with an indirect bandgap of 1.738 eV has a typical type-II band alignment, which is benefit to effectively separate the photogenerated carriers into different layers and prevent their recombination. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of AA-HS straddling the water redox potentials makes it satisfies the requirements of photocatalytic water splitting at pH = 7. In addition, to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of AA-HS during oxidation evolution reaction (OER) process in water splitting, we calculated the change of Gibbs free energies of the intermediates on heterostructure under different conditions. Results show the Gibbs free energy decreases continuously at pH = 7 and U = 1.93 V. What's more, the AA-HS has good sunlight-absorption ability. External biaxial strain is not conducive to improving catalytic performance of AA-HS.

AB Objective Waste sorting has received considerable attention in recent decades. However, research on the mechanisms underlying the relationships among cultural worldview, environmental risk perception, and waste sorting is rather scarce. This study aims to explore the cultural worldviews, environmental risk perception, and waste sorting among urban Chinese and their mechanisms.Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving 744 urban Chinese residents (371 men and 373 women). A questionnaire was utilized to measure cultural worldviews, environmental risk perception, and waste sorting. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to examine the relationship between cultural worldviews, perceptions of environmental risk, and waste sorting.Results Waste sorting had a relatively insignificant negative relationship with fatalism and individualism. The correlation between environmental risk perception and cultural worldviews was negative except for egalitarianism, and the correlation between hierarchy and environmental risk perception was higher than the others, while individualism was higher than fatalism. Heightened environmental risk perception mediates the relationship between egalitarianism and waste sorting. Reduced environmental risk perception mediates the relationship between hierarchy and waste sorting, and mediates the relationship between individualism and waste sorting.Conclusion These new findings provide initial support for the mediating role of environmental risk perception in the relationship between cultural worldviews and waste sorting. Both theoretical and practical implications for understanding the psychological mechanisms of waste sorting are discussed.

AB An organic-inorganic hybrid is a promising electrode material for aqueous batteries due to its larger potential in improving electrochemical performance. Herein, we designed and prepared a naphthoquinone@FeOx(OH)/iron foam (NQ@FeOx(OH)/IF) hybrid electrode as a highly-efficient anode in Ni/Fe batteries via combining electro-deposition of FeOx(OH) and in situ hydrothermal growth of naphthoquinone. The as-prepared hybrid electrode materials present a 2D nanosheet morphology of FeOx(OH) and a branch/band-like structure of NQ, with the formation of NQ-FeOx(OH) interfaces. Such an interface structure is revealed to have more electron active sites, with increased electron delocalization caused by the aromatic ring structure, thereby enhancing the transport of the electrons in the electrode materials. Thus, a superior electrochemical performance of the NQ@FeOx(OH)/IF electrode was received, with a large areal capacity of similar to 2.23 mA h cm(-2) and a favorable rate capability of 1.09 mA h cm(-2) at 40 mA cm(-2). Besides, the NQ@FeOx(OH)/IF anode was coupled with the NiCo2O4 cathode to assemble a Ni/Fe battery, as a result, an admirable energy density of 235.2 W h kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 5.4 kW kg(-1) were obtained. The study on high-performance NQ@FeOx(OH)/IF electrode materials paves the way to design and synthesize better iron-based materials for Ni/Fe batteries.

AB The effect of tea polyphenols (TP) on the physicochemical, structural and digestive properties of Cynanchum auriculatum Royle ex Wight starch (C. auriculatum starch) was studied. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that a looser and more porous structure was observed in C. auriculatum starch-TP. Rheological results revealed that G' and G'' of C. auriculatum starch were decreased with TP addition. X-ray diffraction pattern showed TP could inhibit the relative crystallinity structure of C. auriculatum starch, thereby delaying the retrogradation of starch. Fourier-transform infrared analysis confirmed that TP and C. auriculatum starch molecules formed non-inclusive complexes through hydrogen bonding interaction. Moreover, TP could reduce the digestibility of the gelatinised C. auriculatum starch. These findings provide a theoretical information on C. auriculatum starch as a functional ingredient for regulating the postprandial glycemic response of starchy foods.

AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in hepatocytes (nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)), and lobular inflammation and hepatocyte damage (which characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are found in most patients). A subset of patients will gradually develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a deadly disease that threatens human life worldwide. Ferroptosis, a novel nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of reactive oxygen radicals and lipid peroxides, is closely related to NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD due to its multicomponent, multipathway and multitarget characteristics. In this review, we discuss the effect of TCM on NAFLD by regulating ferroptosis, in order to provide reference for the further development and application of therapeutic drugs to treat NAFLD.

AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are always contaminated by various mixed noise, which degrades the quality of acquired images and seriously affects the subsequent extensive applications. Total variation (TV) is popular for its capability of preserving details and promoting smoothness in HSI denoising. However, TV may cause over-smoothness and details loss. To tackle the above problems, we propose a double sparsity TV and low-rank representation denoising model (LRDSTV) for the mixed noise removal. Specifically, the double sparsity TV means fiber sparsity with sparse fibers in the gradient domain, promoting piecewise smooth structures and properly using the spatial information of the HSI. Moreover, we utilize the weighted nuclear norm to explore the low-rank property of mode -3 unfolding of the HSI, taking advantage of the spectral correlation and helping maintain more details to avoid oversmoothing. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied for the optimization of the LRDSTV model. Finally, a series of denoising experiments on simulated and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with some state -of -the -art algorithms.

AB Gentiana szechenyii Kanitz. and Gentiana veitchiorum Hemsl. are two wild medicinal plants widely used in Tibetan medicine. In recent decades, their wild populations have declined rapidly due to persistent over-harvesting of their flowers. Because their flowers are small and dense, it is difficult to rely on manual counting under wild conditions. The combination of deep learning and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (UAVRS) is a new method for plant surveys. We trained 12 of the most advanced or widely used YOLO models on a custom dataset to achieve quantitative detection of both plant flowers in UAVRS images. The accuracy, precision and recall of G. szechenyii Flower (GSF) detection can reach 97.00%, 90.40% and 95.40%, respectively (based on YOLOv7). Similarly, those of G. veitchiorum Flower (GVF) detection can reach 93.40%, 91.30% and 90.60%, respectively (based on YOLOv5n), and the highest mAP can reach 94.90% (based on YOLOv5m). Based on the detection results, it is calculated that the total yield of dried GSF and GVF that can be harvested as medicinal materials in study area ranges from 1.88 to 2.10 g center dot m(-2) and 4.42-4.62 g center dot m(-2), respectively. The results show that deep learning and UAVRS can be used for quantitative detection of GSF and GVF, which is helpful for further research and protection of these two plants.

AB An asymmetric Michael/Friedel-Crafts cascade reaction with Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) nitroallylic esters and 3-pyrrolyloxindoles has been developed for the stereoselective construction of spirooxindole-containing tetrahydroindolizines. A range of tetracyclic scaffolds possessing three consecutive chiral centers, including an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter, were generated in 53-85% isolated yields with high diastereoselectivities and enantiopurities (>= 3:1 dr, 50-98% ee). A newly synthesized bifunctional secondary amine/squaramide organocatalyst was demonstrated to exhibit better stereochemical control than their tertiary analogues.

AB The influence of different levels of sodium chloride, sodium nitrite, and glucose on the quality characteristics of spontaneously fermented goat meat sausage was investigated. The amounts of total biogenic amines in all the sausages ranged from 324.70 to 388.77 mg/kg; among them, spermine was the most abundant, with amounts ranging from 230.96 to 275.78 mg/kg. Increasing sodium chloride from 15 to 35 g/kg, the content of cadaverine, putrescine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and total amines decreased, and Enterobacteriaceae counts decreased at the same time. Increasing sodium nitrite from 150 to 250 mg/kg, the content of cadaverine, histamine, and total amines decreased, while Enterobacteriaceae counts decreased simultaneously. Increasing glucose from 10 to 40 g/kg, the content of cadaverine, spermidine, and total amines decreased. Enterococcus was the most abundant genus across all the samples, and the relative abundance of Enterococcus was reduced obviously by increasing sodium nitrite and glucose levels. The top 10 differential bacterial taxa for each additive group were respectively obtained, and microbial biomarkers for each level of additive within its group were acquired, respectively. Through Pearson correlation, Lactobacillus was positively correlated with phenylethylamine, tryptamine, tyramine, and cadaverine, Bacteroides and Sediminibacterium were positively correlated with phenylethylamine and putrescine, respectively, suggesting they have the potential to produce biogenic amines. The results provided references for controlling the accumulation of biogenic amines in fermented goat meat sausage via the addition of auxiliary additives during the processing.

AB With the rapid development of nuclear industry, how to effectively treat radioactive wastewater is an urgent problem that needs to be solved, especially the treatment of radioactive iodine, which has high volatility and strong diffusion. Here, porous crosslinked cyclodextrin microspheres (P-CDMs) with size around 300 mu m have been developed through crosslinking and electrospraying. The P-CDMs show a high capacity to remove I2, I-, and IO3- from aqueous solution and the maximum absorption can reach 668, 205 and 131 mg g-1, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption is stable in harsh condition (pH = 1.0, 75 degrees C), which is generally the iodine-bearing nuclear waste condition. P-CDMs also show excellent recycling performance and the adsorption performance remain over 99% after recycle 5 times. Therefore, P-CDMs can be considered as an effective adsorbent for the removal radioactive iodine from nuclear wastewater.

AB Probiotic bacteria could be administrated to broilers using the in ovo injection technique during 17.50 and 19.20 d of incubation to accelerate microbial maturation in the intestinal tract. The effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) injected in-ovo on intestinal morphology, mRNA expressions of intestinal health -related genes, and selected intestinal microbial of yellow broilers with or without Eimeria challenge were studied. A total of 360 yellow broiler hatching eggs were randomly assigned into 6 treatments with 60 replicate eggs per treatment. Six treatments were arranged in a 3 (LR dosage at 0, 106, and 108 CFU/egg at 18.5 d of incubation)  pound 2 (Eimeria oocyst challenge vs. PBS challenge at 10 d of age) factorial design. Tissues and cecal contents were sampled on d 19 posthatch. Our results indicated that the coccidial infection increased duodenum, jejunum, and liver relative weights to body weight, duodenal crypt depth, and HSP90 expression, and reduced goblet cell density and Occludin expression. In ovo injection of LR at 106 CFU/egg downregulated the Occludin expression and increased the Clostridium perfringens level in Eimeria-challenged broilers. When the LR dosage increased to 108 CFU/egg, relative weights of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and liver increased, villus length of lower small intestine and cecal Lactobacillus abundance in challenged broilers were reduced, and the Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens abundances in unchallenged broilers were increased. In summary, in ovo injection of LR at a dosage equal to or higher than 106 CFU per egg exacerbated coccidial infection in the intestinal tract and resulted in cecal bacterial imbalance. The probiotic dosage must be considered for in ovo administration in broiler production.

TI Retroviral Insertion Polymorphism (RIP) of Porcine Endogenous
   Retroviruses (PERVs) in Pig Genomes
SO ANIMALS

AB Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are one of the superfamilies of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) in mice and humans. Approximately 8% of the pig genome is composed of sequences derived from LTRs. While the majority of ERVs in pigs have decayed, a small number of full-length copies can still mobilize within the genome. This study investigated the unexplored retroviral insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) generated by the mobilization of full-length ERVs (Fl-ERVs), and evaluated their impact on phenotypic variation to gain insights into the biological role of Fl-ERVs in pigs. Overall, 39 RIPs (insertions or deletions relative to the pig reference genome) generated by Fl-ERVs were predicted by comparative genomic analysis, and 18 of them were confirmed by PCR detection. Four RIP sites (D5, D14, D15, and D18) were further evaluated by population analysis, and all of them displayed polymorphisms in multiple breeds. The RIP site of ERV-D14, which is a Fl-ERV inserted in the STAB2-like gene, was further confirmed by sequencing. Population analysis of the polymorphic site of ERV-D14 reveals that it presents moderate polymorphism information in the Large White pig breed, and the association analysis reveals that the RIP of ERV-D14 is associated with age variations at 30 kg body weight (p < 0.05) and 100 kg body weight (p < 0.01) in the population of Large White pigs (N = 480). Furthermore, the ERV-D14 RIP is associated with changes in the expression of the target gene STAB2-like in the liver, backfat, and leaf fat in Sushan pigs. These data suggest that some Fl-ERVs are still mobilizing in the pig's genome, and contribute to genomic and phenotypic variations.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Background and object: Mitotic count (MC) is a critical histological parameter for accurately assessing the degree of invasiveness in breast cancer, holding significant clinical value for cancer treatment and prognosis. However, accurately identifying mitotic cells poses a challenge due to their morphological and size diversity.Objective: We propose a novel end-to-end deep-learning method for identifying mitotic cells in breast cancer pathological images, with the aim of enhancing the performance of recognizing mitotic cells.Methods: We introduced the Dilated Cascading Network (DilCasNet) composed of detection and classification stages. To enhance the model's ability to capture distant feature dependencies in mitotic cells, we devised a novel Dilated Contextual Attention Module (DiCoA) that utilizes sparse global attention during the detection. For reclassifying mitotic cell areas localized in the detection stage, we integrate the EfficientNet-B7 and VGG16 pre-trained models (InPreMo) in the classification step.Results: Based on the canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) mitosis dataset, DilCasNet demonstrates superior overall performance compared to the benchmark model. The specific metrics of the model's performance are as follows: F1 score of 82.9%, Precision of 82.6%, and Recall of 83.2%. With the incorporation of the DiCoA attention module, the model exhibited an improvement of over 3.5% in the F1 during the detection stage.Conclusion: The DilCasNet achieved a favorable detection performance of mitotic cells in breast cancer and provides a solution for detecting mitotic cells in pathological images of other cancers.

AB In the study, the protective effects of wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGH) on the ethanol-induced injury in yeast cells were investigated, and the peptides that enhanced the resistance to 10% (v/v) ethanol-stress were identified. Results showed that the growth and viability of yeast under ethanol-stress were significantly enhanced by WGH, and it indicated that there were high activity fractions in WGH. Interestingly, eight wheat gluten peptides (WGP) were obtained and identified as EP, LL, LW, LPL, LML, LLL, LLW, and EFPL, respectively, and five (LL, LLL, LW, LML and EP) of them worked best. Furthermore, WGP could enhance the yeast resistance to ethanolstress, and the WGP apparently maintained the morphology and structure (especially the cell walls and membranes) of yeast under ethanol-stress. Further studied found that WGP (especially LL and LW) contributed to increasing cell wall integrity and cell membrane fluidity while also reducing cell membrane permeability. TEM analysis found that due to the existence of LL and LW, both the thickness of cell wall and the integrity of cell membrane were enhanced, on the contrary, the cell membrane degradation and cytoplasmic efflux were reduced. These results revealed that WGP could be considered as an effective protector of yeast against ethanol-stress damage.

AB Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) necroptosis is critical to disrupt the alveolar barrier and provoke acute lung injury (ALI). Here, we define calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the most abundant endogenous neuropeptide in the lung, as a novel modulator of AEC necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Upon LPS-induced ALI, overexpression of Cgrp significantly mitigates the inflammatory response, alleviates lung tissue damage, and decreases AEC necroptosis. Similarly, CGRP alleviated AEC necroptosis under the LPS challenge in vitro. Previously, we identified that long optic atrophy 1 (L-OPA1) deficiency mediates mitochondrial fragmentation, leading to AEC necroptosis. In this study, we discovered that CGRP positively regulated mitochondrial fusion through stabilizing L-OPA1. Mechanistically, we elucidate that CGRP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Furthermore, the blockade of AMPK compromised the protective effect of CGRP against AEC necroptosis following the LPS challenge. Our study suggests that CRGP-mediated activation of the AMPK/L-OPA1 axis may have potent therapeutic benefits for patients with ALI or other diseases with necroptosis.
   Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), the most abundant endogenous neuropeptide in the lung, has been identified as a novel modulator of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). CGRP promotes mitochondrial fusion, restores mitochondrial function, and inhibits necroptosis of LPS-treated AECs by activating the AMPK-long optic atrophy 1 (L-OPA1) pathway. This mechanism ultimately contributes to the alleviation of ALI.image

With the assumption of the considered vector field being a one-to-one mapping, we established the equivalence between the locally asymptotic stability and the existence of a max-separable Lyapunov function on a compact set. This result is an extension of that of discrete-time monotone linear systems. Furthermore, it is a counterpart of continuous-time monotone nonlinear systems.

AB Introduction: Problematic internet use (PIU) is a significant issue during adolescence. It is recognized as a condition for further study in the DSM-5 and may also be a consequence of underlying psychopathologies, as suggested by previous studies. Poor family communication is an important predictor of adolescent PIU. However, it remains unclear how family communication impacts adolescent PIU from the perspective of underlying psychopathologies. This study tested the chain mediating effect of loneliness and depression as well as the moderating effect of developmental stage in this chain mediation model to uncover the mechanisms underlying this association. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited a total of 1,377 participants (53% male) from 23 provinces across China, all aged 12 to 17. Family communication was assessed using the FCS-10, which measures aspects such as openness, emotional expression, and problem-solving abilities within family interactions. PIU was assessed using the PIUQ-SF-6, loneliness was measured by the T-ILS, and depression was assessed using the PHQ-9. The chain mediating effects were tested using bias-corrected percentile bootstrap (sample = 5000). Results: The results indicated that (a) poor family communication was positively associated with adolescent PIU; (b) loneliness and depression mediated the link between family communication and adolescent PIU; (c) loneliness and depression sequentially mediated the link between family communication and adolescent PIU; (d) the developmental stage of adolescence (early vs late) moderated the relationship between depression and PIU in the chain mediation model. Conclusion: This study reveals that depression, as a potential underlying psychopathology, may precede PIU. It also establishes a link between family communication and PIU, showing that loneliness resulting from poor family communication contributes to the development of depression in adolescents. The connection between depression and PIU is particularly pronounced in late adolescence. These findings highlight the importance of addressing underlying psychopathologies when screening and treating adolescent PIU.

DT Article
DE Meat rabbits; production performance; immunity; oxidation resistance
AB 144 New Zealand weaned rabbits weighing (769.74 +/- 67.32 g) were randomly chosen and divided into 3 groups by single factor design: The control group, compound essential oil group and oregano oil group, with 16 replicates in each group and 3 rabbits in each replicate. Different groups were fed with basic diet, basic diet + 300mg/kg compound essential oil and basic diet thorn 300mg/kg oregano oil respectively. The pre-feeding period is 5 days and the formal period is 42 days. The test results are as follows:(1) The feed intake of the compound essential oil group was higher than that of the control group and oregano oil group (p<0.01), and the daily weight gain and feed/gain (F/G) ratio were not significantly different among the groups (p>0.05); (2) The diarrhoea index and frequency in the compound essential oil group and oregano oil group were respectively, lower than control group (p<0.01), and the mortality rate was 31.03% and 41.67% (p<0.05); (3) The content of immunoglobin G (IgG) in blood of compound essential oil group was 35.39% and 28.57% higher than that of the control group and oregano oil group (p<0.01), but there was no significant difference between immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) groups (p>0.05); (4) The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme in oregano oil group was significantly higher than that of the control group and the compound essential oil group (p<0.01). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the compound essential oil group was 30.81% lower than control group (p<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the compound essential oil group and the oregano oil group. The contents of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity(T-AOC) were not significant differences among groups (p>0.05); (5) The economic benefits of the compound essential oil group and the oregano oil group were better than that of the control group. To sum up, both compound essential oil and oregano oil can not only improve the immunity and antioxidant capacity of weaned rabbits, but can also reduce the rate of diarrhoea and mortality as well as improve the economic benefits of farm animal.

TI Functional characterization of a TerC family protein of Riemerella
   anatipestifer in manganese detoxification and virulence
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY

AB Manganese (Mn) is an essential element for bacteria, but the overload of manganese is toxic. In a previous study, we showed that the cation diffusion facilitator protein MetA and the resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump MetB are responsible for Mn efflux in the bacterial pathogen Riemerella anatipestifer CH-1. However, whether this bacterium encodes additional manganese efflux proteins is unclear. In this study, we show that R. anatipestifer CH-1 encodes a tellurium resistance C (TerC) family protein with low similarity to other characterized TerC family proteins. Compared to the wild type (WT), the terC mutant of R. anatipestifer CH-1 (triangle terC) is sensitive to Mn(II) intoxication. The ability of TerC to export manganese is higher than that of MetB but lower than that of MetA. Consistently, terC deletion (triangle terC) led to intracellular accumulation of Mn2+ under excess manganese conditions. Further study showed that triangle terC was more sensitive than the WT to the oxidant hypoclorite but not to hydrogen peroxide. Mutagenesis studies showed that the mutant at amino acid sites of Glu116 (E116), Asp122 (D122), Glu245 (E245) Asp248 (D248), and Asp254 (D254) may be involved in the ability of TerC to export manganese. The transcription of terC was upregulated under excess manganese and downregulated under iron-limited conditions. However, this was not dependent on the manganese metabolism regulator MetR. In contrast to a strain lacking the manganese efflux pump MetA or MetB, the terC mutant is attenuated in virulence in a duckling model of infection due to increased sensitivity to duck serum. Finally, comparative analysis showed that homologs of TerC are distributed across the bacterial kingdom, suggesting that TerC exerts a conserved manganese efflux function.

AB Aim: This study explored the protective effect of Enterococcus faecium as a probiotic against Salmonella typhimurium infection. Materials & methods: The protective role of E. faecium against tissue damage by S. typhimurium infection and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and tight junction proteins were detected by histological observation, real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical methods. Results: E. faecium demonstrated a regulatory function that affected the expression of Claudin-1 and enhanced tight junctions, suppressed the NF-kappa B/NLRP3/IL-1 beta signaling pathway and reduced the release of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TLR4 and MYD88 and inflammatory damage to tissues by S. typhimurium in the duodenum, cecum and colon of mice. Conclusion: E. faecium antagonized S. Typhimurium alleviating inflammatory injury in mice through the NF-kappa B/NLRP3/IL-1 beta signaling pathway.

AB Separation of thermodynamically-stable emulsions is of great significance, yet challenging due to the low efficiency and membrane fouling associated with existing methods. Inspired by the water-collection functionality of the hierarchically-structured back of desert beetles, we fabricated a novel inversely beetle-back-like copper mesh membrane, featuring superhydrophobic bumps on a superhydrophilic surface to facilitate the capture aggregation of tiny oil droplets in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. Such membrane was composed of super hydrophobic (SH) Bi2MoO6 microparticles-dotted superhydrophilic polyacrylic acid/chitosan-coated CuC2O4 nanosheet arrays on copper mesh membranes. A cross-flow asymmetric filtration (CAF) device was constructed using the as-prepared membrane to continuously and efficiently separate O/W emulsions. The dispersed oil droplets were captured and coalesced by SH Bi2MoO6 on the superhydrophilic nanoarrays, then detached from the mesh membrane. Simultaneously, the continuous water phase could permeate freely through the mesh pores. The combination of the SH Bi2MoO6-dotted superhydrophilic membrane and CAF device ensured an excellent separation efficiency with an average water permeation flux of 2.7 kL m- 2 h-1 for different surfactant-stabilized O/W emulsions and oil residual contents in the filtrate being less than 40 mg L-1. Moreover, the cross-flow of the feed solution in the CAF system strengthened the separation of the coalesced oil phase on the membrane surface, thus preventing the formation of a filter cake caused by the aggregation of emulsified oil droplets.

AB BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on public health, prompting scholarly research in related fields. In this context, the present study reveals the psychological characteristics of adolescents in ethnic minority areas of China approximately five months after the 2020 outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, explores the relationship between intrusive rumination and academic burnout, and examines the role of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and cognitive reappraisal in the relationship to provide an empirical foundation for developing effective psychological interventions for adolescents in the wake of the pandemic.MethodsBased on cluster sampling, 941 middle school students (65.36% female, 74.71% senior high, Mage=15.95) in ethnic minority areas of China were surveyed using the Event Related Rumination Scale, Adolescent Academic Burnout Scale, Post-traumatic Stress Checklist Scale, Emotion Regulation Strategy Scale, and a self-designed demographic questionnaire.ResultsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, 7.44% of Chinese ethnic minority adolescents in our study sample were classified as PTSD positive, and 10.95% exhibited partial PTSD. Intrusive rumination significantly predicted academic burnout, and PTSS played a key mediating role between the two, accounting for 58.51% of the total effect. After controlling for PTSS, cognitive reappraisal moderated the effects of intrusive rumination on academic burnout. Specifically, the effect of intrusive rumination on academic burnout decreased with improvement in cognitive reappraisal.ConclusionsIntrusive rumination indirectly affected academic burnout in adolescents through PTSS as a crucial mediator, and the remnant direct effect was alleviated by cognitive reappraisal. This finding emphasises the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach that encompasses cognitive, emotional, and physiological symptoms to understand and address academic burnout among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Both Manganese (Mn2+) and MSA-2 can activate the downstream signal pathway through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and induce the expression of type I interferon, which is important for hosts to protect against DNA viruses. However, its effect on RNA viruses remains unknown. In this study, we used Seneca Valley virus (SVV) as a model RNA virus to investigate the inhibitory effects of Mn2+ and MSA-2 on the virus replication in the porcine cells (PK-15 cells). The results showed that both MSA-2 and Mn2+ were able to inhibit the SVV replication in PK-15 cells. The combination of MAS-2 and Mn2+ could confer better protection against SVV. Further studies showed that MSA-2 and Mn2+ could activate TBK1, IRF3 and NF kappa B through STING and induce the expression of IFN-beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The present study confirmed that MSA-2 synergized with Mn2+ in STING activation to generate a better antiviral effect in vitro, which would be helpful for the further development of effective antiviral drugs in the future.

AB Outstanding high-temperature resistance, thermal stability, and dielectric properties are fundamental for dielectric materials used in harsh environments. Herein, TiO2 nanoparticles are decorated on the surface of BN nanosheets by internal crosslinking between polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), forming three-dimensional novel nanohybrids with a rough surface. Then, an ether nitrile (PEN) matrix is introduced into the polyarylene to form polymer-based nanocomposite dielectric films. Meanwhile, the structure and micromorphology of the newly prepared nanohybrids, as well as the dielectric and thermal properties of PEN nanocomposites, are investigated in detail. The results indicate that TiO2 nanoparticles tightly attach to the surface of BN, creating a new nanohybrid that significantly enhances the comprehensive performance of PEN nanocomposites. Specifically, compared to pure PEN, the nanocomposite film with a nanofiller content of 40 wt% exhibited an 8 degrees C improvement in the glass transition temperature (T-g) and a 162% enhancement in the dielectric constant at 1 kHz. Moreover, the dielectric constant-temperature coefficient of the nanocomposite films remained below 5.1 x 10(-4) degrees C-1 within the temperature range of 25-160 degrees C, demonstrating excellent thermal resistance. This work offers a method for preparing highly thermal-resistant dielectric nanocomposites suitable for application in elevated temperature environments.

AB Although many approaches have been implemented to tailor the strain in potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ferroelectrics, they still suffer from poor strain compared to shape memory alloys and giant magnetostrictive materials. Herein, a strategy of periodic orthogonal poling is implemented in KNN-based ceramics with multiphase boundaries, and the correlation between the amount of non-180(o) domain and strain is established, revealing that the mechanisms of interfacial stresses facilitate reversible domain switching during the periodic orthogonal poling. Owing to the self-generated interfacial stresses between the adjacent regions with different poling directions, an enhanced strain benefits from non-180(o) domain switching, which is reversible during periodic orthogonal poling. The enhancement in strain decreases from O-T to R-O-T to the R-T phase boundary, which corresponds to the different quantity of the non-180 degrees domain, indicating that a large amount of non-180 degrees domains can further boost high strain under periodic orthogonal poling. Notably, a slight frequency-dependent strain was observed across the frequency range of 1-50 Hz. Therefore, an ideal strain can be further induced by enhancing the amount of reversible non-180(o) domain switching in the multiphase boundary during periodic orthogonal poling, which can serve as a guide for the design of high-performance KNN materials.

AB This paper mainly examines the performance of the tail risk (TR) constructed by 19 sub-categories of commodity price indices for predicting gold futures market volatility. Under the framework of the AR model, we compared the predictive capabilities of AR-type models incorporating the TR indicator as an additional explanatory variable against the AR benchmark model without the TR indicator. Our findings reveal that the incorporation of the TR indicator significantly improves the predictive accuracy of the gold futures volatility model. Notably, this enhancement is particularly pronounced during periods of heightened volatility.

AB Electrocaloric (EC) refrigeration materials have seen significant progress recently, with efficient Barium titanatebased (BT-based) lead-free materials particularly promising for microelectronics applications. However, their performance still lags behind their lead-based counterparts, highlighting the need for further improvements. This study employs a novel density adjustment strategy (DAS) to enhance the EC performance of (0.5-x)BCT-BTZxBST ceramics by carefully balancing the relationships among density, dielectric breakdown strength (BDS), and Delta T. Although Delta T intuitively decreases with increasing density, enhanced BDS can partially compensate for this decrease. An excellent EC performance with Delta T of 2.21 K and Delta T/Delta E of 0.471 K mm kV-1 is obtained in x = 0.5, together with a broader temperature span of 50.3 degrees C near room temperature, which surpasses or is comparable to other lead-free or lead-based ones. The results suggest that the DAS provides a promising approach for developing efficient EC, making speediness of application in EC devices.

AB The investigation of chemical reactions during ion irradiation is a frontier for the study of the ion-material interaction. In order to probe the chemistry of ion produced nanoclusters, valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS) was exploited to investigate Ga+ ion damage in Al2O3, InP, and InGaAs, where each target material has been shown to react differently to the interaction between impinging ions, recoil atoms, and vacancies: metallic Ga, ternary InGaP clusters, and metallic In clusters are formed in Al2O3, InP, and InGaAs, respectively. Supporting simulations based on Monte Carlo and crystal orbital Hamiltonian calculations indicate that the chemical constitution of cascade induced nano-precipitates is a result of a competition between interstitial/vacancy consumption rates and preferential bond formation due to differing bond strengths.

AB Numerous Mesozoic granitoid plutons with a substantial variety of petrologic and geochemical signatures intrude the Triassic metasedimentary rocks of the Songpan-Ganze accretionary-orogenic wedge in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. These granitoid rocks generally exhibit sharp contact with the Triassic sedimentary rocks. To better understand the genesis and emplacement of magmas associated with tectonic accretion along convergent plate boundaries, we present new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb geochronology, major and trace elements, and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions for intermediate-to-felsic plutons in the Yajiang gneiss dome group (YGDG), including the Changzheng pluton, the Jiajika (Majingzi) pluton, the Rongxuka pluton, the Xiya pluton, the Xinduqiao pluton, and the Waduo diorite dikes in the eastern margin of the Songpan-Ganze orogenic belt (SGOB). By their typical petrological and geochemical characteristics, these plutons are classified as I-type granodiorite-diorite (Rongxuka, Xiya, Xinduqiao plutons, Waduo dikes) or S-type granite (Changzheng and Jiajika plutons). I-type granodiorite-diorites exhibit a high Mg# (average 49), medium-K cala-alkiline signature and are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements (e.g., Rb, Th, and U) but depleted in high field strength elements (e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti), and with lower initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values (0.70622 to 0.70863) but a relatively high and concentrated epsilon(Hf)(t) (-27 to-1.9) and e(Nd)(t) (-4.02 to-7.51); while S-type granites exhibit a high silica, high-K cala-alkiline signature with strong negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.17-0.64), and possess high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 values but low epsilon(Hf)(t) (-40.1 to-0.9) and epsilon(Nd)(t) (-8.72 to-12.14) signatures, forming through partial melting of metasedimentary rocks from an ancient crust source. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating indicates that they were emplacement between 207.2 +/- 1.4 and 223.6 +/- 2.2 Ma. Both types of granitoid rock were formed by the crustal partial melting followed by extensive fractional crystallization under high-temperature (700-850 degrees C), lowpressure (<15 kb) conditions. In combination with previous studies, our data provide evidence for an affinity between the eastern Songpan-Ganze andthe Yangtze craton basements, and suggest that the granitoid plutons formed in a syn-collisional to post-collisional setting at ca. 207-223 Ma.

AB Nutrient addition has a significant impact on plant growth and nutrient cycling. Yet, the understanding of how the addition of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) significantly affects soil gross N transformations and N availability in temperate desert steppes is still limited. Therefore, a 15N tracing experiment was conducted to study these processes and their underlying mechanism in a desert steppe soil that had been supplemented with N and P for 4 years in northwestern China. Soil N mineralization was increased significantly by P addition, and N and P additions significantly promoted soil autotrophic nitrification, rather than NH4+-N immobilization. The addition of N promoted dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+, while that of P inhibited it. Soil NO3--N production was greatly increased by N added alone and by that of N and P combined, while net NH4+-N production was decreased by these treatments. Soil N mineralization was primarily mediated by pH, P content or organic carbon, while soil NH4+-N content regulated autotrophic nitrification mainly, and this process was mainly controlled by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria rather than archaea and comammox. NH4+-N immobilization was mainly affected by functional microorganisms, the abundance of narG gene and comammox Ntsp-amoA. In conclusion, gross N transformations in the temperate desert steppe largely depended on soil inorganic N, P contents and related functional microorganisms. Soil acidification plays a more key role in N mineralization than other environmental factors or functional microorganisms.

AB The traditional fixed slope compensation can solve the problem of sub-harmonic oscillation phenomenon in the current-mode controlled single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) switching converter, however, the stability operation range is limited. To overcome this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive slope compensation technology. Taking SIDO boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM) as an example, the operation principle and control sequence with adaptive slope compensation are analyzed in detail. Based on this, a five-dimensional discrete iterative mapping model is established, and the bifurcation characteristics of the converter under different operating conditions are presented. The research results show that compared with traditional fixed slope compensation technology, the proposed adaptive slope compensation technology can expand the stability range. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation and experiment results.

AB Long-acting and specific targeting are two important properties of excellent drug delivery systems. Currently, the long-acting strategies based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) are controversial, and PEGylation is incapable of simultaneously possessing targeting ability. Thus, it is crucial to identify and develop approaches to produce long-acting and targeted drug delivery systems. Sialic acid (SA) is an endogenous, negatively charged, ninecarbon monosaccharide. SA not only mediates immune escape in the body but also binds to numerous disease related targets. This suggests a potential strategy, namely "sialylation," for preparing long-acting and targeted drug delivery systems. This review focuses on the application status of SA-based long-acting and targeted agents as a reference for subsequent research.

AB Meat tenderness is an important sensory index when consumers choose meat products, which determines the value of meat products and consumers' buying intentions. Yak meat is rich in nutrition and unique in flavor, which is favored by consumers. However, its meat has the deficiencies of low tenderness and poor taste, which has a negative impact on the value of its meat products and customer satisfaction. To identify the genes affecting the yak meat tenderness, we used RNA-seq to analyze the longissimus dorsi muscle of yaks with different tenderness, screened a total of 1120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Meanwhile, 23 pathways were significantly enriched. By further analysis, we identified eight genes related to yak meat tenderness (WNT5A, ARID5B, SERPINE1 KLHL40, RUNX1, MAFF, RFX7 and ARID5A). Notably, SERPINE1 was involved in the significant enrichment pathways of 'complement and coagulation cascade pathway', 'HIF-1 signaling pathway' and 'AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications' which can regulate meat tenderness. This implies that SERPINE1 may play an important regulatory role among them. The DEGs associated with yak meat quality screened in this work will be helpful to identify potential biomarkers related to meat tenderness.

AB As one of the most promising eco-friendly piezoelectric materials, potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics prepared via a phase engineering strategy have recently received considerable attention. Surprisingly, the different piezoelectric properties can also be obtained in KNN-based ceramics even with the same phase coexistence, illustrating that the mechanisms of improved properties have not been sufficiently addressed apart from phase coexistence, especially the role of the characteristics of individual elements in the modification of structure and performance. Herein, a group of BiMO3-doped KNN-based ceramics was designed to probe the qualitative correlation between ionic characteristics (ionic radius and electronegativity) and structure as well as multiferroic properties. Due to the different efficiency of ion on shifting phase transition temperatures, the R-T phase boundary with varying R and T phase fractions is displayed in BM ceramics, while the evolution of relaxor behaviour is ascribed to the decreased grain size resulting from the enhanced ionic radii of Ga3+, Fe3+, and Sc3+. Owing to the distinction in the covalence fraction caused by the electronegativity, d33 first increased and then decreased from BG to BF to BS ceramics. The superimposed effect of the T-phase fraction, c/a ratio, and covalence fraction dominates the evolution of the temperature-dependent normalised electric properties. Additionally, higher magnetic properties are beneficial for the super-exchange interactions occurring with the -Fe-O-Nb-O-Fe- pathways in BF ceramics. Therefore, exploring the role of characteristics for individual elements in the structure and performance is helpful for sufficiently understand the doping mechanism.

AB Simple Summary Rape straw has been used as livestock feedstuff in many countries, but the low digestibility caused by the high degree of lignification has limited its application in ruminant diets. Numerous techniques have been employed to enhance the nutritional quality of rape straw, including physical, chemical, and microbial methods. Among these, anaerobic alkaline storage is particularly effective in improving the straw's nutritional value and preventing mold growth. To improve the utilization efficiency of rape straw, anaerobic calcium oxide alkalization was conducted, and advanced molecular spectroscopy was applied, to detect the internal molecular structural changes. The calcium oxide treatment increased the contents of soluble fiber, improved the ruminal degradability of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, and decreased the contents of indigestible fiber. Alterations in cellulosic compounds' spectral regions were highly correlated with the differences in carbohydrate chemical constituents and the ruminal digestibility of rape straw, which indicated that the infrared techniques could be used to evaluate the carbohydrate nutritive properties. The results of this study showed that calcium oxide treatment and anaerobic storage changed the molecular characteristics and improved the nutritive properties of rape straw. To improve the utilization efficiency of rape straw, anaerobic calcium oxide (CaO) alkalization was conducted, and advanced molecular spectroscopy was applied, to detect the internal molecular structural changes. Rape straw was treated with different combinations of CaO (3%, 5%, and 7%) and moisture levels (50% and 60%) and stored under anaerobic conditions. We investigated the carbohydrate chemical constituents, the ruminal neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) degradation kinetics, and the carbohydrate molecular structural features. CaO-treated groups were higher (p < 0.05) for ash, Ca, non-fiber carbohydrate, soluble fiber, and the ruminal degradability of aNDF and ADF. In contrast, they were lower (p < 0.05) for the contents of aNDF, ADF, and indigestible fiber. With CaO levels rising from 3% to 7%, the content of aNDF and ADF linearly decreased (p < 0.05). CaO treatment and anaerobic storage changed the molecular characteristics, including structural parameters related to total carbohydrates (TC), cellulosic compounds (CEC), and structural carbohydrates (STC). Alterations in cellulosic compounds' spectral regions were highly correlated with the differences in carbohydrate chemical constituents and the ruminal digestibility of rape straw. In summary, CaO treatment and anaerobic storage altered the molecular structural parameters of carbohydrates, leading to an enhancement in the effective degradability (ED) of aNDF and ADF in rape straw. From the perspective of processing cost and effectiveness, 5% CaO + 60% moisture could be suggested as a recommended treatment combination.

AB The kinetic theory is employed to analyze influence of agent competence and psychological factors on investment decision-making. We assume that the wealth held by agents in the financial market is non-negative, and agents set their own investment strategies. The herding behavior is considered when analyzing the impact of an agent's psychological factors on investment decision-making. A nonlinear Boltzmann model containing herding behavior, agent competence and irrational behavior is employed to investigate investment decision-making. To characterize the agent's irrational behavior, we utilize a value function which includes current and ideal-investment decisions to describe the agent's irrational behavior. Employing the asymptotic procedure, we obtain the Fokker-Planck equation from the Boltzmann equation. Numerical results and the stationary solution of the obtained Fokker-Planck equation illustrate how herding behavior, agent competence, psychological factors, and irrational behavior affect investment decision-making, i.e., herding behavior has both advantages and disadvantages for investment decision-making, and the agent's competence to invest helps the agent to increase income and to reduce loss.

AB As an important means of production and habitation, land is the core natural resource for people's life and production. However, the escalating demand for land resources, along with population growth, has created a pressing challenge at the intersection of land, population, and grain. In this study, we used a combination of temporal and spatial perspectives, along with spatial analysis methods, to analyze the supply and demand of land resources in the Northeast Farming-Pastoral Ecotone (NFPE) based on the population-grain relationship. The results show that the carrying capacity of land resources in this region increased gradually and the number of people it can carry increased from 34.23 million (2000) to 127.96 million (2018). From 2000 to 2018, the land resource carrying index (LRCI) was greater than 1.125, showing a state of surplus in grain, and the LRCI increased by 0.23 per year. Most areas in this region are in a state of grain surplus, with 13 counties showing a population and grain balance, and 2 counties being overpopulated. However, the increasing trend of land resource carrying capacity of the overpopulated areas and the balanced population-grain areas are notable. The carrying capacity of land resources in the NFPE generally exhibits a positive trend with a surplus of grain; however, there are spatial variations. Areas in the south and northeast demonstrate lower change trends, while the north and southeast exhibit higher change trends. This research provides critical insights into the dynamic interplay between land, population, and grain, enabling informed decision making for sustainable development in the NFPE and offering valuable lessons for similar regions globally.

AB Ubiquitination is a widespread post-transcriptional modification (PTM) that occurs during protein degradation in eukaryotes and participates in almost all physiological and pathological processes, including animal adipogenesis. Ubiquitination is a cascade reaction regulated by the activating enzyme E1, conjugating enzyme E2, and ligase E3. Several recent studies have reported that E3 ligases play important regulatory roles in adipogenesis. However, as a key influencing factor for the recognition and connection between the substrate and ubiquitin during ubiquitination, its regulatory role in adipogenesis has not received adequate attention. In this review, we summarize the E3s' regulation and modification targets in animal adipogenesis, explain the regulatory mechanisms in lipogenic-related pathways, and further analyze the existing positive results to provide research directions of guiding significance for further studies on the regulatory mechanisms of E3s in animal adipogenesis.

AB The emergence of Goose astrovirus (GoAstV) has led to the gout in geese. This study aimed to isolate and identify the GoAstV from diseased goslings in Sichuan Province, China, followed by per-forming whole genome phylogenetic analysis of the iso-late. The GoAstV was successfully isolated by inoculating the diseased gosling liver and kidney homog-enate into the 11-day-old goose embryo allantoic cavity for 3 passages, and the isolate was named as GoAstV-C2 strain. The virus particles were spherical, without cap-sule, and the size was about 28 nm under transmission electronic microscope. The complete genome length of GoAstV-C2 was 7.035 nt, and the whole genome sequence phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belongs to the GoAstV genotype II (GoAstV-II) subgenotype IIc. The isolated GoAstV-C2 strain was able to be stably passaged in the goose embryo and uric acid sedimenta-tion was observed. The complete genome bioinformation of GoAstV-C2 determined the evolutionary characteris-tics of the GoAstV isolated from Sichuan, China. This finding lays a foundation for the development of preven-tive measures, effective vaccines, and therapeutic drugs.

AB This study examines the impact of the Chinese regional emission trading system (ETS) pilots on enterprise transformation from the perspective of diversification. We use data on Chinese A-share listed companies from 2004 to 2021, and adopt the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) and difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) models. The empirical results show that first, the ETS significantly increases the product quantity and revenue diversification of regulated firms. Second, the ETS promotes enterprise diversification through three channels: emission cost, emission risk, and market efficiency. Third, the ETS has a greater impact on the diversification of state-owned enterprises, firms with high business concentration, and firms with low innovation investment. Fourth, the ETS-driven diversification has not been successful as it has increased firms' costs and reduced their profitability. We recommend introducing industrial policies to guide the transformation of enterprises, encourage them to improve their innovation capabilities, and choose appropriate transformation strategies.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Seam carving is an outstanding content-aware image resizing technique. When the resizing ratio is relatively lower, seam carving can achieve image resizing without leaving any visual obvious artifacts. However, it may also be used for malicious purposes, such as changing image semantic content by object removal. Seam caving changes the relationship between neighboring pixels, thus seam carved images should be different from natural ones. Inspired by this, an end-to-end seam carving detection network, namely SCDNet, is proposed to detect seam carved images. To highlight seam carving artifacts, a pre-processing layer, namely the subtractive pixel adjacency module, is designed as the first layer of SCDNet. Then, 16 residual blocks with shortcut learn features from the input, and a spatial pyramid pooling module is embedded at the end of the residual block to generate fixed-length features, which can eliminate the requirement of fixed-resolution input images for existing deep models. Finally, the features are fed into the fully-connected layer for final classification. In addition, to expose seam carved images with a small carving ratio, a transfer learning strategy is exploited to gradually clarify the artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCDNet obtains better detection accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, especially for seam carving with small scaling ratios.

AB Owing to the demand for sustainable development, a lot of attention has been received by eco-friendly lead-free KNN based ceramics. Although a series of breakthroughs have been achieved in their electric properties, their poor temperature stability still hinders their practical application. A KNN-based ceramic of (1-x) K0.54Na0.46NbO3-xBi(0.5)Na(0.5)ZrO(3) (KNN-xBNZ) was designed to solve the issue of temperature-dependent degradation while taking advantage of the synergistic effect at the ferroelectric-to-relaxor cross region. A mixed-phase boundary, including tetragonal and pseudocubic phases, is observed in all samples, and the dominant phase structure gradually transforms from a tetragonal phase to a pseudocubic phase as BNZ increases. A favorable strain performance (strain >= 0.08%, and temperature stability >= 95.35%) is observed at the temperature range of 20-180 degrees C, profiting from the synergistic effect at the ferroelectric-to-relaxor cross region at x = 0.08. It is superior or comparable to some typical NN-based, KNN-based, and PZT-based materials regardless of the driving electric field. These results would shed light on the future work of achieving excellent comprehensive performance in KNN-based materials.

AB In order to discover novel anti-pulmonary fibrosis agents, a series of novel pirfenidone derivatives were designed and synthesized. All compounds were investigated for their anti-pulmonary activity and characterized by C-13 and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Preliminary studies on their biological activity showed that all target compounds showed different degrees of inhibition on pulmonary fibrosis, and most of the derivatives were significantly better than pirfenidone.

AB Soil bacterial and fungal communities play different roles in maintaining the ecosystem structure and functions. However, these differences, which are related to soil depths, remain unclear and are the subject of this study. We selected six sample plots (20 m x 50 m) in a natural Picea crassifolia forest in an alpine meadow to determine the vertical patterns (0 similar to 10 cm, 10 similar to 20 cm, 20 similar to 30 cm, and 30 similar to 50 cm) of soil bacterial and fungal communities, and to predict their potential functions. The phyla Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria dominated the soil bacteria, with more than 50% of the relative abundance, while the fungi Basidiomycota and Ascomycota dominated the soil fungi. The potential functions of bacteria, including metabolism and transcription, increased with soil depth, and corresponded to specific bacterial taxa. The functional guilds of fungi, including endophytes, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and ectomycorrhiza, did not change with soil depth. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were the key drivers shaping the soil bacterial communities and potential functions in the 0-50 cm soil layer. SOC was also a key driver of soil fungal beta diversity. The sample plot, namely, its geographic locations, was another key driver shaping soil fungal b diversity and potential functions, but soil depth was not. Our results differentiate the importance of SOC and geographic location in shaping soil bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, and indicate that examining soil microbial composition and corresponding functions concomitantly is important for the maintenance and management of forest ecosystem functions.

AB Copper is the third most abundant essential transition metal ion in the human body. It ' s responsible for important activities in many living things, but excessive intake of Cu2+ can lead to a range of diseases. A colorimetric and turn-off fluorescent probe (E)-2-(5-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-2-(diethylamino)-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-N-phenylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide (ZTR) was designed and synthesized by thiosemicarbazone Schiff base as a specific complexes site strategy to achieve highly specific Cu2+ detection. The fluorescence of the probe ZTR solution fell dramatically when Cu2+ was added, and its appearance changed from dazzling blue to nearly colorless. The simple structure and readily available fluorescent probe provide a novel approach for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ in the linear range from 0 to 0.12 mu M, with a detection limit down to 16 nM, and with high selectivity for Cu2+ over 15 other metal ions. Job's plot analysis showed that probe ZTR and Cu2+ formed a 1:1 coordination complex. In addition, because of its low detection limits and fast response time, the created fluorescent molecule was effectively used to study the target ions on test paper strips and in water samples.))

AB Integrating wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) into low-power internet of things (IoT) is a promising technique to achieve sustainable cities and society. However, the main design challenge for WPCNs is the low efficiency of wireless energy transfer. To address this challenge, this paper investigates active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted WPCNs, where the reflecting beamforming gain of active RIS can be utilized to enhance wireless energy and information transmissions. We formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem that jointly optimizes time-slot allocation, transmit power control, and reflection parameters of RIS. Due to the highly coupled variables and fractional structure of the energy efficiency expression, we develop an alternating optimization method to solve it through utilizing the Dinkelbach-type method and block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by the proposed method for active RIS-assisted WPCNs, as compared to the passive RIS-assisted method and the counterpart without the aid of RIS.

AB Cyclopropyl groups are widely found in pharmaceutical products and their application as precursors or key reaction intermediates benefits the development of a wide range of reactions. Herein, we report a facile protocol for the synthesis of this compound through gold-catalyzed [2 + 1] cycloaddition of allenamides with sulfoxonium ylides. The reaction exhibited good functional group tolerance and high efficiency, affording the products in good to excellent yields with good diastereoisomerism. The steric hindrance between the sulfonamide group and the gold catalyst determined the major configuration of the formed cis-cyclopropane product. Moreover, the aldehyde could be converted to amide under Schmidt reaction conditions and alcohol under reduction conditions.

AB The formation mechanism of SiO2 aggregates is controversial because two contrasting hypotheses are often proposed to explain plant silicification. In this review, we summarize the physicochemical fundamentals of amorphous silica nucleation and discuss how plants regulate the process of silicification by influencing the thermodynamics and kinetics of silica nucleation. At silicification positions, plants overcome the thermodynamic barrier by establishing the supersaturation of the H4SiO4 solution and reducing the interfacial free energy. Among the thermodynamic-drivers, the establishment of supersaturation of H4SiO4 solution mainly depends on the expression of Si transporters for H4SiO4 supply, evapotranspiration for concentrating Si, and the other solutes in H4SiO4 solution for influencing the dissolution equilibrium of SiO2; while the interfacial free energy was reduced seemingly by the overexpression Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1 in high NaCl-stressed rice. Moreover, some kinetic-drivers, such as silicification-related proteins (Slp1 and PRP1) and new cell wall components, are actively expressed or synthesized by plants to interact with silicic acid, thereby reducing the kinetic barrier. According to classical nucleation theory, when the thermodynamic barrier is overcome, the super-saturated silicic acid so-lution (such as H4SiO4 in xylem sap) does not necessarily have to precipitate, just has the potential ability to precipitation. Thus, based on the mediators of SiO2 deposition at the thermodynamic-driven stage, it is difficult to evaluate whether the process of plant silicification is active or passive. We conclude that the characteristics of kinetic-drivers determine the mechanism of plant silicification.

AB The atomic-layer misorientation during the growth of a 5 mu m thick AlN thin film on a patterned (0001) sapphire substrate was investigated by the scan rotation approach using a probe aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope at a nanometer scale. Through the geometrical phase analysis of the resulting twisted atomic structure at different depths below the top surface, it is shown that over 10% of local tensile and compressive strain is balanced in a 1.6 degrees twist of the c-planes within the first micron of AlN growth. As a consequence, the formation of threading dislocations is reduced. The in-plane twist is seen to decrease toward the layer surface down to 0.5 degrees. Finally, growth has adopted the conventional step flow mechanism with a reduced density of emerging dislocations by the thickness of 5 mu m. Our finding forecasts the possibility of understanding the relationship between atomic bilayer twist and local strain accommodation at a nanometer scale, which could provide guidance for achieving better crystal quality of AlN thin films on patterned substrates during epitaxy.

AB Robot online inspection is a new technology for nondestructive and quantitative detection corrosion of vertical storage tank without emptying the liquid. The storage tank safety assessment methods for robot online inspection are still at the exploratory stage of development. An online inspection robot has been developed by the authors. This paper studies the evaluation methods of bottom plate corrosion with this robot detection. Aiming to characterize localized corrosion and pitting corrosion, multi-angle evaluation indices are proposed. Mathematical models based on reliability evaluation are derived. Above models and evaluation methods are then validated by a case study. Assessment results show that the maximum corrosion depth of storage tank floor is 2.44 mm, the residual useful life of the storage tank is 5 years, and the center coordinates of localized corrosion region of numbered A is (0.58 m, - 0.01 m), the area is 0.484 m(2), and the average corrosion depth is 2.03 mm. Abundant quantitative conclusions are obtained by using the proposed evaluation methods, instead of rough qualitative descriptions. This research provides references for storage tank safety assessments and formation standard based on robot online inspection.

AB In the study, monodispersed silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with an average diameter of 9.57 nm were efficiently and controllably biosynthesized by a reductase from Fusarium solani DO7 only in the presence of beta-NADPH and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The reductase responsible for AgNP formation in F. solani DO7 was further confirmed as 1,4-alpha-glucosidase. Meanwhile, based on the debate on the antibacterial mechanism of AgNPs, this study elucidated in further depth that antibacterial action of AgNPs was achieved by absorbing to the cell membrane and destabilizing the membrane, leading to cell death. Moreover, AgNPs could accelerate the catalytic reaction of 4-nitroaniline, and 86.9% of 4-nitroaniline was converted to p-phenylene diamine in only 20 min by AgNPs of controllable size and morphology. Our study highlights a simple, green, and cost-effective process for biosynthesizing AgNPs with uniform sizes and excellent antibacterial activity and catalytic reduction of 4-nitroaniline.

AB Aortic dissection (AD) is one of the most frequent types of aortic disease with extremely poor prognosis. The biological signaling gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has exhibited protective effects in various types of cardiovascular diseases. However, as a toxic, colorless gas, the application of H2S is immensely hampered due to the lack of ideal donors. In this article, a drug delivery system with a H2S donor has been prepared. Meanwhile, the donor could be deposed in a cysteine-containing environment to generate H2S. The results indicate that the H2S donor polymer nanomicelles mitigated the processive transformation of smooth muscle cells effectively in a proper concentration range, which may play a protective role in aortic dissection. In animal experiments, the sustained-release H2S donor stimulated in the presence of cysteine was found to demonstrate beneficial effects in a murine model of aortic dissection and would likely become a potential target of H2S therapy for cardiovascular diseases.

AB Herein, a label-free, sensitive, and selective fluorescence probe for the detection of trace nitrite in water sample by metal-organic cages (ZrT-1-NH2) was reported. The fluorescence emission of as-prepared ZrT-1-NH2 was 450 nm upon the excitation of 373 nm with a quantum yield of about 8.6%, which can be quenched by the addition of nitrite. The proposed sensor owned the advantages of high sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.5 mu M), quick response (100 s), and excellent selectivity in the presence of various ions. The fluorescence quenching was due to the diazotization and reduction reaction of -NH2 with the preliminary studying. Under the optimized condition, the sensor was successfully exemplified by real water samples and comparative performance was achieved.

AB The key to gene therapy is the design of biocompatible and efficient delivery systems. In this work, a glutathione (GSH)-activated aggregation-induced-emission (AIE) cationic amphiphilic lipid, termed QM-SS-KK, was prepared for nonviral gene delivery. QM-SS-KK was composed of a hydrophilic biocompatible lysine tripeptide headgroup, a GSH-triggered disulfide linkage, and a hydrophobic AIE fluorophore QM-OH (QM: quinoline-malononitrile) tail. The peptide moiety could not only efficiently compact DNA but also well modulate the dispersion properties of QM-SS-KK, leading to the fluorescence-off state before GSH treatment. The cleavage of disulfide in QM-SS-KK by GSH generated AIE signals in situ with a tracking ability. The liposomes consisted of QM-SS-KK, and 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (QM-SS-KK/DOPE) delivered plasmid DNAs (pDNAs) into cells with high efficiency. In particular, QM-SS-KK/DOPE had an enhanced transfection efficiency (TE) in the presence of 10% serum, which was two times higher than that of the commercial transfection agent PEI25K. These results highlighted the great potential of peptide and QM-based fluorescence AIE lipids for gene delivery applications.

AB A one-step strategy for synthesizing fluorescent copper clusters stabilized by l-cysteine has been successfully established in aqueous solutions. The direct determination of copper ions was realized by the fluorescence enhancement phenomenon caused by the preparation and aggregation process. At the same time, ammonia treatment can lead to rapid fluorescence quenching, resulting from the influence on the aggregation behavior of Cu clusters, while the fluorescence can be recovered by the continuous addition of copper ions. Therefore, a recyclable fluorescence sensing system is constructed for the simultaneous determination of copper ions and ammonia. This method is simple, anti-interference and has been successfully applied to the determination of environmental samples.

AB Recently, due to the ability to exploit perceptual information, superpixel-based methods have received attention for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. However, existing superpixel-based denoising methods unfold the irregular 3-D superpixels into the matrices along the spectral mode, which inevitably destroys the intrinsic structure of the irregular 3-D superpixels. To tackle the irregular 3-D superpixels, we introduce the irregular tensor representation for superpixel-guided HSI denoising. More concretely, by introducing the weighted tensor, we suggest a tensor representation of each irregular 3-D superpixel, which can preserve the intrinsic structure of the irregular 3-D superpixel. Equipped with the irregular tensor representation, we establish a superpixel-guided tensor optimization model for HSI denoising, which simultaneously exploits the perceptual information and low-rank structure within 3-D superpixels. To solve the resulting tensor optimization problem, we develop an inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier (IALM) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods, particularly matrix-based methods, on both simulated and real data.

AB Components of metabolic syndrome might be predictors of the therapeutic outcome of psychiatric symptom in schizophrenia, whereas clinical results are inconsistent and an intrinsic therapeutic link between weaker psychiatric symptoms and emergent metabolic syndrome remains unclear. This study aims to reveal the relationship and illustrate potential mechanism by exploring the alteration of cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia patients with comorbidity metabolic syndrome. Thirty-six schizophrenia patients with comorbidity of metabolic syndrome (SCZ-MetS), 45 schizophrenia patients without metabolic syndrome (SCZ-nMetS) and 39 healthy controls (HC) were recruited in this study. We constructed FC map of cerebello-cortical circuit and used moderation effect analysis to reveal complicated relationship among FC, psychiatric symptom and metabolic disturbance. Components of metabolic syndrome were significantly correlated with positive symptom score and negative symptom score. Importantly, the dysconnectivity between cognitive module of cerebellum and left middle frontal gyrus in SCZ-nMetS was recuperative increased in SCZ-MetS, and was significantly correlated with general symptom score. Finally, we observed significant moderation effect of body mass index on this correlation. The present findings further supported the potential relationship between emergence of metabolic syndrome and weaker psychiatric symptom, and provided neuroimaging evidence. The mechanism of intrinsic therapeutic link involved functional change of cerebello-cortical circuit.

AB Pancreatic cancer is a rare but fatal disease. Patients present advanced disease due to the lack of or typical symptoms when the tumor is still localized. A high-quality image processing system has been in practice to detect the pancreatic tumor and determine the possibility of surgery, and preoperative methods, such as ERCP are increasingly used to complement the staging modality. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is one of the complicated surgeries with potential morbidity. The minimally invasive pancreatic resections, both robot-assisted and laparoscopic, have become a part of standard surgical practice worldwide over the last decade. Moreover, advancements in adjuvant chemotherapy have improved the long-term outcomes in current clinical practice. The systemic conservative treatment, including targeted agents, remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced disease. An increasing number of studies are focused on modulating the pancreatic tumor microenvironment to improve the efficacy of the immunotherapeutic strategies. Herein, the role of preoperative therapy, the novel surgical strategy, and individualized systemic treatment in pancreatic cancer is investigated. Also, the randomized controlled studies that have defined the neoadjuvant and surgical management of pancreatic cancer have been summarized.

AB In the motor drive system of electric vehicles, there are some nonlinear factors, such as the deadtime and the conduction voltage drop of switching devices, which will generate low-order harmonics of the stator current and the torque ripple. The frequency of the harmonic may coincide with the natural frequency of the motor, so resonance may occur on the motor drive system. To reduce the noise caused by motor resonance, the characteristics of harmonic distortion caused by the deadtime, and the conduction voltage drop of the switching device, are analyzed firstly. Then, a motor vector control strategy with specific low order is proposed. The sixth-order harmonic resonance controller in d-q axis is introduced into the control loop, and the parameter designing principle of the controller is also presented. Without affecting the control performance of the current loop, the sixth-order harmonic of the stator current near the natural frequency can be significantly suppressed. Finally, the simulation and the experiment are carried out to certify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed harmonic suppression method.

AB Context. Oleic acid together with insulin is widely used to induce preadipocyte differentiation in humans and mammals, and is also used alone in chicken preadipocytes from abdominal adipose tissue. However, it is not clear whether oleic acid alone promotes goat primary intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation. Aims. The aim of the present study was to identify the role of oleic acid in regulating primary preadipocyte differentiation in goats. Methods. Three healthy, 7-day-old Jianzhou goats were randomly selected. After slaughter, the longissimus dorsi tissues were collected from each goat under sterile procedures and mixed equally. The primary preadipocytes were then prepared using collagenase type I digestion, and treated with 5 mg/L insulin or different concentrations of oleic acid, including 0 mu M, 50 mu M, 100 mu M, 150 mu M and 300 mu M. The results were determined using microscopy and Oil Red O staining. The expression of genes related to preadipocyte differentiation were determined by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results. Lower concentrations of oleic acid (50 mu M, 100 mu M and 150 mu M) did not affect the cell morphology and cell growth, whereas 300 mu M oleic acid led to severe cytotoxicity compared with the control (0 mu M). The treatment of oleic acid (100 mu M) enhanced cellular accumulation and lipid droplets deposition significantly, which was not affected by supplementary insulin. In addition, insulin alone treatment did not alter cellular adipogenesis in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Treatment with oleic acid significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha and fatty acid binding protein 4, and decreased the expression of lipoprotein esterase on Day 2 after cell differentiation, all of which decreased continually on Day 4 and Day 6. Expression of all genes increased significantly on Day 8 after oleic acid treatment in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Conclusion. The results underscore the role of oleic acid independent of insulin in promoting intramuscular preadipocytes in goats, and probably via the control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha. Implications. These data provide insight into the mechanism underlying preadipocyte differentiation.

AB Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs) are a type of important ovarian somatic cells that carries out various functions related to oogenesis, follicular development and embryogenesis. The study on the development and function of CGCs facilitates the understanding of reproductive regulation in female animals. Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) is a member of the sirtuin family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases mediating numerous biological processes. In this study, we detected the localization of SIRT7 in yak ovaries as well as explored the function of SiRT7 in yak CGCs. The results revealed that the SIRT7 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of oocytes, granulosa cells and theca cells. The knockdown of SIRT7 in yak CGCs repressed cell proliferation and impacted the expressions of several apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, oestrogen synthesis was also inhibited in SIRT7-deficient yak CGCs. The expressions of several sterogenesis-related genes decreased significantly following SIRT7 knockdown. In addition, the lack of SIRT7 in yak CGCs resulted in decreased levels of the TGFB/SMAD family members TGFB1, TGFBR1 SMAD2 and SMAD3. Moreover, the activation of the TGFB/SMAD pathway by adding TGFB/SMAD pathway activator SRI-011381 partially rescued the level of oestrogen secreted by SIRT7-deficient yak CGCs, as well as the expressions of steroidogenesis-related genes NR5A1 and CYP19A1. This research is the first to focus on the role of SIRT7 in yak ovary, and the outcomes offer new insights into the mechanism governing yak reproduction.

AB In order to reduce the switching loss and cost, as well as improve the reliability of the induction motor (IM) drive system, the technology involving the three-phase current reconstruction of 60 degrees discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM2) is studied in this paper. According to the analysis of the switching state for DPWM2 in different sectors, the three-phase current can be constructed by sampling the voltage of the DC-link resistor. When the target voltage vector is located near the sector boundary or in the low-modulation area, the duration of the active vector in the sampling period is less than the voltage sampling time, which leads to measurement errors of the DC-link current. Therefore, on the basis of the switching state in different unmeasured areas, a time compensation method combining phase shifting and frequency reduction is proposed, and the expressions for comparing values are derived. Lastly, a simulation model and an experimental platform are established to validate the accuracy of the proposed method.

AB Although urbanization has been widely examined in individual city and urban agglomeration scales, urban expansion patterns and dynamics in large-scale agricultural districts remain absent. In this study, multifaceted characteristics in urban expansion were quantified in China's nine national-level agricultural districts, and responses of dry-wet circum- stances to urban sprawl were evaluated. From 1980 to 2018, China has undergone an extensive urban sprawl. Huang - Huai-Hai Plain (HHHP) has the maximum urban coverage extent, followed by Middle-lower Yangtze Plain (MLYP) and Southern China (SC). The largest annual increase was recorded in MLYP, reaching 816.12 km2; followed by HHHP, with an annual increase of 725.22 km2. There are prominent heterogeneities in expansion rate and direction among various districts. The dominating growth patterns were edge- and leapfrogging-expansion, accompanying by a less per- centage of infilling-expansion. Accompanying by urbanization, connectedness in urban landscapes gradually im- proved, while separation degree decreased. Upon many occasions, holistic average dry-wet circumstances in non - urbanized areas are superior to those in urban areas, although this is not absolute for all the districts or periods. In ur- banization progress, the development of leapfrogging-expansion has a potential to ameliorate dry-wet circumstances in both urban and non-urban zones, while infilling- and edge-expansion would constitute an inverse effect. In compar- ison to urban zones, leapfrogging-expansion would cause a more prominent effect on dry-wet environment in non - urbanized zones. Increased connectivity in urbanized landscapes would improve dry-wet environments, especially for urbanized zones. Inversely, increased spatial separated extent among urban landscapes would perform an opposite effect. This study provides a potential for understanding the dynamic features of urban expansion in large-scale agri- cultural districts. Moreover, the results can also provide a potential opportunity for optimizing dry-wet environments by regulating urbanization pattern and landscape configuration.

AB A novel reactive fluorescent hydrogen sulphide (H2S) probe (T-DNBS) consisting of 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNBS) units has been synthesised from 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole. Adding H2S to probe T-DNBS solution resulted in a marked fluorescence increase accompanied by a visual colour change from colourless to pale red. Probe T-DNBS performed excellent sensitivity and selectivity for H2S, substantial fluorescence enhancement, can be detected quantitatively in the concentration range of 0-125 mu M and the low detection limit was 77.78 nM. In addition, the probe T-DNBS can track H2S in red wine samples with high accuracy, high recovery and practical value in food analysis.

AB Owing to the excellent conversion properties between magnetic and electric properties, magnetoelectric composites have been widely used in devices. With the growing concerns about the environment, developing environmentally friendly lead-free magnetoelectric composites with high performance are very important. Here, (1-x)0.82Ba(Ti0.89Sn0.11)O-3-0.18(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3-xCoFe(2)O(4) [(1-x)BTS-BCT-xCFO] magnetoelectric composites are synthesized by solid-state method, and the effect of CFO on the microstructure and magnetoelectric properties is systematically studied. The perovskite type piezoelectric phase and spinel structured piezomagnetic phase in diffraction patterns are independent of each other. Due to the inhibiting effect of CFO on grain size for BTS-BCT, the grain size of magnetoelectric composites is dominated by CFO. The electric properties deteriorate, and magnetic properties increase with increasing CFO. Meanwhile, the optimal ME coefficients (alpha(E31)similar to 8.12 mV/ cm center dot Oe and alpha(E33)similar to 7.84 mV/cm center dot Oe) are obtained in the (1-x)BTS-BCT-xCFO with x = 0.20, which are superior or comparable to that of some lead-based and lead-free magnetoelectric composites. Therefore, (1-x)BTS-BCT-xCFO material systems have a promising prospect in application.

AB Species distributions are one of the fundamental factors needed for understanding and conserving wildlife. While the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the primary applied reference for biodiversity conservation, limitations in data availability and analyses of the distributions of some species may limit accurate threat classification assessments and conservation recommendations. Improving the accuracy of species distributions in light of growing data and analytical methods is a key step to increasing the efficacy of the Red List. In this study, we reassessed the distribution of takin (Budorcas taxicolor tibetana), a large ungulate in Sichuan Province, southwest China, classified by the IUCN as vulnerable. Using species distribution models and reported habitat requirements, we updated the takin distribution map. Our updated distribution range in the study area (79,449 km(2)) was 61.31% of the current distribution range (CDR) on the IUCN Red List. This reduction was in large part due to the inclusion in the CDR of substantial areas of lowland plains, high human disturbance, and non-forest habitat, which provide no suitable habitat for takin. According to our results, suitable takin habitat covered 18.97% of the CDR, suggesting a substantially overestimated distribution. However, there are high proportions of habitat (40%) still covered by the nature reserve network, indicating the importance of protected areas (PAs) in the conservation threaten species. We recommend that experts apply the basic approach presented herein to update the Red List distributions for more species to increase the accuracy of assessments and resulting conservation applications.

AB Ceramic membranes based on naturally available materials are cost-effective and environmentally friendly al-ternatives to substitute Nafion (TM) 117 as separator in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). In this study, copoly-merization doped marine biomass-based (Ostrea gigas tnunb shell, OGTS; Sea sand, SS) ceramic membrane separators (CMSs) modified by Cu/Fe are synthesized by sintering. Modified CMSs exhibit superior chemical properties of acid and alkali resistance and thermodynamic stability. For CMS-ASO-Cu (CMS-Al2O3/SS/OGTS/ Cu), Oxygen diffusion coefficient of 3.41 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) is 1.88 times higher than that of CMS-ASO-Fe (CMS-Al2O3/SS/OGTS/Fe). Proton transfer numbers of CMS-ASO-Cu is up to 0.62. Maximum power density 53.21 mW m(- 2) and current density 408.62 mA m(- 2) are achieved from CMS-ASO-Cu assisted BES, along with organic removal performance (COD > 80%, NH4+-N > 80%, TP > 92%). Regeneration and antibacterial properties of the CMSs are confirmed by low-temperature sintering method and inhibition zone assay, ensuring the long-term, efficient and sustainable function of the C-BES.

   bio- wastes (OGTS and SS) supported CMSs were successfully fabricated
   via low temperature sintering and obtained bioelectricity in BES. OGTS
   and SS were used as feedstock for CMS because of their easy availability
   and low cost. In proton transport and oxygen diffusion experiments, the
   CMS-ASO-Cu and CMS-ASO-Fe exhibited excellent performance. The C-BES
   with the CMS-ASO-Cu/CMS-ASO-Fe obtained a higher power den- sity and
   coulombic efficiency. The membrane contamination generated in the BES
   was removed by means of a low temperature ?secondary sintering?. These
   fascinating properties exhibited by CMS provide the direction for an
   alternative to PEM.

AB A total of 232 goat fecal samples (124 diarrheic and 108 nondiarrheic) collected from 12 farms in Southwest China were tested for astrovirus using RT-PCR. A total of 16.9% (21/124) of diarrheic and 20.4% (22/108) of nondiarrheic samples were astroviruspositive, and no statistical difference was found in the detection rate between healthy and sick goats. Furthermore, 28 obtained complete ORF2 sequences could be classified into six genotypes according to the species classification criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It is worth noting that, in addition to four known caprine astrovirus genotypes (MAstV-33, MAstV-34, Caprine Astrovirus G5.1, and Caprine Astrovirus G3.1), MAstV-13 and MAstV-24 genotypes were identified in goats. Interestingly, five of 19 ORF2 sequences in the Caprine Astrovirus G3.1 genotype showed possible intragenotypic recombination events. Furthermore, nearly complete caprine astrovirus genomes of MAstV-13 and MAstV-24 genotypes were obtained. The genome of the SWUN/ECJK3/2021 strain shared the highest similarity (62.0% to 73.9%) with astrovirus in MAstV-13, and clustered in the so-called human-mink-ovine (HMO) clade, which contained the majority of the neurotropic astrovirus strains. Moreover, the SWUN/LJK2-2/2020 strain showed the highest similarity (69.7% to 78.6%) and the closest genetic relationship to the known porcine and bovine astroviruses in MAstV-24. In conclusion, this study confirmed six genotypes of astrovirus circulating among goats in Southwest China, including MAstV-13 and MAstV-24 genotypes. These findings enhance our knowledge of the prevalence and diversity of astroviruses.
   IMPORTANCE Caprine astrovirus is a newly emerging virus, and information regarding its prevalence and molecular characteristics remains limited. In this study, six genotypes of astrovirus, including MAstV-13 and MAstV-24, were identified in goats, adding two novel caprine astrovirus genotypes to the four previously known genotypes, thereby enriching the diversity of the caprine astrovirus. Moreover, genomes of MAstV-13 SWUN/ECJK3/2021 and MAstV-24 SWUN/LJK2-2/2020 strains were obtained from goats, which aids in the understanding of the infection spectrum and host range of the two genotypes. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of neurotropic-like astrovirus (MAstV-13) in goats, which has significant implications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases in goats.

DE algae contamination; RTV-coated insulators; hydrophobicity
AB The surface of organic insulating materials such as room temperature vulcanized silicone rubber (RTV) coatings often has serious contamination deposition. In humid areas such as the Southwest region of China, algae contamination layers are present on the surface of the insulators. In this study, the geographical and creeping distribution of algae contamination on the surfaces of RTV insulators were studied by investigating and sampling various substations in the Southwest region. The main components of soluble salts in the contamination were studied by atomic absorption spectroscopy and ion chromatography. The algal genome was extracted by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method, and the species of algae and other microorganisms in the contamination layer were determined. The effects of algae or their secretions on the surface resistance and hydrophobicity were studied by quantitatively inoculating algae and smearing extracellular secretions on the RTV surface. The damage of the algae contamination layer to the microstructure of the silicone rubber was investigated by microscopic observation and thermogravimetric analysis. Results showed that the growth of algae was positively correlated with the surface contamination of RTV. The extracellular secretion of algae destroys the surface microstructure of RTV and causes the removal of alumina hydroxide, leading to the reduction of siloxane. Therefore, the resistance and hydrophobicity of the RTV surface were reduced. It is of great significance to study the characteristics and effects of the algae contamination layer for RTV maintenance.

AB A new class of species-permselective molecular sieves with functionalized nanowindows has been prepared by modifying the armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) of a pillared graphene membrane, namely windowed carbon nanotube membrane. The mechanism and characteristics of the windowed carbon nanotube membrane for the selective separation of the CO2/CH4 gas mixture are comprehensively and deeply studied. Selective gas separation has a great dependence not only on the interaction of the gas adsorbing on the graphene membrane and inside the CNT channel but also with the energy barrier for the gas diffusing through the nanowindow. In all the functional nanowindows investigated, CH4 is completely rejected by the N/F-modified nanowindows while maintaining extremely high CO2 permeability. The CO2 permeance of the nanowindows is as high as 10(9) GPU. It emerged that these windowed carbon nanotube membranes are efficient species-selective molecular sieves possessing excellent CO2/CH4 selectivity and brilliant CO2 capture capability.

AB The oral administration of a single formulation loaded with more than one natural medicine to treat chronic diseases has advantages such as convenience, effectiveness, and economy. Here, using biomaterials approved by the drug administration, we fabricated supramolecular nanovectors containing dual natural medicines to prevent gastric mucosal lesions. Nanovectors exhibited superior intestinal absorption and bioavailability, which might be due to their high dispersion, good muco-adhesiveness, blood-lymph circulation transport, lipid sensing, and protective effects. Molecular docking results clarified the possible mechanisms in aspects of efflux pump (p-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1) inhibition effects, metabolic enzyme (cytochrome P450 3A4/1A2) blocking effects, serum albumin deposit effects, and dual drug interaction effects. Nanovectors decreased ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions by lowering the gastric ulcer index, preventing oxidative damage, decreasing interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and malondialdehyde, increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and prostaglandin E2 levels. The interactions of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B or kappa B kinase-related proteins and dual drugs or nanovector components were simulated computationally to provide an understanding of the gastro-protective action mechanism. In all, industrializable supramolecular nanovectors could effectively co-deliver dual natural medicines via the oral route by improving the pharmacokinetic behavior and exerting protective efficacy of the gastric mucosa by decreasing the oxidative stress and inflammatory level.

AB A series of copper complexes derived from salen ligands bis(salicylaldimine) (L1), bis(pyrrole-2-carboxaldimine) (L2) and bis(pyridine-2-carboxaldimine) (L3) have been synthesized and encapsulated into the supercage of zeolite. These complexes were well investigated by various spectrochemical and physicochemical techniques with DFT calculations. Both free and encapsulated complexes were applied as catalyst to the degradation of methylene blue (MB) using H2O2 as oxidant. The alternation of coordinated sites N2O2 with N-4 causes the enhanced catalytic activity, which is attributed to the increased molecular planarity and lower oxidation states for the free complexes. Moreover, encapsulated complexes showed modified geometric, optical and catalytic properties due to electronic effects and steric constraints from the host zeolite supercage. The encapsulated complexes show high catalytic efficiency in organic dye degradation in a neutral condition compared to other encapsulated catalyst studied and show good resistance to radical scavenger. Encapsulated complexes CuL2-Y and CuL3-Y coordinated with N-4 sites, exhibiting enhanced catalytic reactivity and recyclability compared to free complexes in solution, which is important for the design of heterogeneous catalyst. The encapsulated complexes with the highest energy electronic band are more reactive. The zeolite and electronic effects from different coordination sphere play an important role in the functionality of the modified geometries.

The NC6-removed polymer films demonstrate anisotropic adsorption toward cationic dye methylene blue (MB) with a high adsorption capacity of 688 mg g(-1) under planar alignment. The specific pore dimension with anionic interior shows size- and charge-selectivity. The effects of pore size and pore charges on MB adsorption are investigated using the NC6-removed films with extra pores or non-charged pores, respectively. 5CB is used as the intermolecular template to produce extra nanopores. The obtained results show that the equilibrium adsorption capacity (q(e)) of MB onto the NC6/5CB template-removed film (T-removed film) does not increase evidently. Non-charged pores generated from the hydrochloric acid (HO) treatment of the NC6-removed film show poor dye adsorption, indicating that pore charges strongly affect MB adsorption because carboxylate groups act as the active adsorption sites and electrostatic interactions contribute to MB adsorption. Adsorption kinetics can be well described using the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Also, satisfactory regenerability of the functional polymer films can be achieved by simple HO treatment and ethanol washing. Such functional polymer films with desired pore dimensions and pore charges can serve as excellent adsorbents to effectively remove cationic contaminants from polluted water.

AB IFITM2 is interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2, which plays an extremely key role in anti-tumor and anti-virus diseases. In this study, the 602 bp cDNA sequence of the yak (Bos grunniens) IFITM2 (BgIFITM2) gene was obtained. Moreover, the prokaryotic expression vector of BgIFITM2 protein was constructed and expressed successfully, with a molecular weight of 33.680 kDa. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of HepG2 cells were significantly inhibited after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expressions of B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2)/BCL2-associated X (BAX) and molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes were significantly decreased, but the expressions of BAX gene were significantly increased after treatment with BgIFITM2 protein (0.1 and 1 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression of BAX protein was also significantly increased after treatment with 1 mu g/mL BgIFITM2 protein (P < 0.05). Finally, the addition of BgIFITM2 protein attenuated the formation of tumor lesions in mice, and the pathological damage of the lung was less than that in the model group. The expression of Ki67 protein in the model group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), but the expression of Ki67 protein in the BgIFITM2 group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). Taken together, BgIFITM2 protein could inhibit the proliferative activity of HepG2 cells by regulating apoptosis-related genes, and reduce the invasiveness of HepG2 cells in mice lung tissue. These results facilitate further studies on the function of BgIFITM2 protein.

AB As the main distribution place of deep-level defects and the entrance of water, the interface is critical to determining both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Suitable interface design can dramatically passivate interface defects and optimize energy level alignment for suppressing the nonradiative recombination and effectively extracting the photogenerated carriers towards higher PCE. Meanwhile, a proper interface design can also block the interface diffusion of ions for high operational stability. Therefore, interface modification is of great significance to make the PSCs more efficient and stable. Upon optimized material choices, the three-dimensional halide perovskite graded junction layer, low-dimensional halide perovskite interface layer and organic salt passivation layer have been constructed on perovskite films for superior PSCs, yet a systematic review of them is missing. Thus, a guide and summary of recent advances in modulating the perovskite films interface is necessary for the further development of more efficient interface modification.

TI Correction Method of Three-Axis Magnetic Sensor Based on DA-LM

DT Article
DE three-axis magnetic sensor; weak magnetic target; DA-LM algorithm;
   parameter estimation; error correction
AB The fluxgate magnetometer has the advantages of having a small volume and low power consumption and being light weight and is commonly used to detect weak magnetic targets, including ferrous metals, unexploded bombs (UXOs), and underground corrosion pipelines. However, the detection accuracy of the fluxgate magnetometer is affected by its own error. To obtain more accurate detection data, the sensor must be error-corrected before application. Previous researchers easily fell into the local minimum when solving error parameters. In this paper, the error correction method was proposed to tackle the problem, which combines the Dragonfly algorithm (DA) and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, thereby solving the problem of the LM algorithm and improving the accuracy of solving error parameters. Firstly, we analyzed the error sources of the three-axis magnetic sensor and established the error model. Then, the error parameters were solved by using the LM algorithm and DA-LM algorithm, respectively. In addition, by comparing the results of the two methods, we found that the error parameters solved by using the DA-LM algorithm were more accurate. Finally, the magnetic measurement data were corrected. The simulation results show that the DA-LM algorithm can accurately solve the error parameters of the triaxial magnetic sensor, proving the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the difference between the corrected and the ideal total value was decreased from 300 nT to 5 nT, which further verified the effectiveness of the DA-LM algorithm.

AB To probe the motivational roles of hedonic gratification and social gratification in giving "Like" feedback on social media, we developed a set of novel pictures to simulate WeChat Moments. We subsequently examined how the personality trait of extraversion and stimulus content characteristics (e.g., emotional valence, personal relevance) influenced "Liking" behavior. A 2 (extraversion: extrovert group vs. introvert group) x 3 (emotional valence: positive vs. neutral vs. negative) x 2 (personal relevance: personally relevant vs. personally irrelevant)-mixed experimental design was applied to data obtained from 56 WeChat Moments users. These participants included 28 individuals with the highest extraversion scale scores (the extrovert group), and 28 individuals with the lowest extraversion scale scores (the introvert group), according to the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Briefly, participants observed pictures on an interface similar to that of WeChat Moments and were given the option to "Like" each picture. "Like" rates and response time were then compared across groups and conditions by applying a mixed-design analysis of variance. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to explore relationships between the "Like" rates under each condition and the scores for each personality trait. Compared with the neutral pictures, the positive and negative pictures were "Liked" more and less frequently, respectively (F-2,F- 108 = 46.22, p < 0.001). Compared with the poster-unrelated pictures, the personally related pictures were "Liked" more frequently (F-1,F- 54 = 19.54, p < 0.001). In the extrovert group, the frequency of "Likes" given to unrelated negative content positively associated with neuroticism (r = 0.42, p = 0.025) and negatively associated with conscientiousness (r = -0.46, p = 0.014). No correlations were observed in the introvert group. Compared with not giving "Like" feedback, participants gave "Likes" to positive and negative pictures more quickly (p = 0.035) and slowly (p < 0.001), respectively.These results support the hypothesis that hedonic gratification and social gratification motivate "Like" feedback for positive content and personally related content, respectively. "Liking" behavior was not affected by extraversion, but was related to neuroticism and conscientiousness. Content-related differences in time intervals for giving "Like" feedback in this study suggest that people do not hesitate to give "Like" feedback to positive content on WeChat Moments, yet linger in deciding to give "Like" feedback to negative content.

AB Electronic medical records (EMR) have been commonly used in medical institutions in recent years. In particular, the combination of EMR and the cloud server has significantly improved the work efficiency and therapeutic level of the hospital. It also raises some security concerns, e.g., the information leaks. Blockchain has features including decentralization, traceability, openness, and tamper resistance. Therefore, the technology may be used to overcome the above flaws. In this paper, we introduce a new blockchain-assisted EMR in the cloud environment by using proxy reencryption and sequential multisignature. Firstly, blockchain makes the scheme have high-security performance without a trusty center. Secondly, we use proxy reencryption to protect personal medical data while helping doctors to access patients' historical medical records. Moreover, the doctors have used a sequential multisignature, which is practical and can effectively improve security performance. The analysis results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy various security features of EMR and has an ideal computational and communication cost. Finally, the scheme is implemented to show its performance.

AB Numerosity comparison for regular patterns shows different features compared with that for random ones in previous studies, suggesting an underlying mechanism distinct from numerosity. In this study, we went further to compare the event-related potentials (ERP) components in numerosity processing of random and regular patterns, which are identical in all aspects of texture features except for the distribution. ERP components were recorded and analyzed while participants compared which of the two successively presented sets was more numerous. P2p amplitude was revealed to be significantly weaker for regular patterns compared with that for random patterns over right occipital-parietal cites, whereas no difference was found for P1 or N1 components. The difference in P2p amplitude, which is consistent with the behavior dissociation revealed in our previous studies, suggests that regular distribution can trigger distinct processing in numeral comparison tasks. Processing of continuous magnitudes or configuration cannot explain the decrease in P2p amplitude for regular distributed patterns. Therefore, this study further supports that P2p is mediated by numerosity processing.

AB User experience of mobile apps is an essential ingredient that can influence the user base and app revenue. To ensure good user experience and assist app development, several prior studies resort to analysis of app reviews, a type of repository that directly reflects user opinions about the apps. Accurately responding to the app reviews is one of the ways to relieve user concerns and thus improve user experience. However, the response quality of the existing method relies on the pre-extracted features from other tools, including manually labelled keywords and predicted review sentiment, which may hinder the generalizability and flexibility of the method. In this article, we propose a novel neural network approach, named CoRe, with the contextual knowledge naturally incorporated and without involving external tools. Specifically, CoRe integrates two types of contextual knowledge in the training corpus, including official app descriptions from app store and responses of the retrieved semantically similar reviews, for enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the generated review responses. Experiments on practical review data show that CoRe can outperform the state-of-the-art method by 12.36% in terms of BLEU-4, an accuracy metric that is widely used to evaluate text generation systems.

AB The biodiversity crisis caused by global warming is becoming more and more serious. Thus, many species are facing the crisis of survival, and some species are even on the verge of extinction. To scientifically evaluate the impact of global warming on the distribution, management and protection of Chinese Beech, the habitat suitability of 7 Chinese Beech species was simulated based on 853 literature distribution sites and 11 environmental factors under the current, 2070 RCP2.6 and 2070 RCP8.5 climate conditions and evaluated using ArcGIS 10.2 technology and the MaxEnt model. The results showed that (1) three environmental factors, namely, Precipitation of the Driest Quarter, Minimum Temperature of the Coldest Month and Mean Diurnal Range, were the key factors that influencing the distribution of Chinese Beech; (2) the total current area of suitable habitat of Chinese Beech was about 78615.60 km(2), and only about 9527.36 km(2) was located in protected areas (12.12%); (3) with the continuous warming of the climate, the suitable habitat of Chinese Beech could lose up to 59.24%, and the protected area would be decreasing continuously. Under the best and the most extreme climate scenarios for 2070, the suitable habitat area of Chinese Beech was reduced by 33386.90 km(2) and 46573.50 km(2), respectively, and the protected area decreased by 2,362.22 km(2) and 5,056.40 km(2), respectively. (4) The highly suitable habitat was projected to move the northwest and high altitude areas. Consequently, the protection of Chinese Beech is urgently required.

AB Schizophrenia (SZ) is considered as a self-disorder with disordered local synchronous activation. Previous studies have reported widespread dyssynchrony of local activation in patients with SZ, which may be one of the crucial physiological mechanisms of SZ. To further verify this assumption, this work used a surface-based two-dimensional regional homogeneity (2dReHo) approach to compare the local neural synchronous spontaneous oscillation between patients with SZ and healthy controls (HC), instead of the volume-based regional homogeneity approach described in previous study. Ninety-seven SZ patients and 126 HC were recruited to this study, and we found the SZ showed abnormal 2dReHo across the cortical surface. Specifically, at the global level, the SZ patients showed significantly reduced global 2dReHo; at the vertex level, the foci with increased 2dReHo in SZ were located in the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and limbic network (LN); however, foci with decreased 2dReHo were located in the somatomotor network (SMN), auditory network (AN), and visual network (VN). Additionally, this work found positive correlations between the 2dReHo of bilateral rectus and illness duration, as well as a significant positive correlation between the 2dReHo of right orbital inferior frontal gyrus (OIFG) with the negative scores of the positive and negative syndrome scale in the SZ patients. Therefore, the 2dReHo could provide some effective features contributed to explore the pathophysiology mechanism of SZ.

AB Digital photography and spectrometry are widely used for colour measurement, but both methods have a number of advantages and disadvantages. Comparative studies can help determine the most appropriate method for quantifying animal colour perception, but few have attempted to compare them based on colour model conversion. Here we compare colour measurements from digital photography and spectrometry in a controlled standard experimental environment using the three-dimensional colour space model CIE L*a*b* which is designed to approximate colour perception in humans and assess the repeatability and agreement of the two methods. For digital photography, we first extracted RGB values from each colour patch and transferred these to L*a*b* values using colour model conversion. For spectrometry, we measured the spectral reflectance (SR) value and subsequently transferred SR values to L*a*b* values. Using a consensus of correlation analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients, concordance correlation coefficients, and Bland-Altman analysis, we found that although spectrometry showed a slightly higher repeatability than photography, both methods were highly repeatable and showed a strong agreement. Furthermore, we used Bland-Altman analysis to derive the limits of agreement, which can be used as criteria for identifying when photography and spectrometry could be as a suitable alternative for measuring colour perception in humans and other trichromatic species. We suggest that our workflow offers a practical and logical approach that could improve how we currently study colour perception in trichromats. Significance statement Measuring colour efficiently and accurately is necessary for investigating the evolutionary biology of colour perception in animals. Digital photography and spectrometry are two methods widely used for colour measurement, but there are benefits and limitations to using either method. Comparative studies based on colour model conversion are therefore critical for helping researchers determine which method is most appropriate. Here we test the repeatability and agreement of the two measuring methods using standard colour patches, as a comparative case study of broader interest in measuring colour perception in humans and similar primates. Our results demonstrate that both methods are highly repeatable, and the two methods may be used interchangeably to measure colour perception in humans under experimental conditions.

AB Purpose: We aimed to find the association between screen time (ST)-based sedentary behavior and depression in children and adolescents.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of science database were searched to find eligible studies until April 25, 2021. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators independently, followed by quality assessment for included studies. Odd ration (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were regarded as effect size index. Heterogeneity test was conducted using Cochran' s Q test and I-2 test. Least squares trend estimation method was used for dose-response meta-analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata12.0 software.
   Results: Totally 22 articles containing 197,673 cases were included. The pooled results displayed that there was a significant positive correlation between ST and depression [OR (95%CI) = 1.24 (1.11, 1.38), P < 0.001]. Similar results were observed for watching television (TV), computer use (CU), computer game (CG)/video game (VG) and internet use (IU)/mobile phone (MP) time. Dose-response meta-analysis showed that take 1 hour/day as control, the risk of depression went down and then went up as sedentary time increased for ST (P > 0.05). The risk of depression was significantly increased when TV time beyond 4.5 hours/day (P < 0.05), or CU time beyond 0.5 hours/day (P < 0.05), or CG/VG time beyond 2 hours/day (P < 0.05), or IU/MP time beyond 0.5 hours/day (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: ST-based sedentary behavior was associated with the risk of depression in a non-linear dose-response manner for children and adolescents.

AB Carboxyl-terminated hyper-branched polyester is extensively used as high exhaustion chrome tanning auxiliary owing to its strong coordination ability with trivalent chrome. Owing to lower electronegativity of N than O, the coordination ability with trivalent chrome for hyper-branched polyamide is stronger than polyester. Herein, in this paper, an amino-terminated hyper-branched polyamide (HBPN) is synthesized and used as high exhaustion chrome in tanning of pickling pigskin (HBPN-Cr). The effects of utilization of HBPN in denaturation temperature, shrinkage temperature, chrome uptake, and microstructure structure of wet-blue leather are studied. Moreover, the anti-oxidation stability of wet-blue leather is preliminary studied by heat treatment. The results show that incorporation of 1% HBPN in pickling process can significantly improve chrome uptake to 83.32%. The hydrothermal stability of wet-blue leather is improved due to the formation of higher crosslinking degree of collagen fibers. In addition, for the wet-blue leather without unsaturated fatliquoring agent, through heat treatment, hexavalent chrome does not appear after 24 h heat treatment. On the contrary, the chrome complex changes from hydroxyl copolymerization to more stable oxygen copolymerization or chrome oxide for C-Cr and HBPN-Cr tanned leather, respectively. These results will build a data support for the further study of hyper-branched polymer chrome tanning auxiliaries.

AB Understanding the relationships between environmental variables and erosion rates in badlands is vital for forecasting sediment yields. While the controlling role of rainfall on badland erosion rates has long been recognized, here we assess the relative influences of temperature and precipitation on slope erosion rates in the Nanxiong Basin, Southeast China. The volume of weathered and transported fragments was measured within a bounded plot at ten-day intervals between May 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017, and temperature and precipitation were continuously recorded. Mann-Kendall tau correlation, Granger causality, impulse response, and variance decomposition analyses were performed. The results show that Granger causality relationships exist between the ten-day mean temperature (TMT) and ten-day mean erosion rates (TER) and between the ten-day total precipitation (TTP) amount and the TER. Moreover, our findings indicate that TMT and TTP explained 14.6 and 12.61% of the variability in slope erosion rates, respectively, which indicates that temperature had at least the same influence on slope erosion than precipitation. In addition, because 22.5% of the measured erosion occurred during periods when there were no erosive rain events, the importance of small dry slides for removing rock fragments from these humid slopes is emphasized.

AB Cyniclomyces guttulatus is usually recognised as an inhabitant of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in rabbits. However, large numbers of C. guttulatus are often detected in the faeces of diarrhoeic rabbits. The relationship of C. guttulatus with rabbit diarrhoea needs to be clearly identified. In this study, a C. guttulatus Zhejiang strain was isolated from a New Zealand White rabbit with severe diarrhoea and then inoculated into SPF New Zealand white rabbits alone or co-inoculated with Eimeria intestinalis, another kind of pathogen in rabbits. Our results showed that the optimal culture medium pH and temperature for this yeast were pH 4.5 and 40-42 degrees C, respectively. The sequence lengths of the 18S and 26S ribosomal DNA fragments were 1559 bp and 632 bp, respectively, and showed 99.8% homology with the 18S ribosomal sequence of the NRRL Y-17561 isolate from dogs and 100% homology with the 26S ribosomal sequence of DPA-CGR1 and CGDPA-GP1 isolates from rabbits and guinea pigs, respectively. In animal experiments, the C. guttulatus Zhejiang strain was not pathogenic to healthy rabbits, even when 1 x 10(8) vegetative cells were used per rabbit. Surprisingly, rabbits inoculated with yeast showed a slightly better body weight gain and higher food intake. However, SPF rabbits co-inoculated with C. guttulatus and E. intestinalis developed more severe coccidiosis than rabbits inoculated with C. guttulatus or E. intestinalis alone. In addition, we surveyed the prevalence of C. guttulatus in rabbits and found that the positive rate was 83% in Zhejiang Province. In summary, the results indicated that C. guttulatus alone is not pathogenic to healthy rabbits, although might be an opportunistic pathogen when the digestive tract is damaged by other pathogens, such as coccidia.

AB Background: Fat metabolism is a complex process regulated by a number of factors. Adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) gene takes active part in lipid metabolism. Although, there have been some researches indicating that ADIPOR1 could influence the milk fat metabolism through targeting some factors, little is known about the effect of ADIPOR1 on goat milk fat metabolism. To investigate the regulatory role of ADIPOR1 on milk fat metabolism in GMECs, we analysed overexpression in the presence and absence of AdipoRon (50 mu M) and examined knockdown using siRNA. Using RT-qPCR, we assessed ADIPOR1 mRNA expressions among different lactation stages in goat mammary gland and the expression of six genes that regulate milk fat metabolism in GMECs.
   Results: ADIPOR1 mRNA expression level was higher during the various lactation stages, except dry-off period. Knockdown and overexpression results revealed a significant decrease and increase in mRNA expression of ADIPOR1 and genes considered: SREBF1, ACACA, FASN, SCD, ATGL, and HSL, respectively. Treatment of GMECs with AdipoRon 50 mu M resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the mRNA expression of all measured genes, except SREBF1.
   Conclusion: Overall, ADIPOR1 plays a central role in regulating the transcription of several genes involved in milk fat metabolism.

AB Herein we report solvothermal synthesis of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) decorated magnetic molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MMoS2/PAA) for highly efficient adsorption of three cationic dyes of basic fuchsin (BF), methylene blue (MB), and crystal violet (CV) from aqueous solutions. The synthesized MMoS2/PAA was characterized by several techniques including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Due to the strong electrostatic interaction between cationic dyes and the anionic nanosheet surface, the obtained MMoS2/PAA showed ultrafast adsorption of BF, MB and CV within 2 min with high adsorption capacities of 886.1, 709.0, and 633.6 mg g(-1), respectively, much higher than those materials reported recently. PAA molecules bound on the nanosheets played a crucial role in significantly enhancing the dye adsorption. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of three dyes onto the MMoS2/PAA were well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic and the Langmuir models. Moreover, the MMoS2/PAA also exhibited high removal efficiencies for various mixed-dye solutions. Besides, such a functional nanomaterial could be effectively recovered from dye solutions under an external magnetic field and reused for dye adsorption without compromising on its performance indicating it can serve as an excellent adsorbent for effective removal of a variety of cationic organic pollutants from industrial effluents.

AB In evolutionary games, the optimal strategy is derived from repeated trial and error. The strategy that has been maintained in the recent period is more likely a desirable choice. This paper proposes a mechanism for the snowdrift game on a square lattice and tries to facilitate cooperation. The new mechanism encourages individuals to choose a strategy that can meet a given aspiration level for a long time. The core of this mechanism lies in two aspects: (i) If an individual randomly selects a neighbour and obtains a return that does not meet the aspiration level, he will directly switch strategy without referring to strategies of others. (ii) When the aspiration level is met, we take the number of strategy changes in the past few rounds of every individual as a parameter, and an individual learns its selected neighbour's strategy by Fermi updating rule in case of his number of strategy changes is not smaller than his selected neighbour's. The simulation results show that the low aspiration level is conductive to the emergence of cooperative behaviour and that the novel mechanism significantly improves the level of cooperation. It is worth mentioning that the cooperation level always remains at 1 for the (1-aspiration level) part of the cost-to-benefit ratio r. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Utilization of female livestock can be optimized by application of Fixed-Time Artificial Insemination (FTAI), which plays an important role in large-scale livestock production. However, molecular mechanism of FTAI affecting reproductive performance remains unclear. To investigate the effects of FTAI on corpus luteum in 16 and 25 days of pregnancy gilts, 12 pregnancy gilts were selected from Altrenogest + PMSG + GnRH (APG) group and control group. The number of left and right CL in APG group were significantly higher than control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, result showed the number of differentially expressed genes between 16APG group and 16 C group was obviously larger than that between 25APG and 25 C group (2394 vs. 1476). Up regulated genes in APG were mainly associated with cytokine production and secretion, cell communication and transport (day 16) and angiogenesis, cell cycle and cell-cell signaling (day 25). The expression of differentially expressed genes (RPL10, CYP17A1, DCN, IL18, LDLR and PRLR) in luteal tissue were verified by real-time PCR. In summary, APG program significantly improve reproductive efficiency of gilts through up regulation of cytokine production/secretion, cell communication and transport in Day 16 pregnancy and angiogenesis, cell cycle and cell-cell signaling at Day 25 pregnancy in porcine.

AB Canine norovirus (CNV) is a diarrhea-causing pathogen in canines. In this study, 268 canine diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 13 pet hospitals across three provinces in China between March 2017 and May 2019, and 7.8% (21/268) samples were detected as CNV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of twentyone CNV RdRp fragments showed that eighteen of the strains clustered in GVI.2, two clustered in GVI.1 and one clustered in GIV.2. The complete RdRp, VP1, and VP2 genes of four GVI.2 strains obtained from three provinces were successfully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses based on the RdRp, VP1, and VP2 genes showed that the GVI.2 strains from this study were closely related to USA GVI.2 strains. The complete genome of GVI.2 strain Dog/M9/18/CH was successfully sequenced, it was 7905 nucleotides (nt) in length and shared 95.9% nt identity with the sole available, nearly full-length genome of GVI.2 strain genome. To our knowledge, this is first description of the molecular prevalence of CNV in mainland China, and the first report of a complete GVI.2 genome. These findings will extend our understanding of epidemics and the genetic evolution of CNV.

TI Directional charge transportation and Rayleigh scattering for the

ID NANOPARTICLES; TIO2
AB In this work, we propose a novel technique based on wavelength dispersive in situ fluorescence spectroscopy (WDIFS) for diagnosing the wavelength-dependent directional charge transportation and Rayleigh scattering enhanced in-band quantum yield. For the first time, it is clearly demonstrated that the formation of the 2D electron gas in CuO/ZnO and upward Schottky barriers in ZnO/Ag facilitate the photocatalytic performance in the ultraviolet spectral range, and that utilization of the visible spectrum relies on the band alignment between the energy level of the dopants and the Fermi level of Ag. Moreover, it is shown that the wavelength-dependent in-band quantum yield can be controlled through particle size photon scattering, in which the strong Rayleigh scattering based photon harvesting brings about a significant increase in the photocatalytic performance in the ultraviolet spectrum. Eventually, it is forecast that systematic use of the proposed technique for a systematic diagnosis should help towards the production of efficient ZnO-based photocatalysts.

AB The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is an elusive high-altitude specialist and under substantial threat throughout its range. To characterize microsatellites (SSRs) for the snow leopard, we performed genome-mining and comparison of SSRs with 1-6 bp nucleotide motifs between the snow leopard and all other Panthera species. A total of 1,323,721 perfect SSRs were mined for the snow leopard, which is lower than the lion (1,346,471), leopard (1,527,334), and jaguar (1,508,527) but higher than the tiger (1,236,361). Mono-nucleotide SSRs were the most frequent perfect SSRs while hexa-nucleotide SSRs the least. The GC content was the highest in tri-nucleotide SSRs while the lowest in the mono-nucleotide SSRs. Location analysis revealed that microsatellites were predominantly concentrated at both ends of genes. Most genes containing microsatellite had the SSR present at only one locus, from which we infer that the number of SSRs per gene is limited even though intragenic tandem repeats can generate functional variability. Functional analysis of genes whose coding regions have SSRs identified items involved in metabolic process and immune system, which was possibly associated with high-altitude adaptation. SSR analysis can help to develop functional markers and facilitate further analysis of microsatellite function in the snow leopard. Our data and findings will be useful for understanding the frequency and the distribution of SSRs in the snow leopard genome and provide valuable resources for further development and identification of snow leopard SSRs, which facilitates the long-term conservation and genetic diversity for this endangered species.

AB The effects of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and graphene oxide (GO) on the curing of glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) were investigated. The rheological parameters of GAP crosslinked by bispropargyl succinate (BPS) were investigated by rheometry instrument. The curing kinetics by the differential isoconversional method revealed that AP (1 wt%) increased the apparent activation energy from 72.98 to 76.41 kJ mol(-1). However, the presence of GO (0.1 wt%) catalyzed the curing of GAP/triazole by decreasing the apparent activation energy to 62.86 kJ mol(-1). The physical models revealed that the addition of GO changed the cure mechanism of GAP/BPS as it acted as new nucleation sites. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) results also showed that chemical groups on the surface of GO reacted with the hydroxyl groups of GAP, which changed the curing mechanism of GAP/BPS and improved the tension strength of the propellant by 104%.

AB Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) is a polyfunctional cytokine with important roles in growth, differentiation and immune function in various animals. In this study, PCR, bioinformatics, real-time quantitative PCR, prokaryotic expression, protein purification and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS) were applied to investigate the structural features and function of TGF beta 1-b in crucian carp. The complete coding sequence (CDS) of TGF beta 1-b was 1134 bp in length and was submitted to GenBank (ID: MH473141). TGF beta 1-b encoded a putative protein of 377 amino acids and included a signal peptide consisting of 22 amino acids. TGF beta 1-b was relatively conservative in fish and distant from mammals in terms of evolutionary relationship. TGF beta 1-b was found to be expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. The expressions of TGF beta 1-b in muscle, heart and liver were increased with the addition of Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium at 30 days (p < 0.01). While, the expressions of SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD7 were also up-regulated with the addition of R. palustris at 20 days (p < 0.01). The expression of TGF beta 1-b could be affected by time and group factors (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression vector TGF beta 1-b-pDE2 was successfully constructed. Prokaryotic expression indicated that a 43 kDa target protein was obtained after induction with 1.5 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3.5 h at 37 degrees C for 200 r/h. The activities of alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme in injection TGF beta 1-b protein group (ITg) and feeding broken bacterial liquid group (BTg) were significantly increased at 24 h (p < 0.01). And the activities of superoxide dismutase in ITg were significantly increased at 36 h (p < 0.01). Besides, the expressions of heat shock protein 30 and heat shock protein 47 in ITg and BTg were significantly increased (p < 0.01). Whereas, the expression of interleukin-11 was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). These results indicated that TGF beta 1-b protein might play a role in immunity of crucian carp. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, the robust stabilization issues on uncertain system with H-infinity performance are investigated by applying impulsive time related control algorithm. A hybrid control scheme is novelly proposed using proportional impulsive plus integral mechanism. This impulse-time-dependent (ITD) feedback controller employs the proportional control action Kp at impulse instants for stabilizing. Then, intermittently the integral control strategy K-I(t) is implemented between impulsive time intervals for improving the state convergence. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the closed-loop performance. In addition, a memory controller K-D is introduced to tackle the stabilization problem of system with signal transmission delay. Furthermore, a distributed time-varying delay delta(k)(t) is defined in the impulsive control-based system. Considering discrete and distributed time-varying delays concurrently, the ITD stability criteria are deduced to guarantee the H-infinity performance on uncertain system with exogenous disturbance. Numerical examples are conducted to show the expected stabilization and state convergence response with disturbance attenuation of this development.

AB Myogenesis includes sequential stages of progenitor cell proliferation, myogenic commitment and differentiation, myocyte fusion, and myotube maturation. Different stages of myogenesis are orchestrated and regulated by myogenic regulatory factors and various downstream cellular signaling. Here we identify phosphatase orphan 1 (Phospho1) as a new player in myogenesis. During activation, proliferation, and differentiation of quiescent satellite cells, the expression of Phospho1 gradually increases. Overexpression of Phospho1 inhibits myoblast proliferation but promotes their differentiation and fusion. Conversely, knockdown of Phospho1 accelerates myoblast proliferation but impairs myotube formation. Moreover, knockdown of Phospho1 decreases the OXPHO protein levels and mitochondria density, whereas overexpression of Phospho1 upregulates OXPHO protein levels and promotes mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Finally, we show that Phospho1 expression is controlled by myogenin, which binds to the promoter of Phospho1 to regulate its transcription. These results indicate a key role of Phospho1 in regulating myogenic differentiation and mitochondrial function.

AB This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary energy on antioxidant capacity, liver glucose-lipid-related gene expressions and meat fatty acid of Holstein bulls. Thirty-six Holstein bulls (age, 17.0 +/- 0.49 months; body weight, 493.3 +/- 39.7 kg) were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments. The metabolizable energy of diets was 10.12, 10.90 and 11.68 MJ/kg. Bulls in each dietary treatment were sampled at the age of 20, 23 or 26 months. Results showed that serum glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase decreased with the increasing age. Dietary energy and age had interaction effects on the expressions of fatty acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, acyl coenzyme A oxidase 1 and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1 alpha. Besides, the increase of age and dietary energy increased the expression of liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1. The expressions of liver glucose-6-phosphatase, tumour necrosis factor alpha and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 increased with the increasing age. The increase of age and dietary energy increased the proportions of C18:1cis-9, C18:2n-6transand monounsaturated fatty acid. In summary, the increase of age and dietary energy enhanced the intensity of metabolic changes and inflammatory responses. Dietary energy and age affected the expressions of liver lipid metabolism-related genes, further affected meat fatty acid composition of Holstein bulls.

AB Background Coronaviruses are notorious pathogens that cause diarrheic and respiratory diseases in humans and animals. Although the epidemiology and pathogenicity of coronaviruses have gained substantial attention, little is known about bovine coronavirus in cattle, which possesses a close relationship with human coronavirus. Bovine torovirus (BToV) is a newly identified relevant pathogen associated with cattle diarrhoea and respiratory diseases, and its epidemiology in the Chinese cattle industry remains unknown. Results In this study, a total of 461 diarrhoeic faecal samples were collected from 38 different farms in three intensive cattle farming regions and analysed. Our results demonstrated that BToV is present in China, with a low prevalence rate of 1.74% (8/461). The full-length spike genes were further cloned from eight clinical samples (five farms in Henan Province). Phylogenetic analysis showed that two different subclades of BToV strains are circulating in China. Meanwhile, the three BToV strains identified from dairy calves, 18,307, 2YY and 5YY, all contained the amino acid variants R614Q, I801T, N841S and Q885E. Conclusions This is the first report to confirm the presence of BToV in beef and dairy calves in China with diarrhea, which extend our understanding of the epidemiology of BToVs worldwide.

AB The Blue-fronted Redstart Phoenicurus frontalis (Muscicapidae) belongs to the family Muscicapidae, distributed in central China, Qinghai-Tibet plateau and the Himalayas. The conservation status of this species is Least Concern (LC) in IUCN. In this study, the complete mitogenome of P. frontalis was determined. The mitogenome is a circular molecule of 16,776 bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosome RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and 1 non-coding region. We reconstructed a phylogenetic tree based on Bayesian inference for 15 Passeriformes species. The new mitogenome data would provide useful information for application in conservation genetics and further clarify the phylogenetic evolution of this species.

AB Obesity has developed into a considerable health problem in the whole world. Escherichia coli (E. coli) can cause nosocomial pneumonia and induce cell apoptosis during injury and infection. Normal (lean) and diet-induced obesity mice (DIO, fed with high-fat diet) were chosen to perform nasal instillation with E. coli to establish a nonfatal acute pneumonia model. At 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h postinfection, lung tissues were obtained to measure cell apoptosis. As shown in this study, both lean and DIO mice exhibited histopathological lesions of acute pneumonia and increased cell apoptosis in the lung infected with E. coli. Interestingly, the relative mRNA and protein expressions associated with either endoplasmic reticulum stress or death receptor apoptotic pathway were all dramatically increased in the DIO mice after infection, while only significant upregulation of death receptor apoptotic pathway in the lean mice at 72 h. These results indicated that the DIO mice executed excess cell apoptosis in the nonfatal acute pneumonia induced by E. coli infection through endoplasmic reticulum stress and death receptor apoptotic pathway.

AB A new strategy for the hapten design of natural glycoside and application for the preparation of antibody is reported in this work. With astragaloside IV (AGS-IV) as an example, C6 ''-CH2OH on a glucosyl group was selectively oxidized by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation to C6 ''-COOH, which was subsequently condensed with -NH2 on bovine serum albumin to get artificial antigen. Then, the successful preparation of artificial antigen was verified by TCL, SDS-PAGE, UV, and MALDI-TOF-MS. Finally, rabbits were immunized with artificial antigen to obtain an antibody against AGS-IV. After tests of the titer, IC50, and crossreactivity, the results showed that the antibody prepared by TEMPO oxidation in this work had higher specificity than that the antibody prepared by conventional sodium periodate (NaIO4) oxidation. The hapten, as a carboxylic acid derivative of AGS-IV, has better water solubility than AGS IV, which is more suitable for the synthesis of the hapten-carrier protein conjugate in aqueous phase, achieving another virtue of TEMPO oxidation over NaIO4 oxidation. This new strategy provides new ideas for the design of haptens of other natural glycosides, as well as the preparation of their antibodies.

AB This paper investigates the general decay stability on systems represented by stochastic functional differential equations with semi-Markovian switching and Levy noise (SFDEs-sMS-LN). Based on generalized multidimensional Ito's formula and multiple Lyapunov functions, a new pth moment stability criterion with general decay rate is established. Meanwhile, as an applications of the presented stability criterion, we consider the stabilization problem of stochastic delayed neural networks with semi-Markovian switching and Levy noise (SDNN-sMS-LN). A vertex approach is proposed to design the controller in terms of binary diagonal matrices (BDMs) and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB The aim of this study was to clone KLF6 gene of Tibetan chicken, clarify its temporal-spatial expression characteristics, and build the correlation between the expression level of KLF6 gene and IMF content in different developmental stages. RT-PCR was used to clone Tibetan chicken KLF6 gene, qPCR was used to detect the expression level of KLF6 gene in different tissues and developmental stages. The sequence of KLF6 gene was 919 bp including a complete 852 bp CDS region. The gene was highest expression in lung tissues, which was significantly higher than in other tissues (p < 0.01). In male Tibetan chicken breast muscle the levels of KLF6 mRNA were negatively related to IMF content (r=-0.097, p > 0.05), while in females they were positively correlated (r = 0.077, p > 0.05). At the age of 119-210 days, the expression of KLF6 mRNA in the male chicken leg muscles was highly positively correlated (r = 0.506, p < 0.01), but negatively correlated in the female chicken leg muscles (r=-0.198, p > 0.05). The expression level of KLF6 in breast muscle decreased gradually with the increasing age, while in leg muscle the expression level increased firstly and then descended with the increasing age.

TI Resource-partitioned spectrum assignment to realize efficient
   multicasting for flexible grid optical networks
SO OPTICAL FIBER TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BANDWIDTH DEFRAGMENTATION; ALLOCATION; SCHEME
AB With the increasing demand of some novel point-to-multi-point services, such as live video delivering and interactive distance learning, efficient multicasting is highly desirable in flexible grid optical networks (FGONs). Thus, many sophisticated multicast-enabled routing and resource allocation algorithms have been proposed to realize efficient multicasting in FGONs. These algorithms, known as multicast routing and spectrum assignment (MRSA) algorithms, optimized the light-trees and the allocated spectrum resources for multicast services in FGONs. But, most of them ignored some small-sized, isolated, and un-occupied spectrum bands, which are remained after multicast services being accommodated. Due to the continuity and the contiguity constraints in service accommodation, these remained spectrum bands can hardly be allocated to subsequent multicast services and are thus known as spectrum fragments. Their existence and accumulation may exhaust available spectral resources and affect the networking performance (e.g. service blocking performance) for the multicast traffic in FGONs. In this way, the efficiency of FGONs in supporting multicast traffic may be greatly deteriorated. Therefore, the spectrum fragments generated in accommodating multicast services has become an important issue in FGONs. In this paper, we propose a resource-partitioned interval-maximized (RPIM) MRSA algorithm to restrain the generation of spectrum fragments for the multicast traffic in FGONs. The proposed RPIM MRSA algorithm does not utilize the metric, "cut", to reduce spectrum fragments via avoiding splitting the whole spectrum band into too many band pieces as in fragmentation-aware MRSA algorithms. Instead, the proposed RPIM MRSA algorithm partitions the spectrum resources on each sought light-tree into several elastic groups according to the types of multicast services, and maximizes the group interval between two adjacent groups on the sought light-trees. Since the spectrum resources in each group can always be utilized by the multicast services of the same type, the proposed algorithm restricts the generation of spectrum fragments in group intervals. In this way, the proposed RPIM MRSA algorithm can remarkably reduce spectrum fragments generated in accommodating multicast services. Note that, different from previous group-based algorithms, the proposed RPIM algorithm allows one elastic group for the multicast services of a certain type to contain different amount of spectrum resources on different light-trees. This helps guarantee the flexibility in constructing elastic groups on diverse light-trees. Additionally, the proposed RPIM MRSA algorithm maximizes the group intervals on the sought light-trees, which helps reserve more vacant spectrum resources between two adjacent groups on the light-trees. Since these vacant spectrum resources can be merged into their adjacent groups if needed, the proposed algorithm can reduce not only the spectrum fragments generated in group intervals but also the blocked multicast services in groups by maximizing group intervals on the light-trees. Simulation results verify that the proposed RPIM algorithm can realize efficient multicasting with significantly reduced spectrum fragments and low service blocking probability in FGONs.

ID NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS; NOMA
AB Recent signal processing of optical signals has involved possible overlapping of the spectra from the adjacent optical channels for channel multiplexing and improving system throughput. However, the incurred channel interference performance has not yet been carefully characterized. In this paper, we carry out simulations and experiments to investigate various system parameters that determine such adjacent channel interference performance and further optimize the channel power ratio when two optical channels, each carrying a Nyquist shaped and polarization multiplexed quadrature phase-shift keying (Nyquist-PM-QPSK) signal, are being multiplexed with optical spectral overlap. With a properly designed successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm, both channels can be successfully separated and decoded individually. The OSNR penalties due to possible time offset, polarization rotation, and frequency offset between the two adjacent optical channels are investigated. The power ratio between the two adjacent optical channels are further optimized with respect to the OSNR penalties.

Moreover, a non-fragile state feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is robustly stochastically passive.

AB Rapid and efficient demulsification (destabilizing of an emulsion) processes of a water in oil (W/O) emulsion were carried out in a three-dimensional electric spiral plate-type microchannel (3D-ESPM). In this experiment, the demulsifying efficiency of emulsions by 3D-ESPM was compared with that by gravity settling, the factors influencing demulsifying efficiency were investigated, and the induction period, cut size and residence time in the demulsification process were studied. The results showed that in contrast to the gravity settling method, 3D-ESPM can directly separate the disperse phase (water) instead of the continuous phase (oil). The maximum demulsifying efficiency of W/O emulsion in a single pass through the 3D-ESPM reached 90.3%, with a microchannel height of 200 mu m, electric field intensity of 250 V /cm, microchannel angle of 180 degrees, microchannel with 18 plates and a flow rate of 2 mL /min. An induction period of 0.6 s during the demulsification process was simulated with experimental data fitting. When the residence time of emulsion in 3D-ESPM was longer than the induction period, its demulsifying efficiency increased as the increase of the flow velocity due to the droplet coalescence effects of Dean vortices in the spiral microchannel. For this device a cut size of droplets of 4.5 mu m was deduced. Our results showed that the demulsification process of W/O emulsion was intensified by 3D-ESPM based on the coupling effect between electric field-induced droplets migration and microfluidic hydrodynamic trapping.

AB The yak, Bos grunniens, is the only large mammal in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and has been bred to provide meat, milk, and transportation. Previous studies indicate that the immune system contributes to the yak's adaptation to high-altitude environments. In order to further investigate changes in immune function during yak development, we compared the transcriptome profiles of gluteus and lung tissues among yaks at 6, 30, 60, and 90 months of age. Analyses of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung tissues revealed that immune function was more activated at 6-months and less activated at 90-months than in the 30 and 60-month-old animals. DEG exploration in gluteal tissues revealed that immune functions were more highly activated at both 6 and 90-months, compared with 30 and 60-months. Immune system activation in the muscle and lung tissues of 30-month-old yaks may increase their resistance to infections, while decreased may be due to aging. Furthermore, the higher immune activation status in the gluteal tissues in 90-month-old yaks could be due to muscle injury and subsequent regeneration, which is supported by the fact that 5 unigenes related with muscle injury and 3 related to muscle regeneration displayed greater expression levels at 90-months than at 30 and 60-months. Overall, the present study highlights the important role of the immune system in yak development, which will facilitate future investigations.

AB Photoluminescence intermittency in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has limited their applications in single QD process. Understanding the origin of intermittency and its correlation with microstructure is crucial for the design and preparation of QDs with high fluorescence quantum yield. The small-sized (CdSe)(3) and (CdSe)(4) clusters provide a typical model for studying the effect of size, structure, surface defect, etc., on the radiative and nonradiative rates of II-VI QDs. The rate constants of radiative and nonradiative processes, k(r) and k(nr), are computed for the model systems using first-principles calculations, Marcus theory, and Fermi's golden rule. Although k(r) and k(nr) vary in a complicated way from cluster to cluster, their correlation with the geometrical and electronic properties of ground- and excited-state structures are revealed. Structure distortion in excitation, spatial overlap between the Kohn-Sham orbitals occupied by excited electron, reorganization energy, Huang-Rhys factor of dominant vibrational modes, as well as the unsaturation of surface atoms exert influences on k(r) and k(nr). Moreover, these quantities correlate with each other and their roles may change in the radiative/nonradiative process. While some quantities, such as reorganization energy and atomic unsaturation, have been used solely to estimate the photoluminescence yield, a combination of these factors is suggested to give reliable predictions. In addition, our calculations indicate that k(r) and k(nr) can be tuned by designing the QDs with specific geometrical and electronic structures. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

AB In this work, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) function as a detector and another dimension of separation was coupled with CE to achieve two-dimensional separation. To improve the performance of hyphenated CE-IMS instrument, electrospray ionization correlation ion mobility spectrometry is evaluated and compared with traditional signal averaging data acquisition method using tetraalkylammonium bromide compounds. The effect of various parameters on the separation including sample introduction, sheath fluid of CE and drift gas, data acquisition method of IMS were investigated. The experimental result shows that the optimal conditions are as follows: hydrodynamic sample injection method, the electrophoresis voltage is 10 kilo volts, 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate buffer solution containing 80% acetonitrile as both the background electrolyte and the electrospray ionization sheath fluid, the ESI liquid flow rate is 4.5 mu L/min, the drift voltage is 10.5 kilo volts, the drift gas temperature is 383 K and the drift gas flow rate is 300 mL/min. Under the above conditions, the mixture standards of seven tetraalkylammoniums can be completely separated within 10 min both by CE and IMS. The linear range was 5-250 mu g/mL, with LOD of 0.152, 0.204, 0.277, 0.382, 0.466, 0.623 and 0.892 mu g/mL, respectively. Compared with traditional capillary electrophoresis detection methods, the developed CE-ESI-IMS method not only provide two sets of qualitative parameters including electrophoresis migration time and ion drift time, ion mobility spectrometer can also provide an additional dimension of separation and could apply to the detection ultra-violet transparent compounds or none fluorescent compounds.

AB Functional reprogramming of a differentiated cell toward pluripotent cell may have long-term applications in numerous aspects, especially in regenerative medicine. Evidences accumulating from recent studies suggest that cellular extracts from stem cells or pluripotent cells can induce epigenetic reprogramming and facilitate pluripotency in otherwise highly differentiated cell types. Epigenetic reprogramming using cellular extracts has gained increasing attention and applied to recognize the functional factors, acquire the target cell types, and explain the mechanism of reprogramming. Now, more and more researches have proved that cellular extract treatment is an important strategy of cellular reprogramming. Thus, this review mainly focused on the progresses and potential mechanisms in epigenetic reprogramming using cellular extracts.

AB In order to improve the life cycle of wireless sensor networks as well as reducing the energy cost, the structural optimization and energy conservation for region segmentation are designed. A region segmentation model for wireless sensor networks based on optimal energy conservation constraints is proposed. The initial network topology for node distribution of wireless sensor networks is constructed. The equivalent network-wide energy balance topology is used for optimal calculation of the coverage area of the sensor network and the shortest path optimization method is used for energy conservation design for sensor network nodes. According to the energy attribute of sensor nodes, the coverage area of wireless sensor networks is segmented optimally to improve the coverage of wireless sensor networks and reduce the energy cost of a single node in the network, to realize the optimal networking of wireless sensor networks. The simulation results show that for the region segmentation model of wireless sensor networks constructed by this method, the quality reliability of transmitting data by network nodes is higher, the regional coverage is stronger and the energy cost is lower, compared with previous works, which effectively prolong the life cycle of wireless sensor networks.

AB In this study, we determined almost all of the genome sequence of minute virus of canines (MVC) strain CDK47/2017 and performed phylogenetic analysis with this isolate and other MVC isolates. The genome of CDK47/2017 has the following characteristics: 1) The amino acid sequence of the NS1 protein is similar to that of the novel strain 15D009/KT241026.1, which has 17 identical amino acid changes and two identical amino acid insertions compared with other known MVC strains. These two strains clustered in a unique branch in an NSI-based phylogenetic tree. 2) Phylogenetic analysis based on the NP1 protein showed that strain CDK47/2017clustered in an independent branch with strains 15D009/KT241026.1 and HM-6/AB158475.1, both of which has 10 identical amino acid changes compared with other known MVC strains. 3) Eight unique amino acid substitutions of the CDK47/2017 capsid protein resulted in it forming a unique branch in the phylogenetic tree. 4) Recombination events were identified between the 3 end of the NS1 gene and 5 end of NP1 gene. Together, these characteristics suggest that strain CDK47/2017 represents a novel MVC strain that is distinct from all known MVC strains with sequences in the GenBank database. This contributes to a greater understanding of the genetic evolution of MVC.

ID GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
AB Multi-modal optimization is a troublesome problem faced by optimization algorithms. The multiscale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) utilizes group statistics strategy to evaluate the state of the population and neglects the individual state. It will lead the particles to be trapped in local optima when addressing multi-modal optimization problems. This paper proposes a modified MQHOA by introducing strict metastability constraints strategy (MQHOA-SMC). The new strategy adopts a joint constraint mechanism to make the particle states mutual constraint with each other. The modified algorithm enhances the ability to find a better quality solution in local areas. To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out with SPSO2011, ABC, and QPSO on classical benchmark functions and with the newly CEC2013 test suite, respectively. The computational results demonstrate that MQHOA-SMC is a competitive algorithm for multi-modal problems.

ID INSPIRED EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
AB The multiscale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) is inspired by the physical meaning of quantum wavefunction. Particles have no efficient interaction and share a wavefunction during the evolution process. In this paper, a multi-harmonic oscillator strategy is introduced, which employs multiple wavefunctions to generate new particles. The external population information can be utilized in the process of evolution. The proposed method enhances the cooperation and interaction for particles by a local collaborative operation. Moreover, an adaptive weight operator is employed in the proposed algorithm, which makes a fine-tune of solutions to keep the diversity of particles. The proposed algorithm is verified on standard benchmark functions. Wilcoxon rank sum test is adopted to ascertain the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The experiments have been conducted with several renowned heuristic algorithms. The numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms for numerical optimization.

AB From the perspective of organizational ambidexterity, we consider the choice of innovation strategy among R&D firms. By building on contractual arrangements and employing a dynamic game model, we focus on the incentive mechanism of R&D Firms' collaborative innovation and analyze incentive contracts of benefits distribution and cost-sharing when two firms conduct market-driven innovation (exploitative innovation) strategy and technological research-driven innovation (exploratory innovation) strategy respectively, and collaborate for innovation with each other. We also discuss the influence of exploratory and exploitative innovation effects on decision-making of R&D firms regarding whether to choose collaborative innovation under different incentive contracts. The results show that the effects of exploratory innovation acts as the intrinsic motivation of collaborative innovation while exploratory innovation could be improved to some degree by exploitative innovation. In addition, both investment levels of exploratory and exploitative innovation would decrease (increase) when innovation cost (innovative efficiency) increases. Moreover, compared with a benefit-distribution contract, cost-sharing contracts would not only lead exploitative innovation to realize optimal revenue, but also provide incentives for exploratory innovation more effectively.

AB We conducted this systematic review to fully investigate the fatigue of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in cancer patients. The approved and clinical used EGFR-TKIs were selected for the present meta-analysis. The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published till July 2017. Eighteen randomized controlled trials and 14088 patients were included. The current analysis suggested that the use of EGFR-TKIs increased the risk of all-grade fatigue (1.26(sic)95%CI, 1.17-1.36(sic)p < 0.00001) and high-grade (>= grade 3) fatigue (1.47(sic)95%CI, 1.22-1.78(sic)p < 0.0001). On subgroup analysis, the RR of high-grade fatigue varies significantly according to drug type, cancer type, treatment line, and treatment duration. The available data suggested that the use of EGFR-TKIs is associated with a significantly increased risk of fatigue in cancer patients.

AB The Dzo, a hybrid between the domestic Yak and cattle found on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are commercially important owing to increased meat and milk production, as well as their adaptation to extremely high-altitude environments. To better understand the genomic architecture and adaptive capabilities of this unique domesticated hybrid, we performed whole genome resequencing and compared the genomic architecture and variation of the Dzo to its progenitors: the cattle and Yak. In total, 33.17 M single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected between the Dzo and cattle reference genomes. Even though the Dzo is known to be sterile, no genetic signatures associated with sterility were found on the Dzo Y chromosome. On the contrary, our results suggest that the autosomal DMC1 locus (Chromosome 5. 110729098. C>CT) plays a role in the sterility of Dzo, which warrants further exploration of its functions. We integrated the whole genome resequencing data of cattle and Yak to obtain candidate genes with a high degree of variation that might be associated with altitudinal adaptation. We found that the EPAS1 gene, which encodes hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha, exhibited significant variation (Chromosome 11.28664187 C>T) between Yak and cattle, and may play a key role in the genetic basis of altitudinal adaptation. In addition, in analyzing differences between the Dzo, Yak, and cattle genomes, we uncovered several additional genomic signatures relevant to high altitude adaptation and meat and milk production. These findings underscore the need for further studies to improve ruminant stock for sustainable agriculture on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau..

AB During mammalian pre-implantation embryonic development, dramatic and orchestrated changes occur in gene transcription. Pregnancy rates were low when yak females were crossbred with cattle breeds, but few studies exist to describe the unique molecular network regulation behind the preimplantation development of these embryos. We determined the transcriptomes of crossbred embryos derived from yak oocytes in vitro fertilized with Jersey sperm using Illumina RNA-seq for the first time in this study. Embryos were sampled at the 2-, 4-, and 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages. The results showed that in total, 291.9 million short reads were generated from the five libraries of 2-, 4-, and 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages, with 276.2 million high-quality reads selected for further analysis. Eighty to 91% of the clean reads were aligned against the yak reference genome. A total of 19,072 transcripts were identified in five libraries, of which 7,785 transcripts were co-expressed in each stage and 2,013 transcripts were stage-specific. When a vertical bar log(2) ratio vertical bar >= 1 and q-value <= 0.05 were set as thresholds for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we detected a total of 3,690 to 10,298 DEGs between any two consecutive stages. Based on the results of GO and KEGG enrichment, some of these DEGs potentially play an important role in regulating pre-implantation development, but they are most likely stage-specific. There were 2,960, 7,287, 6,420, 7,724 and 10,417 DEGs in 2-, 4-, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages between the crossbred embryos and purebred embryos of the yak, respectively, leading to a large difference in GO terms and pathways. In conclusion, we sequenced transcriptomes of in vitro-produced crossbred embryos of yak and cattle during pre-implantation and provided comprehensive examinations of gene activities. These will be helpful for development of assisted reproductive technology and better understanding the early maternal-fetal or maternal-embryonic dialog in inter-species crossbreeding.

AB Olivine-structured LiFePO4/C composites with high rate-performance were synthesized via an industrial spray-drying technique using a low cost Fe3O4 as iron source. The as-obtained LiFePO4/C exhibits a unique bowl-like morphology with a particle size of 2-5 mu m in diameter. A continuous uniform carbon coating layer on the surface of LiFePO4/C cathodes promotes fast electron transport, whilst it guarantees the favorable electrochemical reaction. Especially the formation of porous structure leads to an average pore volume of 0.127 cm(3) g(-1) and a high specific surface area of 34.46 m(2) g(-1), which is conducive to facilitating the penetration of electrolyte and providing the more contact area of electrolyte with LiFePO4/C. As a result, the as-prepared LiFePO4/C cathode material delivers an outstanding discharge capacity of 102.1 mAh g(-1), 94.2% of the initial capacity (108.3 mAh g(-1)), after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Even at an ultrahigh current rate of 50 C, it still shows an initial discharge capacity of 58 mAh g(-1).

AB 2 bola-type collagen hydrolysate-based siloxane surfactants (CBES) were prepared via grafting of an epoxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane oligomer onto 2 collagen hydrolysates with different molecular weights. Their structure was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy, and the degree of grafting was determined by calculating the free amino content, which confirmed the successful synthesis of CBES. Subsequently, their physicochemical properties, such as particle size and isoelectric point, were evaluated. Besides, surface activities, application functionalities, and biodegradability of CBES were investigated. The results showed that CBES-1, prepared with the lower-molecular-weight collagen hydrolysate, possessed superior surface activity, excellent foaming ability, and good emulsifying capacity comparable to those of a typical emulsifier such as the fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO-9). In addition, their BOD5/CODCr value and CO2 evolution demonstrated that the CBES are readily biodegradable. There is, therefore, great potential for the bola-type CBES to be applied in fields such as leather treatment and textile industries.

ID PLACE
AB Among the 262 resource-based cities defined for the first time by the State Council of China in 2013, there are 67 cities showing the tendency of drying up due to natural resources. These cities with lagging economy, serious livelihood issue and ecological environment pressure have become the key and difficult areas to accelerate the transformation of economic development mode. The transformation and development of Panzhihua, Sichuan Province, China was selected in this study as a case to deeply discuss the climate resource endowment, urban transformation and development and the culture-economy-eco geography chain remolding. The experience of Panzhihua to successfully explore the green transformation and development of resource-exhausted city can be summarized as an inflow of "migratory-style residents" through the planning of cultural leisure tourism; the transformation of economic growth mode can be realized through the development of urban green transformation; at the same time of the transformation of economic growth mode, the chain remolding reaction of cultural geography-economic geography-eco geography can be achieved to realize the sustainable improvement of ecological environment. The experience of Panzhihua to explore the green transformation of resource-exhausted city not only provides the practical reference for the urban transformation and development of resource-exhausted city with the combination of new economic geography theory and Chinese characteristics, but also helps to enrich the connotation of theory and expand the space for the application of theory.

AB BACKGROUND: Assessment of physical fitness is a common and effective method for evaluating the health status of teenage students.
   OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to assess physical fitness in adolescents residing in Shanghai, and investigate the relationships among anthropometry, muscle fitness, and a 20-meter shuttle run test (20-m SRT).
   METHODS: A total of 449 middle school students (12-17 years old, 246 boys and 203 girls) from four different regions of Shanghai, China were included as study participants.
   RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analyses indicate that upper extremity muscle strength and standing vertical jump were positively related to age and weight, while negatively related to gender, scapular skinfold, and calf skinfold. Strong positive correlations were also demonstrated between the number of laps accomplished on the 20-m SRT and upper extremity muscle strength as well as standing vertical jump height.
   CONCLUSION: Muscle strength is an important anthropometric characteristic that may be used for the assessment of sprinting ability in adolescents.

AB At the onset of lactation, there are three distinct stages of mammary tissue development and function including mammogenesis, colostrogenesis, and lactogenesis. The mechanism of the transition from colostrogenesis to lactogenesis of Maiwa Yak is still unknown. In this study, mammary tissues from three Maiwa Yaks were collected at 1 and 30 d after parturition for transcriptome exploration using Affymetrix Bovine Genome Arrays. Comparing 1 and 30 d results, a total of 517 annotated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at the criteria of a P <= 0.05. The ratio of up-regulated genes to the down-regulated ones was around 1: 2 (more specifically, 164: 353). To depict the profile of DEGs, a dynamic impact approach (DIA) was used to analyse the microarray data based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. GO terms "fatty acid transport" and "monocarboxylic acid transport" were significantly induced during the colostrum period. The strongly impacted KEGG pathways were "chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis", "glycosphingolipid biosynthesis", and "glycerolipid metabolism". These data may provide candidate genes with a high probability of having functional roles in regulating the transition from colostrum to normal milk in domestic yak mammary gland.

In this work, we presented the evolutions of their phase structure and electrical properties by tailoring the compositions in KNN-based ceramics. By considering the XRD and epsilon (r)-T curves, a rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase structure is identified in the composition region of 0.04 ae x < 0.05, 0.005 ae y ae 0.006 and 0.40 < z < 0.55, and the enhanced electrical properties (e.g., d (33)similar to 405 pC/N, k (p)similar to 0.485, T (C)similar to 321 A degrees C, strain similar to 0.16% and d (33)*similar to 515 pm/V) was obtained in the ceramics of x = 0.04, y = 0.006, z = 0.50. Moreover, a good thermal stability was also observed in the ceramics. Therefore, such a research can benefit the sustainable development of KNN-based for the practical piezoelectric devices.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can coordinate the main pathways involved in innate and adaptive immune responses by regulating gene expression. To explore the resistance to mastitis in cows, miR-144-5p and miR-130b-5p were identified in bovine mammary gland tissue and 14 potential target genes belonging to the chemokine signaling pathway, the arginine and proline metabolism pathway and the mRNA surveillance pathway were predicted. Subsequently, we estimated the relative expression of miR-144-5p and miR-130b-5p in cow mammary tissues by using stem-loop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that the relative expression of miR-144-5p and miR-130b-5p in the mastitis-infected mammary tissues (n = 5) was significantly downregulated 0.14-fold (p < 0.01) and upregulated 3.34-fold (p < 0.01), respectively, compared to healthy tissues (n = 5). Our findings reveal that miR-144-5p and miR-130b-5p may have important roles in resistance to mastitis in dairy cattle.

AB Being a key issue in the research and fabrication of silicon heterojunction ( SHJ) solar cells, crystalline silicon ( c-Si) surface passivation is theoretically and technologically intricate due to its complicate dependence on plasma characteristics, material properties, and plasma-material interactions. Here amorphous silicon ( a-Si: H) grown by a planar inductively coupled plasma ( ICP) reactor working under different antenna-substrate distances of d was used for the surface passivation of low-resistivity p-type c-Si. It is found that the microstructures ( i.e., the crystallinity, Si-H bonding configuration etc.) and passivation function on c-Si of the deposited a-Si: H were profoundly influenced by the parameter of d, which primarily determines the types of growing precursors of SiHn/H contributing to the film growth and the interaction between the plasma and growing surface. c-Si surface passivation is analyzed in terms of the d-dependent a-Si: H properties and plasma characteristics. The controlling of radical types and ion bombardment on the growing surface through adjusting parameter d is emphasized. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB With the progressive understanding of liquid crystal materials that rely on the interface interactions, optical properties of liquid crystal are attracting attention as a detector for chemicals and biomolecules. In this work, a recently reported liquid crystal sensing system based on the competitive inclusion effect of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was studied. Quantum mechanical calculations were applied to study different beta-CD inclusion complexes of methyl blue (MB), 4-cyano-4'-pentyl biphenyl (5CB), sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), dopamine (DA) and their inclusion processes. The work shows that DA cannot be an analyte for the liquid crystal sensor as it could not compete for the cavity of beta-CD with SDS. However, MB molecule can push SDS out of the beta-CD cavity so as to induce the change in optical appearance when MB forms a 1:2 inclusion complex. The simulated absorption spectrum is in agreement with experiment results, implying that MB molecule may exist in both 1:1 and 1:2 inclusion complexes in the system of liquid crystal sensor.

AB Certain cultivars of some crops, including durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.), have a propensity to accumulate cadmium in the grain. In the 1980s, a Canadian wheat breeding program generated five pairs of near-isogenic lines of durum wheat that vary in cadmium-accumulation. Within each pair, one member accumulates twofold to threefold higher concentrations of cadmium in the shoot and grain. However, the physiological explanation for the high-low phenotype is unknown. We studied correlations between concentrations of cadmium and non-protein thiols, including phytochelatins, in these five pairs of near-isogenic lines to test the hypothesis that differential retention of cadmium-binding complexes in the root would explain the phenotype. The expected high-low pattern of cadmium accumulation was found in three of the pairs. In one pair, cadmium was positively correlated with cysteine and glutathione in the roots and with phytochelatins 2 and 4 in the shoots but in another pair cadmium was strongly negatively correlated with phytochelatins 2 and 4 in the shoots and unrelated to cysteine or glutathione. No correlations between concentrations of cadmium and the non-protein thiols were found in the third pair or in the remaining two pairs. The production of phytochelatins is a well-described response to cadmium but the lack of consistent correlation between cadmium and non-protein thiols in these five near-isogenic lines indicates that complexation with non-protein thiols does not explain differential translocation of cadmium in durum wheat.

AB Objective: Neurological soft signs (NSSs) may reflect neurodevelopmental anomalies in association with the spectrum of schizophrenia disorders. We examined NSSs in Chinese adolescents with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality traits.
   Methods: Eighty-seven schizophrenic adolescents (SCH group), 85 adolescents with only schizotypal personality traits (SPT group), and 88 healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled. The NSS subscales of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory (CNI) were administered to all 260 participants.
   Results: The NSS prevalence rates were higher in the SCH group than in the other two groups for both hands in the fist-edge-palm, Oseretsky, and graphesthesia tests. Relative to HCs, the SCH group also showed higher NSS prevalence rates in the right finger agnosia and right mirror movement of finger opposition tests. SCH > SPT>HC trends were observed for all NSS subscale scores and for the left, right, and total NSS scores.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine NSSs in adolescents with schizophrenia and adolescents with schizotypal personality traits. These results provide preliminary findings suggesting that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be characterized by developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system, and support the notion that NSSs may be schizophrenia spectrum disorder biomarkers.

It is assumed that the nominal switched nonlinear system is robustly uniformly exponentially stable. It is revealed that there exists a maximal Lipschitz constant, if perturbation satisfies a Lipschitz condition with any Lipschitz constant less than the maximum, then the perturbed system can preserve the stability property of the nominal system. In situations where the perturbations are known, it is proved that there exists an upper bound of coefficient such that the perturbed system remains exponentially stable provided that the perturbation is scaled by any coefficient bounded by the upper bound. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed theoretical results. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene sponge (GS) is a porous 3D structure of graphene. Although hydrothermal reduction, chemical vapor deposition, solution reduction and high temperature annealing could be used for the preparation of GS, the size and shape cannot be well controlled. Herein, we reported a facile method to prepare GS under mild condition in a size and shape controllable way. Graphene oxide was lyophilized to form the spongy structure and reduced by steamy hydrazine hydrate to produce GS. The size and shape of GS prepared were nearly identical to that of the container. The reduction degree of GS could be regulated by the reduction temperature and time.

AB This study addresses the stability problem of perturbed switched systems with time-varying delays and uncertainties. The considered switching signals include five classes and the uncertainties take values on compact sets. It is assumed that the nominal system (perturbation-free system) is robustly uniformly exponentially stable and that the perturbations satisfy vanishing condition plus one of the following three constraints: being locally Lipschitz at origin, globally Lipschitz, and differentiable at origin. By 'vanishing', the authors mean that the perturbation is zero at origin. With these assumptions, it is first revealed that for switched systems being homogeneous of degree one, if the perturbation is sufficiently small, then the perturbed system preserves the stability property of the nominal system, locally or globally, depending on perturbation itself. These results are then applied to switched linear systems with delays, showing that the same conclusion holds for such systems with four types of most frequently encountered uncertainties. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the proposed theoretical results.

AB A two-channel gas chromatography column and a single-channel column were made by deep reactive-ion etching technology. The two short columns were coated with different stationary phases, and then linked without a modulator. This is to aim at increasing the sample capacity and achieving a higher separation efficiency in complex environments. The results show that the capacity of the connected column is approximately 4 and 1.5 times larger than that of the single-and two-channel columns, respectively. The linked column was utilized to separate a six-component mixture, composed of three simulants of nerve and blister agents and three interfering vapors. The results demonstrate that the combined column has a remarkably higher separation efficiency than the individual columns, and an acceptable resolution is achieved although the total length of the linked column is only 1.5 m.

AB Great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) colonies, with bare soil and herbaceous plants, are conspicuous to the background environment throughout their range area. In order to quantify the engineer role of great gerbils, we investigated the plant communities of 20 active colonies in the Junggar Basin, Xinjiang, China. In areas without disturbance, desert plant communities were dominated by the shrubs with low level species richness. In burrow areas and surrounding intermediate areas, which were disturbed by great gerbils, the shrubs were suppressed with the decrease of vegetation cover and aboveground biomass. As a result, "niche gaps" were created in disturbed areas and worked as a refuge for herbaceous annuals and perennials. So the existence of great gerbils increased the overall species richness of the desert. Furthermore, herbaceous annuals and perennials are the major food source for great gerbils in spring, indicating that great gerbils have a mutually beneficial relationship with herbaceous plants.

AB A two-phase material system of nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) embedded in a dielectric matrix of silicon suboxide (SiOx) is fundamentally and technologically significant for the photonic and photovoltaic device such as light emission diode and solar cells. nc-Si in amorphous SiOx has been synthesized by means of the low-frequency (460 kHz) inductively coupled plasma (LFICP) of SiH4 + CO2 + H-2 without the common route of high hydrogen dilution. The chemical composition, microstructures and optical properties of the complex material system are tuned by the reactive gas flow rate ratio of CO2/SiH4. nc-Si embedded in amorphous SiOx due to the phase separation are observed by means of SEM and TEM characterization tools. The crystalline volume fraction in nc-SiOx:H is determined by the density of the embedded nc-Si particles and the occurrence of the a-SiOx encapsulating shell layer. The bond configuration analysis shows the concurrent oxygenation and dehydrogenation process with the incorporation of oxygen. The underlying mechanism in forming the two-phase complex material system and the phase evolution with the reactive gas flow rate ratio are discussed in terms of the unique features of the utilized high-density LFICP.

AB This paper discusses the stability condition for discrete-time multi-valued recurrent neural networks (MVNRNNs) in asynchronous update mode. In the existing research literature, an MVNRNN in asynchronous update mode has been found convergent if its weight matrix is Hermitian with nonnegative diagonal entries. However, our finding has been that the weight matrix with zero diagonal entries cannot guarantee the network stability.

AB This study studies the problem of exponential stability and L-2-gain analysis of a class of switched systems with delay varying in an interval. By using a newly constructed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the average dwell-time scheme, delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained which are expressed as linear matrix inequalities. These conditions provide a solution for finding a switching signal under which exponential stability and normal L-2-gain of the switched delay system are guaranteed. Two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB Fusion reactions can be achieved by using deuterium from sea water as the fuel. The amount of deuterium in one gallon of sea water contains energy equivalent to three hundred gallons of gasoline. Satisfactory conditions of plasma temperature and density necessary to initiate fusion have been achieved in various research facilities. However, the confinement time is not sufficient for ignition due to plasma instabilities. Here we show that fatal plasma instabilities could be suppressed by the ingenious arrangement of multi-pinched plasma beams converging symmetrically in space based on the minimization principle of plasma potential energy. Confirmation tests are proposed using tiny wires containing deuterium. If successful, the results could lead to a feasible approach to obtaining commercial fusion power from sea water, hence without the need to use expensive and radioactive tritium as the fuel.

DT Article
DE quantum effects; fusion enhancement; extremely dense plasma
AB Quantum effects play an enhancement role in p-p chain reactions occurring within stars. Such an enhancement is quantified by a wave penetration factor that is proportional to the density of the participating fuel particles. This leads to an innovative theory for dense plasma, and its result shows good agreement with independent data derived from the solar energy output. An analysis of the first Z-pinch machine in mankind's history exhibiting neutron emission leads to a derived deuterium plasma beam density greater than that of water, with plasma velocities exceeding 10000 km/s. Fusion power could be achieved by the intersection of four such pinched plasma beams with powerful head-on collisions in their common focal region due to the beam and target enhanced reaction.

AB With the aim of investigating the influence of pH value on the properties of NH4Fe2(OH)(PO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O precursor and LiFePO4/C composite, we prepared a series of (NH4)Fe-2(OH)(PO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O by adjusting the pH value in the chemical precipitation process. In addition, the LiFePO4/C composite was fabricated by using (NH4)Fe-2(OH)(PO4)(2)center dot 2H(2)O as precursor. The images of scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the precursor particle size increases as the pH value increases, which facilitates the tuning of the properties of the LiFePO4/C composite. A further investigation indicates that an increase of viscosity of the precipitate slurry in the chemical precipitation process is responsible for the change of precursor particle size. In addition, the electrochemical performance of the LiFePO4/C composite is also governed by pH value. LiFePO4/C composite prepared at the pH value of 4.0 delivers a discharge capacity of 91 mAh g(-1) and 114 mAh cm(-3) at 10 C, showing a capacity retention of 99.48% after 100 cycles, which confirms the excellent rate capability and cycling stability.

TI COLOR FORMING PROPERTY OF DERIVATIVES AND MODIFICATION PRODUCTS OF
   NATURAL IRIDOIDS WITH METHYLAMINE
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN LEATHER CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID HIDE POWDER; GENIPIN
AB Derivatives and modified products of five natural iridoids (geniposide, gentiopicroside, swertiamarin, loganin and morroniside) were obtained by derivatization or modification. Compounds before and after derivatization or modification were adopted to react with methylamine to investigate their color-forming property. The relationship between the color of the pigments and the structure was analyzed using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The results indicated that: (1) when the backbone of the iridoids was the same, the position of the modified substituent groups had the greatest effect on the color of the pigments formed. For example, methygentiopicroside aglycone and methylswertimarin aglycone have a similar skeleton structure, differing only at positions C-5 and C-6, and the pigments obtained from their reaction with methylamine were also similar i.e. bright yellow. However, geniposidic acid aglycone and genipin, which also have a similar skeleton structure, differing only in the substituent at position C-4, produce pigments of different color upon reaction with methylamine, one being dark blue and the other purple red. (2) In different buffer systems, i.e., phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH=8.0) and acetate buffer (ACE, pH=5.0), the same iridoid formed pigments with different colors. (3) After the pi-pi conjugation of benzoyl was introduced to the skeleton of loganin, genipin and morronin as a substituent group, the characteristic absorption wavelength of pigments changed. Taking loganin as an example, the characteristic absorption wavelength of pigments changed from 430 nm and 650, to 465 nm and 670 nm when reacted in PBS, and from 560 nm to 610 nm when reacted in ACE. The reason might be that the conjugation system became longer and the molecular structure became more stable.

AB The focus of wastewater management has evolved from treatment technology into resource recovery, which enables one to minimize contaminants and to generate value-added products. Calvatia gigantea is used not only as a source of food, but has also been used as a traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. In this study, the mycelial production of C. gigantea was studied under submerged fermentation conditions using non-pretreated distilled wastewater from Chinese liquor production. The fermentation medium composition was optimized using response surface methodology involving a Box-Behnken design. Fermentation conditions were optimized using an orthogonal experimental design. The optimized medium composition was the non-pretreated distilled wastewater of Chinese liquor supplemented with cornflour at 2.35 g/100 mL, (NH4)(2)SO4 at 1.11 g/100 mL and CuSO4 at 0.12 g/100 mL. The optimized fermentation conditions were a rotation speed of 150 rpm, an inoculum size of 10% (v/v), a fermentation temperature of 26 degrees C and a fermentation time 4.5days. A maximum mycelial biomass yield of 2.75 g/100 mL was achieved using the optimized medium under the optimized conditions. Results from this study suggest that this is a feasible technology for the mycelial production of C. gigantea using the non-pretreated distilled wastewater from Chinese liquor production.

AB Owing to high energy density and low cost, zinc-ion batteries are gaining much popularity. However, frozen aqueous electrolytes and unstable interface hinder their practical application at extremely low temperature conditions. Herein, a multivariate competitive coordination structure in hydrated eutectic electrolytes is proposed to decrease the freezing point and concurrently construct a stable interface for long-life low-temperature applications. The introduction of second metal cations and organic additives not only breaks the hydrogen-bond network of original water molecules but also competes to reshape Zn2+ solvation shell. To be a result, free water content is decreased, and a stable solid electrolyte interface layer is simultaneously formed. Concomitantly, dendrite-free Zn deposition and excellent Zn plating/stripping at -40 degrees C are achieved. Impressively, the Zn || Zn symmetrical cells with a competitive hydrated eutectic electrolyte demonstrate a stable cycle life of up to 4250 h at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2, and even work for approximate to 1000 h at a discharge depth of 62%. This work provides a unique view of designing anti-freezing electrolytes for zinc-ion batteries, and its universality and applicability will arouse the interest of a series of researchers in the field of electrochemical energy storage.

AB Arabinoxylan (AX) and (1,3)(1,4)-beta-D-glucan (BG), as the main components of cereal grain cell wall polysaccharides, can effectively improve the processing characteristics of grain starch. To enhance starch processing properties, we constructed AX/BG-coated starch granules by simulating the architecture of cereal endosperms. Using rheology, thermal stability analysis, X-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance, we investigated the interactive effects of AX and BG on starch gelatinization and retrogradation. At an AX/BG ratio of 1:1, optimal inhibition of starch gelatinization was observed, with solubility of 7.2 %, swelling power of 11.19 %, and amylose leaching value of 15.69 %. This ratio also preserved the thermal stability of the AX/BG-starch complex gel. At a 1:2 AX/BG ratio, the polysaccharides most effectively suppressed wheat starch retrogradation: after 7 days of storage, gel hardness increased by only 4.75 N and crystallinity increased by only 1.22 %.

AB Liposomes have been widely employed as delivery systems, whereas they suffer from some drawbacks such as low encapsulation efficiency, poor stability during storage and under gastrointestinal tract, and lack of controlled release. To solve these issues, the surface chemistry of liposome technology started by modifying the liposomal surface with different ligands. This review article summarizes the emerging trends in surface-modified liposomes with polysaccharides for delivery of bioactive compounds. The polysaccharides that have been used for liposome surface modification include chitosan and its derivatives, pectin, hyaluronic acid, cellulose, and polysaccharide gums. The strategies of polysaccharide modification, stabilizing mechanisms, advantages and limitations of each of the polysaccharide, and food application are discussed. The combinations of polysaccharides for the production of double-layered liposomes are also highlighted.

AB Background Free-range yak, Tibetan sheep and Tibetan goat, predominantly distributed across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in China, are highly susceptible to a wide range of parasite infections, resulting in underestimated economic losses. We aimed to investigate the biodiversity of gastrointestinal parasites in local ruminants based on 18 S SSU ribosomal DNA gene (18 S rDNA) using next-generation sequencing. Methods Following DNA extraction from 79 fecal samples collected from yak, Tibetan sheep and goat in the southeast part of QTP, we proceeded to amplify the V3-V4 fragments of the18S rDNA gene. Subsequently, we assessed the diversity of parasitic protozoa and helminths. To identify parasitic infection patterns, correlation studies were conducted in different factors, including ages, health conditions and seasons. Results A total of 192 operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified, including 10 phyla and 27 genera. High prevalence was observed in Entamoeba (93.67%), Blastocystis (75.95%) and Trichostrongylus (68.35%). By phylogenetic analysis, we identified a potential new Entmoeba species, along with zoonotic species/subtypes, such as Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Blastocystis ST10, ST12, and ST14. Two rarely reported zoonotic protozoa, Colpoda and Colpodella, were particularly noted for their high prevalence of infection and potential association with diarrhea. Juveniles and adults shared the similar species of parasites. A significant reduction in helminth diversity and infection prevalence was documented during autumn. Conclusions This study provides critical insights into the diversity of gastrointestinal parasites in QTP ruminants, thereby enhancing our understanding of the infection risk in grazing livestock.

AB The continuous accumulation of cadmium (Cd) and microplastics (MPs) in the environment, coupled with their increasing usage and insufficient recycling measures, has increasingly severe impacts on human health, particularly by disrupting the integrity of the intestinal barrier. To investigate the mechanisms underlying intestinal damage in mice exposed to Cd and MPs simultaneously, we conducted a study involving 60 male Kunming mice, aged 8 weeks. The mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group (administered 0.2 mL of saline), the Cd group (administered 0.2 mL of 5 mg/kg CdCl2<middle dot>2.5H(2)O), and the mixed exposure group (administered 0.2 mL of a mixture containing 5 mg/kg CdCl2<middle dot>2.5H(2)O and 1 mg/d MPs). After euthanizing the mice at day 43 via cervical dislocation, we performed histopathological sections of colon tissue, proteomics analysis, metabolomics analysis, and multi-omics integrated analysis. Our findings demonstrate that co-exposure to Cd and MPs disrupts the expression levels of key molecules including glutamate (Glu), transcription factor SP1 (SP1), and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2). This perturbation alters metabolic pathways such as choline metabolism and central carbon metabolism, ultimately compromising intestinal barrier integrity and promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion.

AB In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) that possess both high strength and high ductility. The application of the metastable engineering strategy to enhance the strength and ductility of materials has also gradually been employed, and cryogenic treatment is one of the important techniques in this regard. Through cryogenic liquid nitrogen treatment, this study significantly enhanced the strength and ductility of (CrMnFeCoNi)45Fe55 and (CrMnFeCoNi)40Fe60 HEAs prepared by laser melting deposition (LMD). Compared to the initial samples, the fracture strength of (CrMnFeCoNi)45Fe55 increased from 480 MPa (at room temperature) to 980 MPa (after cryogenic treatment), and the fracture elongation alloy increased from 60 % (at room temperature) to 62 % (after cryogenic treatment). The fracture strength of (CrMnFeCoNi)40Fe60 alloy increased from 550 MPa (at room temperature) to 1150 MPa (after cryogenic treatment), and the fracture elongation decreased from 55 % (at room temperature) to 45 % (after cryogenic treatment). The reduction in stacking fault energy (SFE) through cryogenic liquid nitrogen treatment enables the formation of stacking faults in the alloy system. These stacking faults act as nucleation sites for phase transformations, encouraging the shift of the matrix from a face-centered cubic (FCC) phase to a body-centered cubic (BCC) phase or other phases. This triggers phase transformation-induced plasticity effects (TRIP). The occurrence of phase transformation was confirmed using in-situ cryo-TEM. Simultaneously, the coexistence of two phases mechanism achieves an advantageous balance between strength and ductility. Our study offers novel insights and methodologies for acquiring high-entropy alloys with exceptional comprehensive mechanical properties.

AB Current hydrogen storage technologies face challenges related to safety and high energy costs. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention as promising media for hydrogen storage due to their unique structural and electronic properties. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structure, stability, electronic properties, and hydrogen storage performance of Mg-decorated C7N3 monolayers. Our results indicate that Mg atoms (3-4 atoms) tend to aggregate above the center of the largest pore in the C7N3 framework, with average binding energies of 2.66 eV and 2.34 eV, respectively, which are considerably higher than the cohesive energy of Mg. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations confirm the excellent thermal stability of these configurations. Both 3Mg-C7N3 and 4Mg-C7N3 exhibit outstanding reversible hydrogen storage capabilities, achieving gravimetric hydrogen densities of 6.41 wt% and 6.45 wt% at room temperature-exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy's target of 5.5 wt%. These configurations can adsorb up to 11 and 12 H2 molecules, respectively, with adsorption energies in the range of 0.10-0.17 eV per molecule. Desorption temperatures calculated via the van't Hoff equation suggest that hydrogen desorption occurs at approximately 234 K. Furthermore, reversible hydrogen storage can be achieved under moderate pressures and within a temperature range of 232-395 K. This work identifies Mg-decorated C7N3 as a promising candidate for hydrogen storage applications based on 2D monolayers, providing a design paradigm for next-generation hydrogen storage materials. The study highlights the synergistic effects of electron-donating metals, substrate activation, and layered porous structures, underscoring their combined potential in advancing hydrogen storage technologies.

ID ENTERIC PATHOGENS
AB Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) are strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that can induce diarrhea symptoms in the host, as well as cause disease through contaminated food. To accurately and efficiently identify the five DEC types, this study retrieved the corresponding gene sequences from NCBI based on the virulence genes specified in Chinese national standards: invE, stx1, stx2, sth, stp, lt, aggR, astA, pic, bfpB, and escV. Probes and primers were designed for the conserved regions of these genes, and the amplification system, temperature, and other parameters were optimized. A TaqMan (R) single-plex real-time PCR assay was established for simultaneous detection of Enteropathogenic E. coli, Enteroinvasive E. coli, Enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Enteroaggregative E. coli. The results demonstrated that the minimum detection limit for bacterial genomic DNA was 1.60 x 101 copies/mu L (except for stx2 which was 1.60 x 102 copies/mu L). The within-group variation rate ranged from 0.12 to 0.88%, while the between-group variation rate ranged from 0.67 to 1.62%. Moreover, R2 values for the standard curve generated by this method were between 0.999 and 1 with an amplification efficiency ranging from 98.4 to 100%. We evaluated a total of 122 clinical specimens using both conventional PCR and the qPCR method developed in this study. The findings indicated that the qPCR method exhibited high accuracy. Therefore, this study successfully developed a Taqman real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay with high specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and amplification efficiency as well as significant regression effect. This assay can be utilized for clinical detection of DEC.

AB Excess nitrite in food poses significant health risks, which can lead to diseases such as hypertension and cancer. Therefore, the development of efficient and sensitive methods for detecting nitrite in food is of importance. In this study, we report the ligand-modulated aqueous synthesis of copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) for the wide range linear detection of nitrite in foods. Three different ligands (3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), glutathione (GSH), and polyethyleneimine (PEI)) were used to synthesize water-soluble Cu NCs with distinct fluorescence properties. By optimizing the reaction conditions, blue fluorescent MPA-Cu NCs, GSH-Cu NCs, and green fluorescent PEI-Cu NCs were obtained. The different sizes and chemical properties of these ligands led to variations in the fluorescence stability and oxidation degree of the Cu NCs, enabling the construction of a fluorescence sensor with an extended linear detection range for nitrite. The sensor was capable of rapid visual differentiation and semi-quantitative determination of nitrite in food samples, demonstrating high sensitivity and selectivity, demonstrated a wide linear range from 0.0060 to 10 mM with a low detection limit of 1.14 mu M. This approach provides a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for the detection of nitrite in a wide concentration range, making it a valuable tool for food safety monitoring.

AB To improve the quality and functional properties of yogurts, a multi-starters co-fermentation system was used during yogurt preparation. In this work, Weissella cibaria G232 (added at 0%, 3%, 5%, and 7%) was involved as a co-fermenter with a traditional starter (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus G119 and Streptococcus thermophilus Q019). The results showed that W. cibaria G232 co-fermentation could shorten the fermentation time and significantly enhance the viable counts of yogurt (p < 0.05). Moreover, the incorporation of W. cibaria G232 improved the water holding ability, viscosity, and texture of yogurt. Notably, the highest levels of firmness, consistency, and cohesiveness of yogurt were observed at the 5% addition level of W. cibaria G232. Furthermore, co-fermentation with W. cibaria G232 significantly enhanced the antioxidant activity of yogurt, as evidenced by increased free radical scavenging capacity and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value. The intelligent sensory technology and Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) indicated that co-fermentation with W. cibaria G232 and a traditional starter notably altered the accumulation of aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols in yogurt. These findings suggest that co-fermentation of W. cibaria G232 with a traditional starter present the potential for the quality and functionality improvement of yogurt and also lay the foundation for the application of W. cibaria G232.

AB Zearalenone (ZEN), a mycotoxin, is toxic to skeletal muscle, and the solution to alleviate its damage remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the toxic effect of ZEN on muscle and the mitigation of antioxidants (GSH, NMN, and melatonin) for this toxicity. The results showed that 0.02 mmol/L ZEN inhibited myoblast viability and myogenic differentiation, accompanied by reducing Type I and Type IIA and increasing Type IIX myofibers. Antioxidants (NMN with 0.5 mmol/L, GSH with 1 mmol/L, and melatonin with 1 mmol/L) rescued these phenotypes. Mice that were delivered 3 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day of ZEN by gavage for 35 days exhibited a similar trend of muscle fiber composition, but the gavage of antioxidants (NMN with 500 mg/kg BW/day, GSH with 300 mg/kg BW/day, and melatonin with 100 mg/kg BW/day) abolished this phenotype. Mechanistically, ZEN treatment increased ROS production, resulting in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and, subsequently, myofiber changes. Additionally, ZEN indirectly contributed to its damage, decreasing the abundance of Lactobacillus at the genus level and increasing Streptococcus sp. at the species level, which was associated with lactic acid production. Antioxidants partially rescued this microbiota composition. This study explores ZEN toxicity effects and alleviation of antioxidants, which provides new insights and attenuation solutions for ZEN damage to skeletal muscle. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ZEN and antioxidants in the skeletal muscle still needs to be explored.

AB Emergency evacuation is a critical component of disaster management, particularly in high-altitude remote areas where limited infrastructure, complex terrain, and extreme environments significantly increase evacuation challenges. However, most existing studies focus on urban or low-altitude regions, with limited research on evacuation behavior in high-altitude settings. This study examines Jiangdong Village in Ruoergai County, Sichuan Province, using a human-centered dynamic accessibility measurement approach to assess the impact of high-altitude environments on evacuation efficiency through psychological-physiological data analysis. By analyzing evacuation data from 77 villagers, we constructed a multiple linear regression model (R-2 = 0.846), which revealed a significant positive correlation between age and evacuation time (regression coefficient 0.93, P = 0.006). Younger participants exhibited better physiological adaptability (mean heart rate 106.07 bpm at 50s), whereas older individuals showed a slower heart rate response (mean heart rate 74.14 bpm at 50s) and delayed recovery. Psychological stress was also significantly correlated with evacuation time (correlation coefficient 0.64, P < 0.001), with high-stress individuals evacuating in 229.33s on average, compared to 142.89s for low-stress participants. The findings indicate that psychological stress and heart rate dynamics are key factors influencing evacuation efficiency. This study provides empirical insights for emergency management in high-altitude ethnic villages and proposes optimized evacuation strategies, including real-time physiological monitoring, enhanced psychological support, and tailored evacuation plans for different populations to improve disaster response in high-altitude regions.

AB Soil nitrogen fate determines nitrogen availability for crops and their environmental impact, which is regulated by nitrogen transformation processes that are mediated through soil properties (e.g., pH) and environmental factors (e.g., hydrothermal conditions). Incubation experiments were conducted on soils with different pH levels (covering acidic to calcareous ranges) to study the effects of soil pH and hydrothermal conditions on nitrogen transformation and N2O emissions. The results showed that the net ammonification rate was negatively correlated with soil pH, whereas the net nitrification rate, net nitrogen mineralization rate, and N2O emission rate showed positive correlations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that soil pH and hydrothermal conditions exerted primary influences on soil net nitrogen transformation rates, consequently affecting N2O emissions. Soil pH and hydrothermal conditions had 83% and 93% effects, respectively, on net nitrogen transformation rates, while they had 77% effects on N2O emissions. Consequently, soil pH and hydrothermal conditions might be the key drivers influencing soil nitrogen transformation and N2O emissions. Specifically, in subtropical regions characterized by high temperatures and abundant summer rainfall, regulating soil moisture could mitigate NO3--N accumulation and N2O emissions, providing a targeted strategy for sustainable nitrogen management.

AB Background and aimSoil nutrient availability, acidification associated with plant phosphorus-mining strategies, and fine root foraging all influence nutrient cycling. However, their relative impacts on microbial nutrient cycling during primary succession remain unclear.MethodsWe studied a 130-year primary succession along the Hailuogou post-glacial chronosequence in southwest China. Early-successional stages (1-3) are dominated by Hippophae tibetana, which is gradually replaced by Populus purdomii. In the climax community (stage 4), Abies fabri replaces P. purdomii. We collected rhizosphere soil, roots, and leaves from the dominant species, analyzing how phosphorus-acquisition strategies (proxied by soil pH, leaf manganese concentration and fine-root morphology) influenced bacterial nutrient-cycling gene abundance, based on 16S rRNA sequencing.ResultsRhizosphere pH and the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in ammonium and nitrate assimilation, denitrification and phosphorus mobilization were significantly lower for H. tibetana and A. fabri than for P. purdomii. In contrast, P. purdomii exhibited a significantly higher specific root length. Linear mixed models reveal that leaf manganese concentration was positively correlated with soil acidification. Multiple regression models show that nutrient-cycling potential was more significantly linked to soil pH than to fine-root morphology or soil nutrient availability. Structural equation models indicate that the reduced nutrient-cycling potential was indirectly associated with soil acidification through bacterial co-occurrence networks rather than bacterial richness.ConclusionSoil acidification, associated with phosphorus-mining strategies of H. tibetana and A. fabri, may inhibit microbial nutrient-cycling potential during primary succession. This highlights the interactions between plant nutrient-acquisition strategies and microbial processes in shaping terrestrial nutrient cycling.

AB The transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers are an important factor limiting the yield of photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4). In this paper, K and cyano groups(-C - N) were added into the molecular structure of g-C3N4. The production capacity of the modified g-C3N4 in the liquid-liquid two-phase reaction system composed of benzyl alcohol (BA) and water was 24 times that of the original g-C3N4. The improvement of photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the Kbridge formed by doped K in the molecular structure, which provides an additional channel for the transport of photogenerated carriers. As an electron absorbing group, -C - N can trap photogenerated electrons to form vacancy defects, promoting carrier separation and charge migration. The application of two-phase system can effectively separate H2O2 from oxidation products of sacrificial agents, promoting the forward progress of oxygen reduction synthesis of H2O2 reaction. This study provides new insights for efficient production of H2O2 by photocatalytic technology from the aspects of modification of photocatalysts and optimization of reaction conditions.

AB The intake of dietary fiber can reduce the risk of several major chronic diseases, including colorectal cancer, obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Endogenous dietary fibers such as arabinoxylan (AX) and (1,3)(1,4)-beta-glucan (BG), which have good palatability, are more suitable for addition to cereal foods. We studied starch digestion in the gelatinized AX/BG-starch complexes. To clarify the synergistic role of AX and BG in the starch digestion process and explore the effect of cell wall polysaccharides on the activity of digestive enzymes, the mechanism of action between cell wall polysaccharides and digestive enzymes was analyzed through fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The results of the interaction between cell wall polysaccharides and digestive enzymes showed that the higher the proportion of AX, the stronger the quenching effect on digestive enzymes and the lower the enzyme activity. During the digestion of the AX/BG-starch complexes, in addition to binding to the active sites of enzymes to reduce enzyme activity, AX and BG played a dominant role as barriers. On one hand, they prevented some water molecules from entering the interior of starch granules to inhibit gelatinization. On the other hand, they effectively reduced the bioaccessibility of digestive enzymes.

AB This study explores how academic librarians adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as its main framework, expanded with elements from Personal Innovativeness in IT (PIIT) and the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). A quantitative approach was applied, gathering data from 340 academic librarians and analyzing them using PLS-SEM. The results indicate that facilitating conditions (beta = 0.345, p < 0.001) and effort expectancy (beta = 0.123, p = 0.034) significantly influence behavioral intention, while performance expectancy (beta = 0.091, p = 0.085) and top management support (beta = 0.000, p = 0.997) show limited direct effects. These findings challenge some traditional assumptions of the UTAUT model. Additionally, attitudes were found to mediate the relationship between effort expectancy and social influence on behavioral intentions, while individual readiness and personal innovativeness moderate these relationships (beta = -0.069, p = 0.003), highlighting the importance of individual traits. The model demonstrated strong predictive power, with R-2 values of 0.677 for behavioral intention and 0.574 for actual behavior, along with Q(2) predict values exceeding 0.56. By incorporating PIIT and TRI, this study broadens existing models of technology adoption, offering deeper insights into how organizational factors, personal traits, and readiness interact to influence AI adoption. Practical recommendations include introducing adaptive training programs, personalized support systems, and AI-driven infrastructure enhancements to encourage effective AI integration. Future research should consider longitudinal studies to examine how readiness and innovativeness evolve over time, explore cross-cultural differences, and refine strategies to ensure sustainable AI adoption in diverse academic settings.

AB Adolescence is a critical developmental period characterized by rapid changes in psychological capital and significant challenges in parent-child relationships. However, dynamic studies investigating the interaction between parent-child relationships and psychological capital remain limited. This study adopts a cross-lagged longitudinal design to explore the dynamic relationship between parent-child relationships and psychological capital, with a particular focus on the moderating role of gender. Using a cluster sampling method, a 1-year follow-up survey was conducted with 993 adolescents from four middle schools in Sichuan Province, China. The results revealed the following: (1) Boys demonstrated significantly higher levels of psychological capital compared to girls. Over the 1-year period, psychological capital increased in both boys and girls. However, only boys experienced a significant decline in father-son relationships, while changes in parent-child relationships among girls were not significant. (2) The cross-lagged relationships between parent-child relationships and psychological capital exhibited gender differences. For boys, psychological capital predicted both father-son and mother-son relationships. For girls, a bidirectional predictive relationship was observed between father-daughter relationships and psychological capital. These findings suggest that boys with higher levels of psychological capital are more likely to cultivate strong parent-child relationships, while for girls, positive traits and father-daughter relationships mutually reinforce one another. These insights provide practical implications for mental health education in middle schools.

AB The Sichuan-Chongqing region is among the key regions hosting human activities in Southwest China. Although archeological excavations in the region have been on the rise, providing insights into the regional cultural sequence, research on the evolution process of sites from a twin-city perspective remains limited. In this study, geographic information system (GIS) analysis was used to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of settlements in the region from the Neolithic to Bronze Age. Correlations between the distribution of archeological sites and environmental factors and the directionality of human mobility were wxplored. The results indicate that settlement distribution is strongly influenced by environmental factors. Ancient societies considered moderate elevation, convenient distance from rivers without flooding risk, and suitable soil for cultivation as the three main factors when selecting settlement sites. Sites respond to environmental change in different periods based on various factors, such as the slope, aspect, distance from the river, and soil type, and are mainly located in areas with slopes <10 degrees, facing south or west, and within a 2 km radius of rivers. As human reliance on water resources increases with improved productivity, limitations imposed by the natural environment decrease. Notably, since the Neolithic period, soil fertility, water, and topography have been key factors affecting the distribution of settlements. Compared with single factors, interactions among the factors exhibit greater explanatory power for the regional spatial distribution characteristics of settlement sites in the Sichuan-Chongqing region. The distribution of sites from the Neolithic Age to the Western Zhou Dynasty show a decrease in migration patterns along rivers in the Eastern Zhou Dynasty in the Chongqing region, while also demonstrating enhanced clustering. In addition, the dual-center trend intensified gradually in the Sichuan-Chongqing region.

AB Introduction Music performance anxiety (MPA) significantly impacts musicians' wellbeing and career development, yet the complex interplay between professional competence, psychological risk, and resilience in MPA formation remains understudied. Methods This research investigated these mechanisms through a moderated mediation model among 609 music major students (70.9% female; M age = 20.96 years, SD = 4.52). Participants completed a comprehensive assessment battery including the Professional Questionnaire for Musicians (PQM), Psychological Risk Questionnaire for Musicians (PRQM), Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (K-MPAI), and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and PROCESS macro (Model 7). Results Analysis revealed significant negative correlations between professional competence and both performance anxiety (r = -0.252, p < 0.01) and psychological risk (r = -0.448, p < 0.01). Psychological risk significantly mediated the relationship between professional competence and performance anxiety (indirect effect = -0.171, 95% CI [-0.243, -0.099]). Notably, psychological resilience moderated this indirect effect (moderation effect = 0.188, 95% CI [0.092, 0.284]), with the relationship being strongest at low resilience levels (beta = -0.881, p < 0.001) and weakest at high resilience levels (beta = -0.693, p < 0.001). Discussion These findings validate a complex mechanism wherein professional competence influences performance anxiety through psychological risk, with psychological resilience serving as a crucial moderating factor. The results emphasize the importance of developing multidimensional intervention strategies and provide empirically-grounded guidance for music education practice, suggesting that enhancing both professional competence and psychological resilience may effectively reduce performance anxiety through the mitigation of psychological risk.

AB The lipid profiles in raw fat (RF) and thermal-extracted fat (TF) from yak under hydroxyl radical-induced oxidative stress were investigated. Both hydroxyl radical and thermal extraction accelerated lipid oxidation. A total of 1168 lipids were identified and classified into 18 lipid categories. The top eight classes of lipids included PCs, PEs, TGs, SMs, CERs, PSs, FAs and PAs. Furtherly, 432 differentially abundant lipids were detected in TF samples compared to RF samples. RF and TF samples displayed a complete distinction in lipidomic profiles, and some lipids in both RF and TF samples demonstrated remarkable differences in abundance with the increasing of H2O2 concentration. RF samples demonstrated a relatively higher abundance of PCs, PEs, PSs, PGs and PIs, while TF samples exhibited a higher level of PAs, TGs, FAs and CERs. These findings indicated that radical attack and thermal extraction severely affected lipid oxidation and lipid metabolomics.

AB This paper addresses the prescribed-time formation stabilization in nonlinear multi-agent systems using a novel reinforcement learning-based hybrid impulsive control framework that incorporates delayed control impulses. The approach leverages Lyapunov functionals, impulsive comparison theory, average impulsive interval methods, and graph theory to derive sufficient conditions for achieving prescribed-time formation stabilization. These conditions are formulated in terms of continuous and impulsive feedback gains, time delay durations, and average impulsive interval lengths. Importantly, the inclusion of stabilizing control impulses counteracts the destabilizing effects of continuous dynamics. Additionally, deep reinforcement learning techniques are employed to optimize the impulsive control sequence, aiming to maximize rewards derived from the control objectives and system states. Numerical simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the proposed analytical results, providing comparative assessments of overall control performance.

AB Background and aimsSoil microarthropods play a crucial role in soil ecological processes and are easily influenced by environmental changes. However, the distribution patterns of soil microarthropod communities along climatic zones and the major drivers remain unclear.MethodsThe soil microarthropod communities were investigated on the eastern slope of Mount Gongga, including subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (SEB, 1600 m), subtropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest (SEDB, 2000 m), warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest (WTDB, 2400 m), mid-temperate coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (MTC, 2800 m) and cold-temperate coniferous forest (CTC, 3200 m).ResultsThe differences in the taxonomic composition of soil microarthropod communities between different altitudinal climate zones increased with the interval distance, with the dominant genera abundances (Hypogastrura and Folsomia) varying significantly. The community abundance exhibits an unimodal pattern along the altitudinal zones with maximum values occurring in the WTDB. Alpha diversity stabilizes from the SEB to MTC, but declines significantly in the CTC, while the beta diversity increases slightly from the SEB to WTDB and decreases in the MTC and CTC. The taxonomic composition and abundance of soil microarthropod communities are mainly determined by soil properties, e.g., pH, soil moisture and temperature, K content, while the alpha and beta diversity are mainly affected by the combined and independent effects of climate, vegetation types and soil properties, respectively.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the climate, vegetation types and soil properties have specific effects on the spatial distributions of soil microarthropod communities along an altitudinal climate zone.

AB Soil microbial nitrogen (N) immobilizations are important processes of biogeochemical cycles. How the soil N immobilizations change with increasing N inputs, especially in the subsoil, is not clear. Based on a long-term field manipulative experiment in an alpine meadow, we evaluated changes of soil gross NH4+ immobilization rate (GAIR) and NO3- immobilization rate (GNIR) under six N addition rates at 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm soil depths. The corresponding biotic and abiotic mechanisms were also explored. The results showed that GAIR negatively correlated with N addition rate, but GNIR followed the unimodal response (increase first and then drop down) at all the three soil depths. The decrease in substrate supply by mineralization contributed to the decrease of GAIR with increasing N additions at the three soil depths. The changes of substrate supply by nitrification influenced the response of GNIR in the topsoil, but the changes of fungal abundance mediated the responses of GNIR in the subsoil. The increase in GNIR reduced denitrification derived N2O emission and contributed to retain NO3-, benefitting to the environmental protection. These different responses of GAIR and GNIR to increasing N additions and the different mechanisms underlying the responses from topsoil to subsoil should be considered in biogeochemical models and land management.

AB This article studies the frequency fluctuation problems of a multiarea power system with decentralized control strategy for economic operation under load disturbance and unsecured communication channel. To address the above issues, decentralized bandwidth-aware fuzzy adaptive event triggered mechanism (DBFA-ETM) is proposed to compromise between the utilization of bandwidth resources and the frequency regulation performance by intelligently adjusting the threshold. Then, the decentralized LFC power system model with DBFA-ETM is reconstructed under the mixed attacks. By applying an improved looped-functional, feasible solutions are obtained according to Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that the power system is asymptotically stable with the prescribed H-infinity performance index level. In addition, the frequency regulation performance is optimized by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulation results on a New-England IEEE 39-bus system with quantitative analyses illustrate that the proposed method has the effectiveness and potential on engineering application in the aspect of economic operation.

AB The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is a powerful imaging, diffraction and spectroscopy tool that has revolutionized the field of microscopy. It has contributed to numerous breakthroughs in various scientific disciplines. TEM-based techniques can offer atomic resolution as well as elemental analysis, which benefit the study of epitaxial semiconductors and their related optoelectronic devices on the atomic scale. The design and optimization of the device performance depend on three key factors: the control of strain at nanometer scale, control of the formation and propagation of defects as well as the control of local electronic properties. Manipulation and optimization are only possible if the key factors can be characterized precisely. Herein, the TEM techniques for strain analysis, defect characterization and bandgap evaluation are reviewed and discussed. Lately, with the development of in-situ TEM techniques, researchers have been able to observe dynamic processes and study the behaviour of materials and devices under realistic conditions (in gaseous atmosphere or in liquids, at elevated or cryogenic temperatures, under strain, bias or illumination) in real-time with extremely high spatial resolution. This review explores the impact and significance of in-situ TEM in the field of semiconductors.

AB Sufficiently exploiting the potential of crop photosynthesis is one of the critical ways for improving cultivation production to face global climate change. In this study, oat plants were potted with three watering treatments. The glumes, lemmas, and flag leaves were sampled on days 0, 7, and 14 after the first floret blossomed under the control (denoted as CK-0, CK-7, and CK-14), drought stress (denoted as DS-7, and DS-14) and rewatering treatments (RW-14). Paraffin cross-section structures were observed, and the absolute water content, photosynthetic enzyme activities, carbohydrate content, dry matter weight, and total C and total N accumulation were determined in the glumes, lemmas and flag leaves. The results showed that stomatal tissues were present in both the inner and outer epidermis in the glumes and lemmas, and chloroplasts existed in the cells of both ear organs. Compared to CK-14, the absolute water content was significantly decreased in the flag leaves, stems, and seeds under DS-14, while drought stress did not significantly affect the water status of the glumes, lemmas, and peduncles. Drought stress significantly decreased the PEPC activities in the glumes, lemmas, and flag leaves, and the glumes had significantly higher PEPC activity than the flag leaves in the late stages of grain filling. Compared to CK-7, fructose and sucrose content was significantly decreased in the flag leaves under DS-7, while drought stress significantly increased the fructose, sucrose, and starch content in the glumes and lemmas. In addition, soluble sugar content was significantly increased in all glumes, lemmas, and flag leaves under drought stress. Rewatering significantly increased the carbohydrate content in the flag leaves, while it had no significant effect on the glumes and lemmas. As growth continued, the C and N contents and the dry matter mass in the seeds gradually increased, which was transferred from the glumes, lemmas, leaves, and stems. The results suggest that oats can tolerate a certain degree of drought without affecting the ears' physiological function and yield, and ear organs can maintain water status and photosynthetic performance, which plays a major role in the maintenance of seed yield under drought stress conditions.

AB Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted impressive interest due to their advantages of flexibility, light weight, non-toxicity, and transparency. However, it is not feasible to explore the gigantic chemical space purely through experimental approaches. Herein, a framework based on deep learning models was developed to establish a direct relationship between the molecular structure and device efficiency. Eight graph neural network models were applied to a newly established dataset consisting of 1060 realistic organic donor/acceptor (D/A) pairs to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE). It is notable that the data fidelity and unity were enhanced by manually collecting reported upper limit values. Among these models, the graph attention network (GAT) model exhibited the best performance (r = 0.74, RMSE = 2.63), comparable to previous studies but with significantly lower computational costs. The deep learning models were then employed to predict and screen a developed dataset, consisting of 45 430 possible donor-acceptor combinations, in which the donors and acceptors were sourced from cases with PCE values exceeding 10%. The average predicted PCE range is from 3.61 to 17.43%, and only 2320 (5.1%) D/A pairs were predicted to achieve PCE values above 15%, indicating the importance of theoretical calculations. Several pairs were identified with high PCE values, which were reported in the literature but not in the dataset used in this work. Furthermore, electronic structure calculations were performed on potential candidates to gain insights into the materials, further validating the reliability of the predictions. Our work then provides an efficient workflow to accelerate high-throughput screening of OSC materials, aiding in the development of highly efficient OSCs.

AB In recent years, the widespread use of wood products has been observed in many fields. Wooden products have excellent green and environmentally friendly characteristics, but their performance often cannot meet people's needs. Many researchers have conducted in-depth research on wood-based composite materials and their modification methods in order to improve the performance of wood. This article provides a selective review of the types, modification methods, and properties of inorganic modifiers. The preparation methods are mainly divided into immersion methods, sol-gel methods, and hydrothermal synthesis. The flame retardancy, mechanical properties, hydrophobicity, and mold resistance of modified wood have been effectively improved. In addition, modified wood also has photoresponsive properties, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Finally, the challenges and perspectives on advanced wood-inorganic composites have been proposed for guiding future studies.

AB Calcium-fortified soy protein emulsions stabilized by sodium tripolyphosphate are of considerable importance for the development of calcium-fortified soymilk products. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and stabilities of calcium-fortified soy protein emulsions stabilized by sodium tripolyphosphate. When the concentration of sodium tripolyphosphate ranged from 0 to 0.6%, the emulsion potential and emulsification activity index gradually increased to 35.5 mV and 71.7 +/- 0.8%, while the particle size and flocculation index progressively decreased to 756.2 +/- 41.3 nm and 16.21%, respectively. However, when the concentration exceeded 0.6%, these characterization data plateaued. Microstructural analysis revealed a uniform distribution of droplets. Raman spectroscopy showed an increase in the ordered structure of proteins in the emulsion. Additionally, the centrifugal, thermal, and storage stabilities of the emulsion were enhanced. These findings offer insights into the properties of calcium-fortified soy protein emulsions stabilized by sodium tripolyphosphate and may contribute to expanding their utilization in emulsions and soy products.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Basketball is a group sport that needs precise identification of the players' practical actions in different shooting movements for effective training and performance enhancement. This subjective nature of training assessments that most of the time rely only on coaches' observations, highlights the need for objective analysis tools. The subjective and non-objective nature of present educational calculations that are often based on the observations and experiences of coaches and coaches, highlights the requirement for objective and data-driven analysis tools. Such tools can help trainers make more precise and unbiased calculations of student performance and make better instructional choices. This study presents a new model to identify the basketball technical actions based on combination of the CapsNets or Capsule Neural Networks with an ARPO or augmented variant of Red Panda Optimizer. The study conducts the tasks presented by changing lighting settings and complicated human movements in basketball. By means of the suggested CapsNets/ARPO model, the network's capability can be improved in distinguishing the dynamic targets. The CapsNet/ARPO system reaches advanced performance in the recognition of shooting actions in basketball, with an accuracy of 92.6% and outperforming existing approaches. Its modular design and user-friendly interface make it easily integrable, and a case study with a professional team indicates significant improvements in player performance (15.6% increase in shooting accuracy) and reduced implementation time (30%) to demonstrate its potential to improve basketball analytics and coaching.

   REVEALS
AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a highly contagious swine pathogen, causing respiratory problems in piglets and reproductive failure in sows. Palmitoylation, catalyzed by zinc finger Asp-HisHis-Cys (ZDHHC) domain-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases, plays intricate roles in virus infection. However, whether palmitoylation regulates PRRSV replication is incompletely understood. Here, we report that inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-bromo palmitate (2-BP) promotes PRRSV multiplication. ZDHHC3 is identified as the key palmitoyl transferase regulating PRRSV replication in PAMs infection. Mechanistically, ZDHHC3 catalyzes nucleocapsid (N) protein palmitoylation at cysteine 90. This modification prevents the Nsp9-N protein interaction and subsequent viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, LYPLA1 de-palmitoylates N protein, thus counteracting the ZDHHC3's activity on PRRSV replication. Meanwhile, the administration of small-molecule inhibitor ML348 targeting LYPLA1 could hinder PRRSV-2 replication. In summary, our results underscore the critical role of reversible palmitoylation in PRRSV replication. These findings might provide potential new anti-PRRSV strategies.

AB Introduction Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an important pathogen of enteric and respiratory disease in cattle, resulting in huge economic losses to the beef and dairy industries worldwide. A specific and sensitive detection assay for BCoV is critical to the early-stage disease prevention and control. Methods We established a specific, sensitive, and stable assay for BCoV nucleic acid detection based on CRISPR/Cas13a combined with reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) technology. The specific primers for RT-RAA and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) were designed in the conserved region of the BCoV nucleocapsid (N) gene. Results The detection limit of the RT-RAA CRISPR/Cas13a assays for BCoV detection was 1.72 copies/mu l, and there were no cross-reactions with the other 10 common bovine enteric and respiratory disease-associated pathogens. The coefficient of variations (CVs) of within and between batches were less than 4.98 and 4.58%, respectively. The RT-RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a assays work well in clinical samples of cattle and yak, the BCoV positive rate of 84 clinical samples detected by RT-RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a assays was 58.3% (49/84), it was notably higher than that of RT-qPCR (2.4%, 2/84; p < 0.001). The 49 positive samples detected by RT-RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a assays were further confirmed as BCoV by Sanger sequencing. Discussion A specific, sensitive, and stable assay based on RT-RAA-CRISPR/Cas13a assays for BCoV was developed, providing new technical support for the clinical detection and epidemiological monitoring of BCoV.

AB Current perioperative nutrition management is discouraging due to the under-recognition of clinical nutrition and the lagging development of clinical nutriology. This review aimed to identify and explore epidemiology, related adverse outcomes, controversies, and dilemmas of perioperative nutritional risk/malnutrition to call for further development of perioperative nutritional medicine. Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biology Medicine disc, and Chongqing VIP Database were searched for articles published between January 1, 2014 and August 31, 2024 using the following MeSH terms: ("nutritional risk"[Title/Abstract] OR "malnutrition"[Title/Abstract] OR "undernutrition"[Title/Abstract]) AND ("surgery"[Title/Abstract] OR "surgical"[Title/Abstract] OR "operative"[Title/Abstract] OR "operation"[Title/Abstract]). The incidence of nutritional risk was in the 20% range in patients undergoing elective surgery, 54% in older adults, 44-70% in patients with tumors or major elective surgeries, and 50-55% in children. The incidence of malnutrition ranged from 11-77% in surgical patients. Nutrition-related perioperative adverse events included mainly infection, wound healing disorders, reoperation and unplanned readmission, prolonged hospital stay, mortality, perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction, and venous thrombosis. Current controversies and dilemmas in this field include the low rates of nutrition screening and medical nutrition therapy, numerous nutrition screening tools and malnutrition diagnostic criteria, no consensus on optimal assessment method, low level of evidence-based clinical nutrition research and lack of in-depth mechanistic studies, inconsistent timing of nutrition assessment, lack of reports for community hospitals, small hospitals, and low/middle-income countries or regions, and under-recognition of micronutrient malnutrition. It is, therefore, necessary for perioperative patients to undergo nutritional screening at the first outpatient visit before surgery and/or on admission. Perioperative nutritional management needs urgent attention and requires a multidisciplinary team, including anesthesia, nursing, nutrition, and surgery. We provide targeted suggestions for improving nutrition for those undergoing surgery, including better screening, improved studies and trials, a team medical approach, better documentation, and addressing vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

AB The rational allocation of urban public open spaces (UPOS) is critical for creating a livable urban environment. Traditional Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) models often lack sufficient quantitative analysis regarding the supply of urban public service facilities and population demand. This study, taking the area within Chengdu's Second Ring Road as an example, proposes a 2SFCA model that integrates both supply and demand improvements to evaluate UPOS accessibility. The accessibility results are further analyzed using hotspot analysis, and blind zone detection. In terms of supply improvements, the model incorporates additional indicators beyond the spatial area of UPOS, including service quality and the diversity of surrounding environmental service functions, to better evaluate the overall attractiveness of UPOS to residents. On the demand side, besides population size, the model incorporates the spatial distribution of residents and differences in social characteristics affecting UPOS demand. Results indicate that the improved 2SFCA model, which considers both the attractiveness of UPOS and residents' demand, significantly enhances the accuracy of accessibility assessments. There are substantial differences in service quality among UPOS, while the diversity of surrounding environmental service functions remains generally high. UPOS demand follows a "high in the northeast-low in the southwest" spatial pattern. The spatial distribution of UPOS accessibility shows a "high in the west-low in the east" pattern, opposite to the demand distribution, indicating a supply-demand mismatch. UPOS accessibility identifies one hotspot cluster and four cold spot clusters, with large areas showing no significant characteristics. Additionally, 10.58% of the study area remains blind zones, requiring urgent attention. This study offers a more scientific method and framework for research on the spatial layout and supply-demand matching of UPOS.

AB With the increasing demand for wood in the wood market and the frequent trade of high-value wood, the accurate identification of wood varieties has become essential. This study employs two hyperspectral imaging systems-visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIR) and short-wave infrared spectroscopy (SWIR)-in combination with a deep learning model to propose a method for wood species identification. Spectral data from wood samples were obtained through hyperspectral imaging technology, and classification was performed using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models. Multiple spectral preprocessing and feature extraction techniques were applied to enhance data quality and model performance. The experimental results show that the full-band modeling is significantly better than the feature-band modeling in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Among them, the classification accuracy of SWIR reaches 100%, the number of model parameters is 1,286,228, the total size of the model is 4.93 MB, and the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) is 1.29 M. Additionally, the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) technique was utilized for model interpretability, revealing key spectral bands and feature regions that the model emphasizes during classification. Compared with other models, CNN-Transformer is more effective in capturing the key features. This method provides an efficient and reliable tool for the wood industry, particularly in wood processing and trade, offering broad application potential and significant economic benefits.

AB Histone lactylation, as a common post-translational modification (PTM), is crucial in diseases. Aberrant histone lactylation has been linked to disease pathogenesis, thus positioning it as a therapeutic target. This review summarizes the bidirectional relationship between histone lactylation and diseases, emphasizing how Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) regulates lactate levels to restore histone lactylation homeostasis. Mechanistically, TCM modulates histone lactylation through dual regulation of lactyltransferases and lactate metabolism, thereby influencing disease progression in inflammatory, metabolic, and neoplastic disorders. Notably, TCM is characterized by unique advantages of cost-effectiveness, high efficacy, and minimal adverse effects. For diseases with established drug resistance, TCM offers a promising therapeutic alternative in managing drug-resistant illness by regulating histone lactylation. This review is conducive to understanding the relationship between histone lactylation and disease. TCM effectively treats diseases through the regulation of histone lactylation, thereby highlighting its potential for disease treatment application.

AB Land consolidation (LC) are introduced in agricultural landscapes to streamline mechanical field operations, and increase crop production. However, it may cause adverse effects on landscape patterns, biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services. To investigate the effects of varying intensity of LC (high-, medium-, and low-) on landscape patterns and biodiversity, we selected 30 paddy landscapes in the Chengdu Plain, China. The landscape change before and after LC were compared, and the diversity of vascular plants, rice planthoppers, carabids, spiders, and birds in landscapes with different LC intensities were assessed. The findings revealed that the proportion of semi-natural habitats significantly decreased following LC, while the mean field size significantly increased. As the increase of LC intensify, there was a significant decline in the abundance of spiders and the species richness of ground hunting spiders in 2021, while an increase in abundance of rice planthopper and species richness of omnivorous birds and carnivorous bird. However, the diversity of vascular plants, carabids and also their functional groups, remained largely unaffected. Except the species composition of spider in lowand medium-intensity of LC was significantly different than that in high-intensity in 2021, there were no significant differences were observed in the species composition of birds, carabid beetles, their respective functional groups, and vascular plants. Notably, the abundance ratio of spiders to rice planthoppers in landscape with medium-intensity of LC was significantly higher than in Low- and high-intensity, yet the NDVI of paddy fields showed no significant variation. Overall, a higher intensity of LC corresponded to decline diversity of spiders and increase of rice planthopper, thereby diminishing biological control within the paddy ecosystem. Nevertheless, with the preservation of the original semi-natural habitats and the overall landscape pattern, coupled with an appropriate increase in field size, landscapes with medium-intensity of LC emerged as the optimal strategy to harmonize the benefits of biodiversity and mechanized production.

AB Cadmium and microplastics, common pollutants, can accumulate in the body, impacting the intestinal barrier and harming livestock breeding. In order to explore the damage mechanism of cadmium and cadmium combined microplastic on the colon of mice, 60 mice were divided into three groups: The control group (0.2 mL of saline), cadmium group (Cd group, 0.2 mL of 4.8 mg/kg/d CdCl2) and mixed group (Mix group, 0.2 mL of mixed solution containing 4.8 mg/kg/d CdCl2 and 10.0 mg/d MPs) were fed for 42 d. The changes of colon histopathology were observed, and the changes of microbial diversity and metabolomics of colon contents were analyzed. Pathological sections of the colon showed abnormal mucosal hyperemia with mixed exposure compared to cadmium exposure. Microbial diversity analysis showed increased abundances of Enterococcus, Adlercreutzia, and Bifidobacterium in the Cd and Mix groups, with Dubosiella being the most significantly increased. Metabolomic analysis indicated significant differences in nucleotide and purine metabolism between the Cd and control groups, and in linoleic acid and bile acid metabolism between the Mix and control groups. The ABC transporter metabolites increased with Cd exposure, while the PPAR pathway metabolites were enriched with MPs exposure. Correlation analysis highlighted several key findings: Pasteurella exhibited a notably negative association with pantothenate. Conversely, Enterococcus demonstrated a significant positive link with palmitoylcarnitine. Additionally, both Adlercreutzia and norank_f_Eggerthellaceae showed a positive correlation with azelaic acid. These findings suggest that Cd and MPs disrupt intestinal microbiota and metabolic pathways, providing insights into potential treatments for such exposures.

AB Long-term exposure to high ammonia concentrations could severely impact chicken health. On the other hand, luteolin has been shown to protect against ammonia poisoning. Although phosphorylation is critically involved in toxicity induction, the specific role of phosphorylated proteins in ammonia poisoning remains unclear. Herein, we constructed an in vitro model to study chicken ammonia poisoning and also analyzed the protective effects of luteolin. Specifically, a combined series of organic techniques such as protein extraction, enzyme digestion, modified peptide enrichment, Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, and bioinformatics analysis were employed for a quantitative omics study of phosphorylation modification in three groups of samples. Our findings revealed thousands of Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs). The differentially expressed modified proteins were subjected to GO classification, KEGG pathway analysis, cluster analysis, and protein interaction analysis, revealing the detoxification mechanism encompassed mitochondrial maintenance, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeleton regulation. In the process, mitochondria and Golgi apparatus were the key organelles. Furthermore, the AKT1/FOXO signaling pathway and Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) were the key core modifiers of the proteins. We hope that our findings will provide a theoretical basis and experimental support for future research on luteolin's detoxification mechanism against ammonia poisoning.

AB The transition period is a crucial stage in the reproductive cycle for dams and is linked closely with postpartum recovery, reproduction performance, and health. The confronting problem in the yak industry is that transition yaks under a conventional grazing feeding regime endure nutritional deficiency since this period is in late winter and early spring of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with the lack of grass on natural pasture. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of perinatal nutritional supplementation and early weaning on serum biochemistry, reproductive performance, and metabolomics in transition yaks. Eighteen healthy yaks in late pregnancy (233.9 +/- 18.3 kg, 2-4 parity) were randomly assigned to three groups: conventional grazing feeding (GF, n = 6), additional nutrition supplementation (SF, n = 6), and additional nutrition supplementation with early weaning (SW, n = 6). Yaks in the GF, SF, and SW groups were free grazing on the same pasture in the daytime from -30 to 90 d relative to parturition. Yaks in SF and SW groups received total mixed ration supplementation in the barn during the night throughout the trial. Calves in the SW group were early weaned and separated from the dam at 60 d postpartum. Maternal body weight was measured at -30 and 90 d, and serum samples were collected to analyze serum biochemistry, hormones, and metabolomics at -15, 30, and 90 d relative to calving. In the SF and SW groups, yaks showed significantly higher body weight gain, serum glucose, globulin, and total protein concentrations. Lipid transportation molecules apolipoprotein B100 and very low-density lipoprotein of SF and SW yaks were significantly increased along with the decreased lipid mobilization products non-esterified fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid when compared to GF yaks at -15 and 30 d. At 90 d, serum non-esterified fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid levels were significantly lower in SW yaks than in SF ones, while apolipoprotein B100 and very low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly higher in SW yaks than in GF yaks. The serum levels of metabolic regulatory hormones, including insulin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor I were significantly increased, and glucagon was significantly reduced in the SF and SW groups than in the GF group at -15 and 30 d. Among serum reproductive hormones, SF and SW yaks had significantly higher estradiol and progesterone concentrations than GF ones at -15 and 30 d. Follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormone levels were increased in SW group than in SF and GF ones at 90 d. The calving rates in the following year were 0% (GF), 16.7% (SF), and 83.3% (SW), respectively. The serum metabolomics analysis revealed 848 metabolites in positive mode and 350 in negative mode. With the perinatal nutritional supplementation, the lipid and energy metabolism of transition yaks were improved, meanwhile, lipid mobilization and estrogen production-related pathways were down-regulated. These data suggest that perinatal nutrition supplementation reduces body weight loss, improves glucose and lipid metabolic adaptation to the transition period, and improves yaks' reproductive performance. Additionally, the combination of early weaning and nutritional supplementation results in lower lipid mobilization and up-regulation of lipid transportation and reproductive hormone secretion, which may further contribute to postpartum recovery and acceleration of the reproductive cycle.

AB Photocatalytic technology holds broad prospects for wastewater treatment; however, efficient reactors still face challenges related to optimizing light exposure area and recovering nanoparticles. In this study, we developed an array photocatalytic reactor (APR) using ZrO2-loaded porous glass beads. The performance of the APR was evaluated for the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). The optimal operating conditions for the APR were as follows: a flow rate of 120 mL/min and a liquid layer height of 13 mm. Under these conditions, >99 % of RhB was degraded within 9 h from a 400 mL solution with an initial concentration of 8 mg/L RhB, resulting in complete decolorization. The reaction followed a diffusion-controlled first-order kinetic model, with a rate constant of 0.55 h(-1). Flow and photoreaction simulations in the APR revealed that the local velocity reached up to 0.25 m/s despite a low feed velocity of 0.0111 m/s, indicating that the arrayed microbead arrangement effectively accelerated the liquid flow at low flow rates, thereby enhancing overall reactor performance. This study provides valuable insights into the design and application of photocatalytic reactors for wastewater treatment, promoting the practical application of photocatalytic technology in related fields.

AB Infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) results in enormous economic damage to the global swine industry. PEDV starts its life cycle by binding to the receptors of host cells and adsorbing onto the cellular surfaces. However, it is still unknown how PEDV adsorbs onto the surface of host cells and the mechanism beneath the interplay of host cell transmembrane protein with PEDV proteins. FSTL1, which is a secreted glycoprotein, participates in diverse pathological and physiological processes, including immune modulation and cell proliferation and differentiation. The transmembrane protein, TLR4, serves as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing a broad spectrum of pathogens, which exerts a crucial effect on the host immune system. In this study, we identified that FSTL1 promoted PEDV infection. Further studies demonstrated the interactive relationship between FSTL1 and PEDV structural proteins (N and S2). In addition, we also confirmed that TLR4 interacted with FSTL1 and PEDV N, S1, and S2 proteins on the cell surface. Moreover, FSTL1 promoted the interaction of TLR4 and PEDV and induced viral adsorption to host cells. This study offers explicit evidence that FSTL1 and TLR4 act as mediators for host cell adsorption of PEDV by interacting with PEDV N/S proteins.

AB Traditional engineering education cannot effectively respond to the demand for talents in the construction of smart cities. The application of digital twin technology in education is mostly based on case studies and lacks empirical tests. This study takes the practical teaching of a project-based course on smart city parks as an example to explore the action intention of graduate students to use digital twin technology consistently, and to provide a theoretical basis and teaching practice guidance to promote the rational application of digital twin technology in engineering education. This study set up a quasi-experimental design through the digital twin learning system, grouping 24 graduate students with 4 faculty members. The experimental group is digital twin-assisted practical teaching, and the control group is traditional teaching method, the experimental cycle is 12 weeks, and the total lesson time is 24 h. Secondly, combined with UTAUT2 model and TTF theory, the variable factor hypothesis was adopted as the scale design means, and the experimental validity was improved through questionnaire data analysis. Meanwhile, the influencing factors in the use of digital twin platform were recorded in detail through the process of data collection, data processing and modeling, as well as the application practice of digital twin platform. Finally, the results of the comprehensive survey data show that the graduate students in the experimental group are significantly better than the control group in terms of self-confidence, skill enhancement, learning outcomes, and learning experience. All these results provide information for course teaching practice, training professional teaching teams, optimizing innovative teaching paths, and promoting the cultivation and delivery of smart city technology talents.

AB This study aimed to design a novel antimicrobial peptide, TP I-Y4, through the substitution of four cysteines with tyrosines in tachyplesin I (TP I), and to investigate its structure-activity relationship. TP I-Y4 exhibited reduced hydrophobicity and higher beta-sheet content than the parent peptide TP I, both in aqueous environments and 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). TP I-Y4 demonstrated a potent, dose-dependent affinity for anionic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and showed enhanced antimicrobial activities against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi with minimal toxicity. Structural modifications in TP I-Y4 increased adsorption to bacterial cell surfaces, resulting in significant reductions in surface electronegativity and increases in surface hydrophobicity than TP I. These changes are hypothesized to enable TP I-Y4 to inflict more damage to bacterial membranes, as well as liposome membranes, during peptide integration into the phospholipid bilayer. Fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that both peptides were capable of integrating into the phospholipid bilayer, however, TP I-Y4 displayed stronger binding and insertion abilities. These findings indicated that neither disulfide linkage nor Cys is essential for antimicrobial functionality. The reduced hydrophobicity, higher beta-sheet content, and more flexibility are proposed as key factors contributing to the superior antimicrobial activity and substantially reduced cytotoxicity of the peptide derivative.

AB Bile acids (BAs) are significantly altered in the liver and serum of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the underlying mechanisms of these changes, particularly BA alternative pathways (BAP) responsible for non12-OH BAs, remain unclear. RNA-seq data were initially analyzed to reveal the changes of gene expression in NASH patients. Targeted metabolomics were conducted on plasma from NASH mice induced by high-fat or western diet with CCl4 for 10-24 weeks. Liver tissues were examined using proteomics, RT-qPCR, and western blotting. An integrated approach was then employed to analyze protein interactions and network correlations. Analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the inhibition of CYP7B1 in NASH patients, indicating the dysregulation of BAP. In NASH mouse models, dysregulation of BA circulation was observed by increased plasma total BA (TBA) levels and decreased liver TBA, with liver swelling and histopathological changes. Targeted metabolomics revealed suppressed levels of non12-OH BAs, which inversely correlated with increased liver injury markers. The reduced mRNA and protein expression of Fxr and upregulation of Lxr signaling in livers suggested the suppressed BAP was modulated by Fxr-Lxr signaling. Moreover, BAP interactions predominantly implicated multiple metabolism disruptions, involving 7 hub proteins (Hk1, Acadsb, Pklr, Insr, Ldlr, Cyp27a1, and Cyp7b1), offering promising therapeutic targets for NASH. We presented the metabolic and proteomic map of BAP and its regulatory network in NASH progression. Therapeutic targeting of BAP or its co-regulatory proteins holds promise for NASH treatment and metabolic syndrome management.

AB For the problems of weak object feature expression and variable object orientation in aerial image object detection, this paper proposed a feature enhanced YOLOv7 for rotated small object detection in aerial images. Firstly, for the problem of feature loss in the feature extraction stage, the feature enhanced spatial pyramid pooling and cross stage partial connections module was proposed, which effectively boost the feature expression of small object. Secondly, an attention guided max-pooling module was constructed to address the problem of feature loss. Then, the rotated object detection head was introduced to solve the problem of false negatives caused by variable object angles and dense object distribution. Finally, a multi-scale loss function was proposed for improving the detection effects of rotated small objects detection in aerial images. Extensive experiments were conduct on the public datasets of DOTA and University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences-AOD, with the help of the proposed method, we can achieve the detection accuracy that the mean average precision are 79.7% and 98.9%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has a significant improvement on the detection of small targets in aerial images.

TI Balancing High-performance and Lightweight: HL-UNet for 3D Cardiac
   Medical Image Segmentation
SO ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY

DE High-performance 3D segmentation; Lightweight neural network; HL-UNet;
   Cardiac medical segmentation
AB Rationale and Objectives: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is a crucial tool for analyzing, diagnosing, and formulating treatment plans for cardiovascular diseases. Currently, there is very little research focused on balancing cardiac segmentation performance with lightweight methods. Despite the existence of numerous efficient image segmentation algorithms, they primarily rely on complex and computationally intensive network models, making it challenging to implement them on resource-constrained medical devices. Furthermore, simplified models designed to meet the requirements of device lightweighting may have limitations in comprehending and utilizing both global and local information for cardiac segmentation. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel 3D high-performance lightweight medical image segmentation network, HL-UNet, for application in cardiac image segmentation. Specifically, in HL-UNet, we propose a novel residual-enhanced Adaptive attention (REAA) module that combines residual-enhanced connectivity with an adaptive attention mechanism to efficiently capture key features of input images and optimize their representation capabilities, and integrates the Visual Mamba (VSS) module to enhance the performance of HL-UNet. Results: Compared to large-scale models such as TransUNet, HL-UNet increased the Dice of the right ventricular cavity (RV), left ventricular myocardia (MYO), and left ventricular cavity (LV), the key indicators of cardiac image segmentation, by 1.61%, 5.03% and 0.19%, respectively. At the same time, the Params and FLOPs of the model decreased by 41.3 M and 31.05 G, respectively. Furthermore, compared to lightweight models such as the MISSFormer, the HL-UNet improves the Dice of RV, MYO, and LV by 4.11%, 3.82%, and 4.33%, respectively, when the number of parameters and computational complexity are close to or even lower. Conclusion: The proposed HL-UNet model captures local details and edge information in images while being lightweight. Experimental results show that compared with large-scale models, HL-UNet significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity while maintaining performance, thereby increasing frames per second (FPS). Compared to lightweight models, HL-UNet shows substantial improvements across various key metrics, with parameter count and computational complexity approaching or even lower.

AB Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs) are somatic cells surrounding the oocyte that play an important role in oocyte growth, meiotic maturation, ovulation, and fertilization in mammals. Therefore, revealing the molecular mechanisms related to the development and function of CGCs is essential for further understanding the regulatory network in female reproduction. MSX2 belongs to the highly conserved msh homeobox gene family and plays diverse roles in different biological processes. This study cloned the coding sequence (CDS) of the yak MSX2 gene and detected the abundance and localization of MSX2 in the major female reproductive organs. The results indicated that the CDS of this gene included 747 base pairs and encoded 248 amino acids. The abundance of MSX2 mRNA was highly expressed in the luteal phase of the yak ovary during the estrous cycle, and MSX2 protein was widely expressed in different female reproductive organs, including the ovary, corpus luteum, uterus, and oviduct. Repressing MSX2 abundance in yak CGCs declined the cell viability and defective steroidogenesis. Several genes abundances related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and sterogenesis also changed after MSX2 knockdown. MSX2 overexpression had the opposite effect on cell viability in yak CGCs. These results reveal the specific mechanism by which MSX2 regulates the development and function of yak CGCs and give novel and valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in yak reproduction.

AB Infection with drug-resistant bacteria and the formation of biofilms are the main factors contributing to wound healing insufficiency. Antibacterial agents with enzyme-like properties have exhibited considerable potential for efficient eradication of drug-resistant microorganisms due to their superior sensitivities and minimal side effects. In this work, we prepared a kind of Fe-centered single-atom nanozyme (Fe-SAzyme) with high biocompatibility and stability via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, which was suitable for the treatment of wounds infected with drug-resistant bacteria. The Fe-SAzyme exhibited remarkable peroxidase-like catalytic activities, catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to highly toxic hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), which could not only damage bacterial cells but also inhibit, disrupt, and eradicate the formation of bacterial biofilms. Thus, Fe-SAzyme demonstrated a broad-spectrum antibacterial performance capable of effectively eliminating multidrug-resistant bacteria. The coexistence of ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) ions in Fe-SAzyme conferred the nanozyme with anti-inflammatory activity, effectively suppressing excessive inflammation. Meanwhile, Fe-SAzyme could significantly downregulate inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta and upregulate growth factors VEGF and epidermal growth factor, which can prevent bacterial infection, mitigate inflammation, promote fibroblast proliferation, and improve wound closure. Thus, Fe-SAzyme had shown favorable therapeutic efficiency in promoting bacteria-infected wound healing. This study provides Fe-SAzyme as a promising candidate for the development of new strategies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

ID SIDE MANAGEMENT
AB As an effective strategy for load management in smart grids, demand response establishes a bidirectional connection between the electricity supplier and users. Based on the networked evolutionary game theory, this paper studies the demand-response issue for a class of smart grids by using the semi-tensor product of matrices. The paper proceeds as follows. (i) Considering the dynamic interactions between the supplier and users, the demand response is modeled as a heterogeneous networked evolutionary game and is expressed as dynamical form by semi- tensor product. (ii) A sufficient and necessary condition is provided to verify the convergence to a fixed point of the considered system. (iii) A feedback controller is designed to ensure the system electricity consumption and price to maintain at a desired level. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Herpetospermum pedunculosum (Ser.) C.B. Clarke (HP), a traditional Tibetan medicine used to treat hepatobiliary diseases, was confirmed that lignans-enriched ethyl acetate extract of HP (EAHP) could alleviate the hepatic injury by modern pharmacological evidence. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of EAHP against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still unknown. Aim of the study: To reveal the effects of EAHP on NAFLD and explore the potential mechanisms from the perspective of lipidomics and transcriptomics. Materials and methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis was carried out to investigate the chemical components of EAHP. A Choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined, high fat diet (CDAHFD) was used to establish a NAFLD mouse model. The anti-NAFLD effects of various dosages of EAHP were evaluated by biochemical indexes and histological analysis. Hepatic lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis and multiple bioinformatics methods were used to screen biomarkers and signaling pathways. The levels of the corresponding genes were verified by qPCR. Results: 36 kinds of compounds were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Oral treatment with EAHP significantly decrease the liver index and the levels of ALT and AST in the serum. The measurements lipid content and Oil Red O staining results suggested that EAHP ameliorated lipid metabolism disorders by reducing the content of TG and LDL-C, increasing HDL-C in the liver. H&E &E staining and ELISA revealed that EAHP restored hepatic inflammatory infiltration and decrease the levels of IL-1 beta, beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and increase IL-10 in the serum. Lipidomic analysis showed that EAHP could regulate CDAHFD-induced lipid metabolic disorder. The different lipid metabolites included TG, phosphatidyl choline (PC), diacylglycerol (DG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), ceramide (Cer). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Bmp8b, , Nbl1, , Rgma, , Sphk1, , Thbs1, , and Ugt8a were important regulators, which were associated with TGF-beta beta signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. The expressions of above genes detected by were qPCR consistent with transcriptomic data. Conclusions: The ameliorative effects of EAHP on NAFLD are potentially attributable to the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and TGF-beta beta signaling pathway, etc ., which results in abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammatory response.

ID IMPACT
AB With the acceleration of urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a major environmental challenge, severely affecting the quality of life of residents and the ecological environment. Quantitative analysis of the factors influencing urban heat island intensity (UHII) is crucial for precise urban planning. Although extensive research has investigated the causes of UHI effects and their spatial variability, most studies focus on macro-scale analyses, overlooking the spatial heterogeneity of thermal characteristics within local climate zones (LCZs) under rapid urbanization. To address this gap, this study took the central urban area of Chengdu, constructing a LCZ map using multisource remote sensing data. Moran's Index was employed to analyze the spatial clustering effects of UHI across different LCZs. By constructing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, the study further explored the influencing factors within these climate zones. The results showed that: (1) Chengdu's built and natural environments had comparable proportions, with the scattered building zone comprising the highest proportion at 22.12% in the built environment, and the low vegetation zone accounting for 21.8% in the natural environment. The UHII values in this study ranged from 10.2 degrees C to -1.58 degrees C, based on specific measurement conditions. Since UHII varied with meteorological conditions, time, seasons, and the selection of rural reference points, these values represented dynamic results during the study period and were not constant. (2) Chengdu's urban spatial morphology and UHII exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, with a global Moran's I index of 0.734, indicating a high degree of spatial correlation. The highest local Moran's I value was found in the proportion of impervious surfaces (0.776), while the lowest is in the floor area ratio (0.176). (3) The GWR model demonstrated greater explanatory power compared to the OLS model, with a fit of 0.827. The impact of spatial morphological factors on UHII varied significantly across different environments, with the most substantial difference observed in the sky view factor, which has a standard deviation of 13.639. The findings provide precise recommendations for ecological spatial planning, aiming to mitigate the UHI effect and enhance the quality of life for urban residents.

AB There is robust evidence that social relationships are positively associated with self-esteem, but little is known about how changes in social relationships and self-esteem are associated within individuals. This longitudinal study examined the within-person association between social relationships and self-esteem and the association across developmental stages and gender. A total of 1,240 middle and high school Chinese students (636 girls; initial Mage = 13.4 years) completed measures of self-esteem and paternal, maternal, peer attachment, and teacher-student relationship three times over one year (five-month and six-month interval). Random intercept cross-lagged panel models indicated that bidirectional, within-person association between social relationships and self-esteem among adolescents varied depending on relationship sources, developmental stages, and gender. Specifically, within-person effects indicated that increases in social relationships predicted increases in self-esteem among early adolescents, while increases in self-esteem predicted increases in social relationships among middle adolescents. Moreover, within-person effects suggested that increases in maternal attachment and teacher-student relationship predicted increases in self-esteem among early male adolescents, while increases in teacher-student relationships and paternal attachment predicted increases in self-esteem among early female adolescents. These findings have important theoretical implications regarding the association between self-esteem and social relationships in adolescents and practical implications for improving adolescents' self-esteem and social relationships.

AB Well production forecasting can provide scientific guidance for oilfield production and management, which is an indispensable part of the oilfield development process. In this study, the daily oil production data from oil wells are first decomposed into components with different frequencies by variational mode decomposition (VMD), which is usually used to process complex time series. The new features obtained from decomposition and other filtered features are then used as input data and for training and forecasting of GRU, TCN and Transformer models respectively. In the end, the three models are integrated as base learners using the Blending method, which specifically involves using the predicted outputs of the three models as new inputs to the RBFNN for training and realizing the final predictions. The VMD-Blending model was compared with traditional models based on the production dynamics data of three production wells in an oil field in the Tarim area, China. The result shows that VMD can effectively improve the prediction effect of the base learners, and the prediction effect of these models is further improved after Blending integration, and all of their prediction indexes are significantly better than those of the base learners and the traditional SVM and RNN models. The proposed VMD-Blending model has a well performance in the task of well capacity prediction and is an accurate and effective method for oil production prediction.

AB Although numerous studies have explored the causes and consequences of intrinsic and extrinsic life goals, the developmental trend of life goals during adolescence has not been well understood. To address this research gap, this study explored the developmental changes of the pursuit of intrinsic and extrinsic goals during early, middle, and late adolescence, and examined the relation between life goals and internalizing/externalizing problems from a developmental perspective. A total of 4703 Chinese adolescents from primary (N=1819, 47.8% girls, M-age T1=9.34, SDage T1=0.58), middle (N=1525, 47.5% girls, M-age T1=12.47, SDage T1=0.59), and high school (N=1646, 51.9% girls, M-age T1=15.45, SDage T1=0.65) participated in this two-year, three-wave longitudinal study. The results revealed that the pursuit of intrinsic goals increased among primary school students, but decreased among middle and high school students. Conversely, the pursuit of extrinsic goals exhibited a consistent increase among adolescents in primary, middle, and high school. Girls have higher initial levels of intrinsic goals than boys in primary school, and boys' intrinsic goals declined faster than girls' in middle school. Additionally, the initial level and developmental rate of intrinsic goals among three developmental stages were significantly associated with internalizing/externalizing problems, with lower initial level, slower growth rate, and faster decline rate being associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. The significant association between the initial level and developmental rate of extrinsic goals and internalizing/externalizing problems were mainly observed among late adolescents, with higher initial level and growth rate being associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. These findings delineate the differences in developmental trends between intrinsic and extrinsic goals, underscore the robust relation between intrinsic goals and internalizing/externalizing problems, and figure out the development-stage differences in the relation between extrinsic goals and internalizing/externalizing problems.

AB Severe open wounds should be closed immediately and regularly undergo re-examination and debridement. Therefore, dressings should effectively cover the wound, creating a moist environment for healing while meeting mechanical requirements for daily movement and adaptability. Herein, a low-cost and easy-to-prepare plant polysaccharide hydrogel was reported. The Mesona chinensis Benth polysaccharide strengthened the hydrogel network by hydrogen bonding and changed the phase transition temperature, but retained the thermal response characteristics of the hydrogel. By adjusting the polysaccharide concentration, MepGel(1) can be prepared to remain stable as a semisolid at body temperature and transform into a shear-thinning semifluid state when appropriately heated. The composite hydrogel could be easily shaped, effectively closing wounds of different shapes, while maintaining excellent mechanical properties. Importantly, this composite hydrogel had a near-infrared photothermal effect resulting in excellent antibacterial effect and collided with its own thermal response producing functions conducive to wound care, like accelerating the self-healing of the dressing, achieving re-adhesion, and further covering the wound. Furthermore, the hydrogel had excellent biocompatibility, enhancing immunity and promoting healing of bacterial-infected wounds. The low cost and rich functionality demonstrated by MepGel had the potential to face the enormous challenges and economic burden of clinical wound healing.

AB Introduction Weak aerobic stability is a notable challenge for whole-plant corn silage, particularly in hot and humid regions. Acetobacter is commonly regarded as an indicator of aerobic deterioration in silage, yet its precise role in fermentation and during aerobic exposure, as well as the factors that promote its growth, remain insufficiently understood. Methods In this study, whole-plant corn silage was prepared using a bagged method with controlled dry matter (DM) content at 20%, 25%, and 30%, and initial concentrations of A. pasteurianus at 40%, 50%, and 60%. The silage was stored for 60 days under varying temperatures (20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 40 degrees C). Following the anaerobic storage phase, the silage was exposed to air at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) for 7 days, both with and without A. pasteurianus inoculation. Results The results demonstrated that A. pasteurianus did not impact the nutritional value of the silage during anaerobic fermentation, maintaining a low pH (< 3.80). However, during aerobic exposure, the presence of A. pasteurianus significantly reduced the aerobic stability of the silage. The microbial community shifted from primarily Klebsiella species initially to Lactobacillus and Acetobacter species post-ensiling. During the aerobic exposure phase, A. pasteurianus and A. fabarum became the dominant species. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) analysis identified optimal conditions for the proliferation of A. pasteurianus during the aerobic phase, which occurred at 28 degrees C, 25% DM, and 52% initial concentration at 3 ml/kg. Discussion These findings confirm that A. pasteurianus plays a critical role in reducing the aerobic stability of whole-plant corn silage. Additionally, the study identifies the optimal conditions that favor the proliferation of A. pasteurianus, offering valuable insights for the development of strategies to prevent and control this bacterium, thereby improving the aerobic stability of silage in hot and humid regions.

AB Introduction The most common factor leading to renal failure or death is renal IR (ischemia-reperfusion). Studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their exosomes have potential therapeutic effects for IR injury by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization and inflammation. In this study, the protective effect and anti-inflammatory mechanism of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (ADMSC-Exos) after renal IR were investigated.Method Initially, ADMSC-Exos were intravenously injected into IR experimental beagles, and the subsequent assessment focused on inflammatory damage and macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, an in vitro inflammatory model was established by inducing DH82 cells with LPS. The impact on inflammation and macrophage phenotype was then evaluated using ADMSC and regulatory miR-146a.Results Following the administration of ADMSC-Exos in IR canines, a shift from M1 to M2 macrophage polarization was observed. Similarly, in vitro experiments demonstrated that ADMSC-Exos enhanced the transformation of LPS-induced macrophages from M1 to M2 type. Notably, the promotion of macrophage polarization by ADMSC-Exos was found to be attenuated upon the inhibition of miR-146a in ADMSC-Exos.Conclusion These findings suggest that miR-146a plays a significant role in facilitating the transition of LPS-induced macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype. As a result, the modulation of macrophage polarization by ADMSC-Exos is achieved via the encapsulation and conveyance of miR-146a, leading to diminished infiltration of inflammatory cells in renal tissue and mitigation of the inflammatory reaction following canine renal IR.

AB Large herbivore grazing plays a key role in regulating ecosystem functioning and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects and mechanisms of large herbivore grazing intensity on soil nutrient fractions remain largely unclear in alpine grasslands. Here, we determine 20 indicator variables associated with soil nutrient fractions (e.g., particulate organic carbon, POC; mineral-associated organic carbon, MAOC) to investigate how grazing intensity on labile fractions through a well-controlled grazing experiment in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon, light fraction organic carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and phosphorus, total potassium, and available potassium significantly decrease with increased grazing intensity, whereas other fractions (e.g., POC, MAOC, dissolved organic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available nitrogen, etc.) have marginal or non-significant responses to grazing intensity. Further analysis reveals that above-and below-ground biomass, soil moisture, and soil pH jointly determine the grazing effects on soil nutrient fractions, without the impact of species richness. Moreover, correlation analyses indicate that grazing intensity decouples carbon and nitrogen from phosphorus and potassium in alpine meadows. Collectively, our results emphasize the importance of grazing intensity effects on nutrient cycling in alpine grasslands and incorporate the impacts of grazing intensity into terrestrial ecosystem models may help accurately predict carbon sequestration potential in grazinglands.

AB The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of FAM13A on the differentiation of goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes and its mechanism of action. Here, we cloned the CDS region 2094 bp of the goat FAM13A gene, encoding a total of 697 amino acid residues. Functionally, overexpression of FAM13A inhibited the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes with a concomitant reduction in lipid droplets, whereas interference with FAM13A expression promoted the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes. To further investigate the mechanism of FAM13A inhibiting adipocyte differentiation, 104 differentially expressed genes were screened by RNA-seq, including 95 up-regulated genes and 9 down-regulated genes. KEGG analysis found that the RIG-I receptor signaling pathway, NOD receptor signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway may affect adipogenesis. We selected the RIG-I receptor signaling pathway enriched with more differential genes as a potential adipocyte differentiation signaling pathway for verification. Convincingly, the RIG-I like receptor signaling pathway inhibitor (HY-P1934A) blocked this pathway to save the phenotype observed in intramuscular adipocyte with FAM13A overexpression. Finally, the upstream miRNA of FAM13A was predicted, and the targeted inhibition of miR-21-5p on the expression of FAM13A gene was confirmed. In this study, it was found that FAM13A inhibited the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes through the RIG-I receptor signaling pathway, and the upstream miRNA of FAM13A (miR-21-5p) promoted the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes. This work extends the genetic regulatory network of IMF deposits and provides theoretical support for improving human health and meat quality from the perspective of IMF deposits.

AB Oat (Avena sativa) is one of the most important cereal crops and cool-season forage grasses in the world. The calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) gene family is one of the largest families in plants, and it plays vital roles in multiple biological processes. However, the CAMTA genes in oats, especially those involved in abiotic stress, have not yet been elucidated. Herein, our findings reveal the presence of 20 distinct AsCAMTA genes, which were clustered into three subfamilies based on their gene structure and conserved motifs, indicating functional similarities within each subgroup. Chromosomal mapping indicated an uneven distribution across 10 chromosomes, suggesting a complex evolutionary history marked by potential gene duplication events. The results showed that most AsCAMTA genes contained stress-related cis-elements. The study further investigated the expression patterns of these genes under abiotic stress conditions utilizing RT-qPCR analysis. The results identified three AsCAMTA genes (AsCAMTA5, AsCAMTA7, and AsCAMTA19) that exhibited significant up-regulation under salt stress, with AsCAMTA7 also showing a marked increase in expression under drought stress. These findings suggest a pivotal role of AsCAMTA5, AsCAMTA7, and AsCAMTA19 genes in mediating the responses to various abiotic stresses by integrating multiple stress signals in oats. This investigation provides valuable insights into the potential functions of AsCAMTA genes in the stress response mechanisms of oats, laying a foundation for further functional studies aimed at enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in crops.

AB With the gradual expansion of Android systems from mobile phones to intelligent devices, a huge amount of malware has been found every year. To improve the malware detection performance and reduce its reliance on expert experience, deep learning technology has been widely used. However, as the complexity of deep learning models continues to increase, it rapidly increases the consumption of hardware resources. At the same time, anti-detection technology such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used to evade Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based detection methods. In this paper, we propose a new classification model based on an improved lightweight neural network that can effectively improve the execution efficiency and detection performance of malware detection methods against adversarial malware samples. First, our method uses local-information-entropy-based image generation technology to construct effective image feature vectors. Then, the performance of the lightweight neural network model ESPNetV2 is improved from four aspects. Finally, a new adversarial malware generation model called Mal-WGANGP is proposed. It can automatically generate a large number of adversarial samples to robust our model. In order to evaluate our method, we construct several experiments and compare the detection performance of our method with 19 other novel efficient neural network detection models. Experimental results show that our image enhancement method and detection model have the highest detection accuracy of adversarial samples.

AB Neighborhood rough set theory is an important computational model in granular computing and has been successfully applied in many areas. One of its most prominent applications is in attribute reduction. However, most current attribute reduction methods for neighborhood rough sets are supervised or semi-supervised, which makes them unable to handle datasets without decision information. To address this, we propose an unsupervised attribute reduction strategy based on neighborhood dependency. First, a neighborhood rough set model based on conditional attribute sets is constructed. Then, based on all individual attribute subsets in the datasets, the importance of the attributes is defined to indicate the significance of the candidate attributes. Furthermore, a neighborhood dependency-based unsupervised attribute reduction (NDUAR) algorithm is designed. Finally, NDUAR is compared with existing algorithms on publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that NDUAR can select fewer attributes to maintain or improve the performance of the clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper is thereby confirmed.

AB The utilization of advanced photothermal materials for personal thermal management to improve thermal comfort and regulate heat exchange between the human body and the environment is a focal point of research. Herein, this study presents the design of in situ metal-ion-incorporated photothermal GO films with high light capture efficiency (98.51% of GO-Fe-0.3 film) and exceptional photothermal conversion capability (similar to 61.3 degrees C under 1 solar illumination), offering temperature adjustability within the range of 39.1-61.3 degrees C. This temperature adjustability is facilitated by the straightforward control of the metal ion content, which enables versatile applications in daily human thermal regulation and high-temperature medical contexts. Furthermore, this strategy demonstrates scalability and flexibility through the variation of metal ion types. Practical simulations using a tailored flexible and wearable device reveal a rapid temperature increase of similar to 61.5 degrees C within 600 s. Therefore, the in situ metal-ion-incorporated photothermal GO films exhibit significant potential in advancing photothermal conversion for adaptable personal thermal management.

AB The complexity and compensatory evolution of tumors weaken the effectiveness of single antitumor therapies. Therefore, multimodal combination therapies hold great promise in defeating tumors. Herein, we constructed a multi-level regulatory co-delivery system based on chemotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy. Briefly, curcumin (Cur) was prepared as nanoparticles and coated with polydopamine (PDA) to form PCur-NPs, which along with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (indoximod, IND) were then loaded into a thermosensitive Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogel to form a multifunctional nanocomposite hydrogel (PCur/IND@Gel). The in situ-formed hydrogel exhibited excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and sustained drug release behavior both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, PCur-NPs showed enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxicity under NIR laser irradiation and induced potent immunogenic cell death (ICD). After intratumoral injection of PCur/IND@Gel, significant apoptosis in 4T1 tumors was induced, dendritic cells in lymph nodes were highly activated, potent CD8+ and CD4+ antitumor immune responses were elicited and regulative T cells in tumors were significantly reduced, which notably inhibited the tumor growth and prolonged the survive time of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, this injectable nanocomposite hydrogel is a promising drug co-delivery platform for chemophotothermal-immunotherapy of breast tumors.

AB Aggregation-induced emission (AIE)allows tunable photoluminescence via the simple regulation of molecular aggregation. The research spurt along this vein has also offered tremendous opportunities for light-responsive artificial molecular machines that are to be fully explored for performing versatile functions. Herein, the study reports a light-driven Feringa-type motor, when in the appropriate aggregation state, not only demonstrates the light-activated rotary motion but emits photons with good quantum yield. A semi-quantitative TD-DFT calculation is also conducted to aid the understanding of the competitive photoluminescence and photoisomerization processes of the motor. Cytotoxicity test shows this motor possesses good biocompatibility, laying a solid foundation for applying it in the bio-environment. The results demonstrated that the engagement of the aggregation-induced emission concept and light-driven Feringa-motor can lead to the discovery of the novel motorized AIEgen, which will further stimulate the rise of more advanced molecular motors capable of executing multi-functionalities.

AB Buckwheat sprouts are rich in pectic polysaccharides, which possess numerous health-improving benefits. However, the precise structure-activity relationship of pectic polysaccharides from Tartary buckwheat sprouts (TP) is still scant, which ultimately restricts their applications in the food industry. Hence, both ultrasoundassisted Fenton treatment (UAFT) and mild alkali treatment (MATT) were utilized for the modification of TP, and then the effects of physicochemical characteristics of original and modified TPs on their bioactivities were assessed. Our findings reveled that the UAFT treatment could precisely reduce TP's molecular weight, with the levels decreased from 8.191 x 104 Da to 0.957 x 104 Da. Meanwhile, the MATT treatment could precisely reduce TP's esterification degree, with the values decreased from 28.04 % to 4.72 %. Nevertheless, both UAFT and MATT treatments had limited effects on the backbone and branched chain of TP. Moreover, our findings unveiled that the UAFT treatment could notably promote TP's antioxidant, antiglycation, and immunostimulatory effects, while remarkedly reduce TP's anti-hyperlipidemic effect, which were probably owing to that the UAFT treatment obviously reduced TP's molecular weight. Additionally, the MATT treatment could also promote TP's immunostimulatory effect, which was probably attributed to that the MATT treatment significantly decreased TP's esterification degree. Interestingly, the MATT treatment could regulate TP's antioxidant and antiglycation effects, which was probably attributed to that the MATT treatment simultaneously reduced its esterification degree and bound phenolics. Our findings are conducive to understanding TP's structure-activity relationship, and can afford a scientific theoretical basis for the development of functional or healthy products based on TPs. Besides, the UAFT treatment can be a promising approach for the modification of TP to improve its biological functions.

AB The hemocytes is the central part of the Eriocheir sinensis innate immune system, however, their subclasses have not been completely defined and the single-cell gene transcriptional profiles and functions are still unknown. In the present study, the single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was carried out to build a single-cell gene expression map of E. sinensis hemocytes and further analysis of the interaction molecular mechanism between the crab and novel aquatic pathogens Spiroplasma eriocheiris. By scRNA-seq, we successfully identified nine cell clusters (Hem1-9) and predicted their functions according to the specific marker genes. Pseudotime inference analysis revealed that all the identified cells undergo three stages, state 1 (the initial point), state 2 and state 3 (the other two branches). After being infected by S. eriocheiris, lots of different expression genes (DEGs) were identified in each cell cluster compared with the control group (with fold change >= 2 and p-value <0.05). The bioinformatics analysis found that the Hem1 and Hem5 were the main cell clusters synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for help the host against the pathogen infection. The Hem5 also could activate the proPO system to participate in the process of host eliminate the invading S. eriocheiris. Hem7, Hem8, and Hem9 were mainly responsible for killing the invading pathogen through phagocytosis. In particular, there were also many immune-related genes identified, including beta-glucan binding protein (BGBP), Clip-domain serine proteases (CLIPs), phenoloxidase 1 (PO1), anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs), syndecan, and lysozyme C, which not only played critical roles in the crab immune system but also could serve as the marker genes for identifying cell subgroup. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study could provide pivotal insights into the crab hemocytes cell-type-specific molecular mechanisms response S. eriocheiris infection at a single-cell level.

ID FIREPLACE
AB Indoor air quality (IAQ) has a significant impact on human health, as people spend 90% of their time in various indoor environments. Therefore, research on IAQ is extremely necessary. However, current research on traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan mainly focuses on the indoor thermal environment and heritage protection, with relatively little attention paid to IAQ. This study investigates the IAQ of traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan, which have open fire pits as the core of daily life, exploring the impact of passive renovation strategies on the indoor air quality. Using simulation methods, this study employs passive strategies, such as increasing the size of windward windows, changing ventilation methods, relocating the fire pit, and enlarging interior partition openings, to improve and optimize the IAQ through natural ventilation. The results show that when the windward window sizes are 0.8 m x 1.9 m and 0.7 m x 1.55 m, the reduction in the indoor CO2 concentration is the greatest, with a maximum decrease of 0.024% at the 1.5 m plane. This paper proposes passive renovation strategies to improve the indoor air quality of Qiang residences in western Sichuan. These strategies effectively enhance the indoor air quality of Qiang residences and address the research gap on indoor air quality in regional Qiang residences in western Sichuan. The insights and methods presented contribute to the improvement of the indoor air quality in traditional buildings and support the sustainable development of traditional architecture.

TI Dual path features interaction network for efficient image

DT Article

AB Image super-resolution (SR) is a crucial task in computer vision that involves reconstructing a low-resolution (LR) image into its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Transformer-based methods excel at establishing longrange dependency but face challenges with high-complexity computations and capturing fine-grained features. Conversely, CNN-based methods are advantageous in capturing fine-grained features but are limited by fixed receptive fields. Additionally, most SR methods suffer from channel redundancy, leading to higher computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Dual Path Features Interaction Network (DPFINet) to achieve efficient image SR, which consists of two components: a) To alleviate the issue of feature channel redundancy, a Local-Global Features Modeling (LGFM) method is newly proposed, which concurrently models global and local features by splitting features along different channels. In LGFM, a Shift Window Linear Attention (SWLA) layer is adopted to effectively capture global information through a large shift window based on the split features. Meanwhile, a Multi-Scale Detail Enhancement (MSDE) layer is designed, where the split other features are encoded to facilitate detail reconstruction through an interactive fusion of semantic and local information, thereby addressing the limitations of SWLA in capturing fine-grained features. b) A Cross- Level Features Interaction (CLFI) method is proposed to fuse global and local features modeled by different network structures (SWLA and MSDE), where a novel residual fusion mechanism is designed to preserve both global and local information while complementing each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art SR methods on five benchmark datasets. Notably, during inference, our approach improves performance by 0.41 dB and reduces memory consumption by approximately 79% compared to DiVANet (Behjati et al., 2023) on the Manga109 (x4) x 4) dataset.

AB Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe clinical condition in the intensive care units, and obesity is a high risk of ALI. Paradoxically, obese ALI patients had better prognosis than non-obese patients, and the mechanism remains largely unknown. Methods: Mouse models of ALI and diet-induced-obesity (DIO) were used to investigate the effect of exosomes derived from adipose tissue. The adipose-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and the role of exosomal miRNAs in the ALI was studied. Results: Compared with ADEs of control mice (C-Exo), ADEs of DIO mice (D-Exo) increased survival rate and mitigated pulmonary lesions of ALI mice. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the target genes of 40 differentially expressed miRNAs between D-Exo and C-Exo were mainly involved with inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle. Furthermore, the D-Exo treatment significantly decreased Ly6G + cell infiltration, down-regulated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF- alpha, MCP-1) and chemokines (IL-8 and MIP-2), reduced pulmonary apoptosis and arrest at G 0 G 1 phase ( P < 0.01). And the protective effects of D-Exo were better than those of C-Exo ( P < 0.05). Compared with the C-Exo mice, the levels of miR-16-5p and miR-335-3p in the D-Exo mice were significantly up-regulated ( P < 0.05), and the expressions of IKBKB and TNFSF10, respective target of miR-16-5p and miR-335-3p by bioinformatic analysis, were significantly down-regulated in the D-Exo mice ( P < 0.05). Conclusions: Exosomes derived from adipose tissue of DIO mice are potent to attenuate LPS-induced ALI, which could be contributed by exosome-carried miRNAs. Our data shed light on the interaction between obesity and ALI.

AB Due to their unique microstructure and modifiable rheological properties, wormlike micelles that respond to environmental stimulation have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, CO2-responsive wormlike micelles have the advantages of simple preparation and controllable properties, which have significant development potential in the food chemistry field of thickeners. In this study, CO2-responsive wormlike micelles were prepared using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), pyridoxamine (PA), and glucosamine (GA); the stimulus-responsive behaviors and mechanisms of the two systems, namely, NaDHA/PA and NaDHA/GA, were investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). The nearly unaltered viscosity of the systems confirmed the cyclic reversibility of the CO2 response of the two systems when the two mixed solutions were converted back to aqueous liquids 10 times. The preparation and properties of DHA-based CO2-responsive wormlike micelles are expected to advance fundamental research and establish the theoretical groundwork for their practical application in controllable thickening agents in food chemistry.

AB A PdCl 2 (dppf) 2 /MePhos catalyzed synthesis of 2-alkynylbenzo[b]furanes/benzo[b]thiophenes by the crosscoupling of benzo[b]furan/benzo[b]thiophene aluminums with gem-dibromoviny derivatives at 80 degrees C in DMF solvent was developed. The aryls bearing electron-donating or-withdrawing groups in gem-dibromoviny derivatives give the corresponding coupling products 2-alkynylbenzo[b]furanes/benzo[b]thiophenes in moderate to good isolated yields up to 74 %. For electrically neutral, electron rich or electron deficient benzo[b]furanyl/ benzo[b]thiophene aluminum reagents, corresponding 2-alkynylbenzo[b]furane/benzo[b]thiophene compounds can also be obtained with moderate to good isolated yields. This process was simple and easily performed, which provides an efficient method for the synthesis of 2-alkynyl benzo[b]furane/benzo[b]thiophene derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

DE X-band circulator-isolator; high peak power; cascade connected; thermal
   analysis
AB This paper presents a design of a X-band circulator-isolator for handling high-peak-power applications. The device consists of two cascade-connected ferrite circulators, with one dedicated to transmission and the other to small-signal reception coupled with high-power signal isolation. To improve the power capacity, a layer of poly-tetra fluoroethylene (PTFE) film is placed above and below the circulator's and the isolator's center conductors. Measurement results show that the device is capable of withstanding a peak power of 7000 W, with an insertion loss of <0.3 dB at the transmitting port. Similarly, it sustains a peak power of 6000 W with an insertion loss of <0.5 dB at the reception port. Moreover, the proposed design achieved isolation between the transmitting and receiving ends of >20 dB with a VSWR < 1.2 at each port. Thermal analysis shows that the maximum relative ambient temperature rise is 15.11 degree celsius. These findings show that the proposed device achieves low-loss transmission of high-peak-power signals in the transmit channel and reverse isolation of high-peak-power signals in the receive channel.

AB The distribution of species is not random in space. At the finest-resolution spatial scale, that is, field sampling locations, distributional aggregation level of different species would be determined by various factors, for example spatial autocorrelation or environmental filtering. However, few studies have quantitatively measured the importance of these factors. In this study, inspired by the statistical properties of a Markov transition model, we propose a novel additive framework to partition local multispecies distributional aggregation levels for sequential sampling-derived field biodiversity data. The framework partitions the spatial distributional aggregation of different species into two independent components: regional abundance variability and the local spatial inertia effect. Empirical studies from field amphibian surveys through line-transect sampling in southwestern China (Minya Konka) and central-southern Vietnam showed that local spatial inertia was always the dominant mechanism structuring the local occurrence and distributional aggregation of amphibians in the two regions with a latitudinal gradient from 1200 to nearly 4000 m. However, regional abundance variability is still nonnegligible in highly diverse tropical regions (i.e. Vietnam) where the altitude is not higher than 2000 m. In summary, we propose a novel framework that shows that the multispecies distributional aggregation level can be structured by two additive components. The two partitioned components could be theoretically independent. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the local community structure from the perspective of both spatial distribution and regional diversity patterns. The partitioning framework might have potential applications in field ecology and macroecology research.
   Innovative study proposes an additive partitioning framework for multispecies distributional aggregation, integrating regional abundance variability and local spatial inertia. Empirical validation conducted in southwestern China and central-southern Vietnam. Offers valuable insights for ecologists.image

ID RESEARCH PROGRESS
AB Rationale: Childhood precocious puberty (CPP) is a common pediatric endocrine disorder with significant associated risks. Zhibai Dihuang pill (ZBDHP), a classic recipe of the Qing dynasty with its efficacy of nourishing yin and clearing heat, can downregulate the expression of ESR1 in the uterus and ovaries, thereby inhibiting CPP. However, as of now, the main active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of ZBDHP remain unclear.
   Methods: A comprehensive approach was proposed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS) and network pharmacology to explore the potentially active constituents of ZBDHP and reveal the underlying mechanisms against CPP. Molecular docking was used to verify the possible mechanisms.
   Results: A total of 214 constituents derived were identified via UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS, and 12 of them were definitely characterized using reference standards. Subsequently, compounds tetrahydropalmatine, alisol C, 25-anhydroalisol A 11-acetate, hispidone, cavidine, alisol E, melianone, neogitogenin, denudatin B, and 16 beta-hydroperoxyalisol B with related targets PIK3CA, HSD11B1, CYP19A1, AR, PTGS2, CDK2, NR3C1, MMP2, MMP1, and MAPK1 were regarded as key components and targets for ZBDHP treating CPP using the compound-target-pathway network. Besides, the results revealed that the pathways conduced obviously to therapeutic efficacy, including pathways in cancer, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Molecular docking indicated that PIK3CA, HSD11B1, and CYP19A1 exhibited high affinities to corresponding compounds. Overall, the study determined the multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway mechanisms of ZBDHP against CPP.
   Conclusions: This study provided a new method for exploring the chemical constituents and pharmacology mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine.

AB Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua (PCH), as an important economic crop, is used as raw industrial materials and traditional Chinese medicine. There are significant variations in the quality of PCH from different geographical origins. It can be due to the change of the endophytic fungi and soil microbial communities of PCH. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the composition and functional prediction of the main microbial communities in the rhizomes and soil of PCH and explore their impact on medicinal quality. High-throughput sequencing techniques targeting ITS and 16S rDNA were employed to compare the structure and biodiversity differences of endophytic fungi in the rhizomes and soil microbial communities of PCH from 12 different locations in Sichuan and Guangxi province. Heatmap analysis was used for comprehensive statistics and visualization of the richness of rhizome and soil microbial communities from all locations. Venn analysis was conducted to determine the total number of shared fungi between rhizomes and soil, and GraphPad Prism analysis was employed to predict and compare the microbial communities related to phenotypes at the genus level in Sichuan and Guangxi. Tax4Fun and Fungild were used for metabolic function prediction of microbial communities in the rhizomes and soil of PCH. The results revealed the identification of 19,387 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in the rhizomes and 37,990 bacterial ASVs in the soil, with 6,889 shared bacterial ASVs. In addition, 2,948 fungal ASVs were identified in the rhizomes and 8,868 in the soil, with 1,893 shared fungal ASVs. Microbial sequencing results indicated that the fungal communities between soil and rhizomes were mainly composed of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, while bacterial communities included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidota, Gammatimonadota, and Firmicutes. Dominant bacterial groups such as Nitrospira, Acidibacter, and fungal groups including Mortierella, Ceratobasidium, and Fusarium were identified as potential contributors to the observed traits. In the top 15 microbial genera, both Sichuan and Guangxi contain 15 bacterial genera, but there are differences in their abundance. Guangxi has three unique fungal genera, including the genera Scleroderma, Russula, and Gliocladiopsis. On the other hand, Sichuan has the unique fungal genus Chamaeota. The correlation analysis between the microbiota and the chemical content from 12 different collecting spots was performed by GraphPad Prism. Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Acidibacter, and Amycolatopsis show an inverse proportionality to total polysaccharides and saponins, while Enterobacter shows a direct proportionality to total polysaccharides and inverse proportionality to saponins. The metabolism pathways show a significant positive correlation with PCH polysaccharides and saponins. This study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the quality differences between the two major indigenous areas.

AB Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are a type of pluripotent cell with unique characteristics such as non-tumorigenic and pluripotent differentiation ability. After homing, Muse cells spontaneously differentiate into tissue component cells and supplement damaged/lost cells to participate in tissue repair. Importantly, Muse cells can survive in injured tissue for an extended period, stabilizing and promoting tissue repair. In addition, it has been confirmed that injection of exogenous Muse cells exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, anti-fibrosis, immunomodulatory, and paracrine protective effects in vivo. The discovery of Muse cells is an important breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine. The article provides a comprehensive review of the characteristics, sources, and potential mechanisms of Muse cells for tissue repair and regeneration. This review serves as a foundation for the further utilization of Muse cells as a key clinical tool in regenerative medicine.

AB The major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and severe mental disorder. To identify a reliable biomarker for MDD is important for early diagnosis and prevention. Given easy access and high reproducibility, the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an ideal method to identify the biomarker for depression. In this study, sMRI data of first episode, treatment-na & iuml;ve 66 MDD patients and 54 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC) were used to identify the differences in gray matter volume (GMV), group-level, individual-level covariance connections. Finally, the abnormal GMV and individual covariance connections were applied to classify MDD from HC. MDD patients showed higher GMV in middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and precuneus (PCun), and higher structural covariance connections between MOG and PCun. In addition, the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) was applied and revealed the genetic basis for the changes of gray matter volume. Importantly, we reported that GMV in MOG, PCun and structural covariance connectivity between MOG and PCun are able to discriminate MDD from HC. Our results revealed structural underpinnings for MDD, which may contribute towards early discriminating for depression.

AB Addressing the global warming challenge, the carbon emissions reduction potential of green building (GB) is garnering increasing attention. However, the extent to which GB can impact the eco-economic efficiency (EE) of the construction industry remains unclear. To fill this gap, based on panel data for 30 regions of China from 2003 to 2018, in this study, a comprehensive analysis of the EE and sustainable impact of GB is conducted using a super slacks-based measure (SBM-DEA), panel vector autoregression (PVAR) and threshold models. The findings reflect that only about 10% of provinces have achieved EE effectiveness, with pure technical effectiveness being a significant driving force behind this. The average comprehensive, pure technical, and scale EE show a 62.23%, 46.42%, and 31.91% improvement potential regarding the efficiency frontier. The EE in the Eastern Region is relatively high, while the Western Region surpassed the Central Region in regards to EE in the areas of scale and pure technical efficiency. EE is significantly reduced in the current period (year) when it is subject to the positive impact of a standard deviation from the existing economic level. This impact was the strongest in period 1, then gradually disappeared until period 6, aligning with the Kuznets curve's theoretical assumption. GB awareness negatively impacted the current period, but is expected to gradually show a positive effect after period 2. The urbanization, green building awareness, and green building coverage make a very small contribution to the EE, accounting for 8.6%, 1.6%, and 9%, respectively, with early EE and economic level identified as the primary variables affecting the current EE. The impact of GB on EE exhibits a threshold effect, with the ecological effect of GB significant only in cities with economic levels higher than 11.063. This research contributes to the existing knowledge of the eco-economic mechanism of GB and provides insights for government policies, promoting the sustainable development of the GB market.

TI A randomized encryption deduplication method against frequency attack
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS

DE Encrypted deduplication; Cloud storage; Frequency analysis
ID SIGNATURE
AB Encryption deduplication technology first encrypts the file or chunks of data, then detects and removes duplicate ciphertexts, storing only one copy on the cloud storage server (CSP). Although traditional encryption deduplication schemes have the function of ciphertext deduplication, they also have a serious problem. Since the key generation algorithm and the encryption algorithm are deterministic, the frequency of plaintext chunking will be leaked. It is possible for the attacker to infer the information of the plaintext. We propose a Randomized Encryption deduplication method against Frequency Attack (REFA) that provides high randomness in ciphertexts. The core idea of REFA is that after obtaining a convergence key generated with the aid of a key server, the user randomizes the convergence key with a random value of the same length. Then, REFA encrypts the plaintext chunk with a randomized key. Our scheme hides the random value in the ciphertext and encrypts the convergence key for user ownership verification. REFA perfectly masks the frequency of plaintext chunks and has high storage efficiency and data security. Furthermore, the CSP performs ciphertext updates with ciphertexts uploaded by subsequent users. REFA can effectively protect against frequency analysis attacks.

AB Background: Non-coding RNA is a key epigenetic regulation factor during skeletal muscle development and postnatal growth, and miR-542-3p was reported to be conserved and highly expressed in the skeletal muscle among different species. However, its exact functions in the proliferation of muscle stem cells and myogenesis remain to be determined. Methods: Transfection of proliferative and differentiated C2C12 cells used miR-542-3p mimic and inhibitor. RT-qPCR, EdU staining, immunofluorescence staining, cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), and Western blot were used to evaluate the proliferation and myogenic differentiation caused by miR-542-3p. The dual luciferase reporter analysis and rescued experiment of the target gene were used to reveal the molecular mechanism. Results: The data shows overexpression of miR-542-3p downregulation of mRNA and protein levels of proliferation marker genes, reduction of EdU(+) cells, and cellular vitality. Additionally, knocking it down promoted the aforementioned phenotypes. For differentiation, the miR-542-3p gain-of-function reduced both mRNA and protein levels of myogenic genes, including MYOG, MYOD1, et al. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining immunized by MYHC antibody showed that the myotube number, fluorescence intensity, differentiation index, and myotube fusion index all decreased in the miR-542-3p mimic group, compared with the control group. Conversely, these phenotypes exhibited an increased trend in the miR-542-3p inhibitor group. Mechanistically, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was identified as the bona fide target gene of miR-542-3p by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, si-Pten combined with miR-542-3p inhibitor treatments totally rescued the promotion of proliferation by loss-function of miR-542-3p. Conclusions: This study indicates that miR-542-3p inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of myoblast and Pten is a dependent target gene of miR-542-3p in myoblast proliferation, but not in differentiation.

AB Pea Albumin 1, subunit b (PA1b) is a 37 amino acid peptide. It was extracted from pea seeds and showed significant insecticidal activity against certain insects, such as the mosquitoes Culex pipiens and Aedes aegyptii, cereal weevils (genus Sitophilus), and certain species of aphids. Considering that pea seeds are regularly consumed by humans and mammals, PA1b is assumed to be a promising bioinsecticide with no allergenicity or toxicity to hosts. To clarify this aspect, PA1b was applied to bovine mammary epithelial cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results revealed that LPS induced inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 6 (IL6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) secretion, while PA1b depressed these cytokines release via inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling activation. In addition, PA1b protected mammary epithelial cells from impairment caused by LPS, because it reduced cell membrane permeability and subsequently reconstructed mammary epithelial cell viability. Moreover, it inhibited cell apoptosis accompanied with alleviated oxidative stress. Furthermore, PA1b prevented opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, in turn upregulated mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production. Therefore, PA1b improved mitochondrial function, which contributed to re-construction of mammary epithelial cell viability. In conclusion, PA1b alleviates LPS-induced inflammation of bovine mammary epithelial cells via inhibiting NF-kappa B signaling activation and protects bovine mammary epithelial cells by improving mitochondrial function. PA1b is a good therapeutic survival factor for mammary epithelial cells.

AB In this study, we characterized the effects of CT dietary inclusion at 2% (wt/wt) dry matter on the goat rumen metabolome and fermentation characteristics. Barley (BA) and corn (CN) were separately used as basal grain for the control rations, and rations supplemented with CT were BACT and CNCT, respectively. The rations were tested using eight Japanese Shiba x Saanen goats in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square arrangement (28 days for each period). Ruminal fluid was obtained on day 25 of each period, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis was performed. Metabolites from BACT against BA and CNCT against CN were mostly associated with purine metabolism. Moreover, BACT against BA showed intensified biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and CNCT against CN resulted in strengthened amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, strong correlations were observed between rumen NH3-N and the copy number of total bacteria with most of the differential metabolites. The present paper provides a better understanding of the relationship between the rumen metabolome and fermentation characteristics and supports a shift in concern about using CT as a strategy to manipulate rumen metabolism.

DE Digital supply chain; multi-agent; evolutionary game; system dynamics
ID BLOCKCHAIN; MODEL; INVESTMENT; INNOVATION; IMPACT
AB This paper primarily focuses on whether supply chains enterprises adopt a digital strategy and the impact of various government measures on supply chain digital decision-making. The study develops a multi-agent decision-making evolutionary game model to examine the stability of decision-making among the government, suppliers, and manufacturers. Additionally, a system dynamics model is established to analyze the governing dynamics within the supply chain's digital decision-making process, identifying characteristic patterns and trends. The analytical results of this study illustrate the government's strength thresholds exist regardless of ex-part penalties or the mix of rewards and punishment. Once the government's strength exceeds these thresholds, the evolutionary game system undergoes abrupt changes. Suppliers and manufacturers who adopt digital strategies are more affected by government penalties than incentives. The stronger the mix of government incentives and penalties, the higher the incentives for the supplier and the manufacturer to adopt a digital strategy, but the lower the incentives for the government to choose a regulatory strategy. Low-intensity mixed rewards and punishments, as well as low-intensity government rewards, are effective mechanisms for promoting government decision-making and supervision. Conversely, high government penalties do not motivate governments to choose regulatory strategies. The unit cost of products to deploy digital strategies directly affects the final digital strategy choice of supply chain enterprises. To choose a digital strategy, supply chain companies must ensure that the unit cost of products remains within a reasonable range.

AB Microchannel demulsification is an emerging separation process for the efficient disposal of oily wastewater and oil phase recovery. Currently, this technology focuses on improving the single-pass demulsification efficiency with a short residence time. In this study, a hydrophobic/hydrophilic slots pattern was fabricated on a microchannel bottom wall to improve the single-pass demulsification efficiency through microfluidic field disturbance. The effects of the wall wettability and pattern size on the demulsification performance were studied. The adsorption, coalescence, and desorption of the oil droplets flowing through the patterned walls, and resulting microfluidic disturbances were analyzed by numerical simulation. The optimized microchannel had an enhanced single-pass demulsification efficiency of 40 % within a residence time of 0.25 s. The demulsification efficiency of the slots patterned plate-type microchannel wall was affected by the flow velocity, microchannel height, pattern size, and wettability. Therefore, this work elucidates on microchannel demulsification mechanisms, thereby providing new ideas for enhanced performance.

AB In this study, the convergence theorem of the quantum dynamic framework (QDF) is given and the convergence of QDF is proved by the imaginary time evolution method in theoretical physics. Convergence analysis has shown that the convergence of QDF is a fast and then slow process; the convergence rate mainly depends on the difference between the optimal solution and the sub-optimal solution. The experimental results verify the theoretical conclusion. This study indicates that quantum dynamics may become a new theoretical paradigm for the study of optimization algorithms and promote the study of the universality theory of optimization algorithms.

AB Objectives Ensuring that children receive timely vaccinations is paramount for preventing infectious diseases, and parental attitude plays a pivotal role in this process. This study addresses this gap in the existing literature by examining parental attitudes towards vaccinating their children. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods An online survey including parents' sociodemographic characteristics, risk perception and attitudes towards child vaccination towards COVID-19 was conducted. The modified large-scale group decision-making approach for practicality and binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors influencing parents' decision-making. Results Of the 1292 parents participated, 957 (74.1%) were willing to vaccinate their children, while 335 (25.9%) refused the vaccination. The study indicated that age, parental anxiety regarding child vaccination, concerns about the child's susceptibility to the disease, opinions towards vaccination benefits versus disadvantages, place of residence, average family income and children's health were significant predictors (p<0.05). Conclusions While most parents supported childhood vaccination, some opposed it. Addressing persistent barriers is crucial to ensure widespread vaccination and child well-being.

AB In diploid mammals, allele-specific three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture may lead to imbalanced gene expression. Through ultradeep in situ Hi-C sequencing of three representative somatic tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and brain) from hybrid pigs generated by reciprocal crosses of phenotypically and physiologically divergent Berkshire and Tibetan pigs, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization between homologous chromosomes across multiple scales. Haplotype-based interrogation of multi-omic data revealed the tissue dependence of 3D chromatin conformation, suggesting that parent-of-origin-specific conformation may drive gene imprinting. We quantify the effects of genetic variations and histone modifications on allelic differences of long-range promoter-enhancer contacts, which likely contribute to the phenotypic differences between the parental pig breeds. We also observe the fine structure of somatically paired homologous chromosomes in the pig genome, which has a functional implication genome-wide. This work illustrates how allele-specific chromatin architecture facilitates concomitant shifts in allele-biased gene expression, as well as the possible consequential phenotypic changes in mammals.

AB This study aims to investigate the effect of methionine analogue 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid isopropyl ester (HMBi) on the rumen microbial community, microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), and protein metabolism pathways in yak. Twenty-four male Maiwa yaks (252.79 +/- 15.95 kg) were selected and randomly divided into groups that received the basal diet alone, or a diet supplemented with different amounts of HMBi (5 g, 10 g or 15 g). At the phylum level, the group receiving 5 g of HMBi showed a considerably higher relative abundance of Lentisphaerae than the other treatment groups (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased linearly with the increase in HMBi supplemental levels (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella increased linearly with the increasing level of HMBi supplementation (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Butyrivibrio linearly decreased (p < 0.05), and the relative abundance of Alistipes tended to linearly decrease (p = 0.084). The addition of HMBi had linear or quadratic effects on the relative abundance of CAZy enzymes and functional proteins in the rumen of yak (p < 0.05). Conclusively, these results indicated that feeding yaks a diet supplemented with HMBi is an excellent strategy to enhance carbohydrate breakdown, and improve rumen microbial structure and function.

TI circUBE3C modulates myoblast development by binding to miR-191 and

AB Noncoding RNAs, including miRNAs (microRNAs) and circRNAs (circular RNA), are crucial regulators of myoblast proliferation and differentiation during muscle development. However, the specific roles and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in muscle development remain poorly understood. Based on the existing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, our study focuses on circUBE3C, exploring its differential expression in fetal and adult muscle tissue of the cattle and investigating its impact on myoblast proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. The functional analysis of overexpression plasmids and siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) targeting circUBE3C was comprehensively evaluated by employing an array of advanced assays, encompassing CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8), EdU (5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine), flow cytometry, western blot analysis, and RT-qPCR. In vivo investigations indicated that overexpression of circUBE3C impedes the process of skeletal muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circUBE3C interacts with miR-191 and alleviates the suppression of p27 through cytoplasmic separation, bioinformatics prediction, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation). Our findings indicate that the novel circRNA circUBE3C competitively binds to miR-191, thereby inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis in bovine primary myoblasts and unveiling a regulatory pathway in bovine skeletal muscle development. These findings expand our understanding of circRNA functions in mammals and provide a basis for further exploration of their role in myogenesis and muscle diseases.

AB Cholesterol is regarded as a signaling molecule in regulating the metabolism and function of fat cells, in which 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol, however, the exact function of DHCR7 in goat adipocytes remains unknown. Here, the effect of DHCR7 on the formation of subcutaneous and intramuscular fat in goats was investigated in vitro, and the result indicated that the mRNA level of DHCR7 showed a gradual downward trend in subcutaneous adipogenesis, but an opposite trend in intramuscular adipogenesis. In the process of subcutaneous preadipocytes differentiation, overexpression of DHCR7 inhibited the expression of adipocytes differentiation marker genes (CEBP/alpha, CEBP/beta, SREBP1 and AP2), lipid metabolism-related genes (AGPAT6, FASN, SCD1 and LPL), and the lipid accumulation. However, in intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation, DHCR7 overexpression showed a promoting effect on adipocyte differentiation marker genes (CEBP/alpha, CEBP/beta, PPAR gamma and SREBP1) and lipid metabolism-related genes (GPAM, AGPAT6, DGAT1 and SCD1) expression, and on lipid accumulation. In summary, our work demonstrated that DHCR7 played an important role in regulating adipogenic differentiation and lipid metabolism in preadipocytes in goats, which is of great significance for uncovering the underlying molecular mechanism of adipocyte differentiation and improving goat meat quality.

AB Gallium ion (Ga+) beam damage induced indium (In) precipitation in indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)/indium aluminium arsenide (InAlAs) multiple quantum wells and its corresponding evolution under electron beam irradiation was investigated by valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS) and high-angle annular dark-field imaging (HAADF) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Compared with argon ion milling for sample preparation, the heavier projectiles of Ga+ ions pose a risk to trigger In formation in the form of tiny metallic In clusters. These are shown to be sensitive to electron irradiation and can increase in number and size under the electron beam, deteriorating the structure. Our finding reveals the potential risk of formation of In clusters during focused ion beam (FIB) preparation of InGaAs/InAlAs quantum well samples and their subsequent growth under STEM-HAADF imaging, where initially invisible In clusters of a few atoms can move and swell during electron beam exposure.Lay description: In this paper, the evolution of Ga+ implantation induced In precipitation in InGaAs/InAlAs multiple quantum wells under electron beam irradiation was investigated by valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELs), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXs) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging technique based in a probe aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. In contrast to Ar+ ion bombardment, the projectile of focused Ga+ ions is able to trigger the clustering of In interstitials in InGaAs/InAlAs multiple quantum wells, which allows the formation of metallic In precipitates. Afterwards, by exploiting an extensive electron beam rastering on the region of In precipitation, the increase of electron irradiation time could lead to a pronounced swelling of In cluster size. Especially for the region contains In precipitates of several atoms, where the morphology of In cluster is invisible in atomic image. The continuous electron irradiation could give rise to the promotion of In clustering, allowing the structure of In precipitates been resolved by HAADF image. Our finding reveals the potential risk of formation of In precipitates during focused Ga+ ion beam bombarded InGaAs/InAlAs semiconductors and the subsequent evolution of In clustering under electron beam rastering. These findings emphasise the need for caution when studying FIB prepared In-based III-V quantum well specimens using TEM even in the In(Ga,Al)As system, as the initially formed In-rich clusters are so small they can remain invisible for some time.

AB Millettia speciosa Champ. (MSCP), which is distributed and used in Southern China, is often sulfur-fumigated during postharvest handling to prevent insects and molds. In the present study, a comprehensive strategy was proposed by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) with multivariate analysis to rapidly identify potential chemical sulfur-fumigated MSCP (SF-MSCP) samples, discover chemical transformation mechanisms and control the quality of SF-MSCP. Eighty-six compounds were tentatively assigned, and ten compounds were screened out as potential markers. Moreover, the chemical transformation mechanism was deduced by hydrolysis, esterification and dehydration reactions that occurred during the sulfur-fumigated process. The developed method was successfully applied to predict 16 commercial MSCP samples, and 9 samples were found to contain sulfur compounds, ranging in sulfur residues from 100 to 310 mg/kg. These research outcomes can not only be used to distinguish the nonfumigated MSCP from SF-MSCP by chemical markers but also provide a chemical basis for further comprehensive investigating in-depth safety and functional evaluations of SF-MSCP.

AB Electrocatalytic CO2 conversion promises a sustainable alternative to producing CO2-based green chemicals and fuels concomitant with the storage of fluctuating renewable energy. Herein, isolated Ni single-atom catalysts supported by nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (Ni-SACs/NHPC) were designed with large specific surface area (1115.6 m(2) g(-1)) and abundant micropore structures. The synthesized Ni-SACs/NHPC demonstrated excellent activity (CO faradaic efficiency, FECO > 90%) for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction with a broad reaction potential window from -0.74 to -1.24 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), while flow cell design increased the current density while maintaining high CO faradaic efficiency. Additionally, non-thermal Ar-plasma was used to enhance the adhesion at the electrocatalyst-substrate interface, resulting in a significantly high CO partial current density (16.8 mA cm(-2)) achieved at -1.04 V vs. RHE with CO faradaic efficiency of similar to 96%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the highly dispersed single-atom Ni could effectively weaken the Ni-C bond energy and avoid the excessive accumulation of *CO to promote electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion.

AB Insurance plays an important role in building rural livelihood resilience, in the context of climate change. Existing research examines the factors influencing insurance uptake and the effects of insurance adoption on informal risk-sharing strategies. This study, however, argues that insurance is an external policy intervention being introduced into a diversity of rural community adaptation strategies that are crucial components of resilient livelihood development. In this context, this study focuses on the case of subsidized livestock insurance in Tibetan pastoral regions with pooled cross-sectional data spanning three distinct time periods to explore how formal subsidized livestock insurance interacts with the diversity of adaptation strategies. Our findings first revealed a rising trend in subsidized livestock insurance adoption, accompanied by increased utilization of various on-pastoralism strategies, including custom-based and market-based approaches, and off-pastoralism strategies, such as increasing income sources. Second, our studies found a significant positive correlation between livestock insurance and the diversity index of market-based and off-pastoralism adaptation strategies, indicating a more complementary relationship. In addition, our studies discovered that the introduction of livestock insurance does not have an obvious correlation with custom-based strategies, dismissing the concerns of the potential displacement of informal custom-based adaptation strategies by subsidized livestock insurance. These results highlight that the subsidized livestock insurance policy is among many other adaptation strategies that rural communities have applied to respond to climate changes and build resilient livelihoods.
   Government-subsidized livestock insurance is an effective strategy for adaptation to climate change in pastoral areas, covering the high losses of pastoralists after a weather-related disaster and helping them recover.In Tibetan pastoral regions there is a positive relationship between livestock insurance on the one hand, and a diversity of market-based and off-pastoralism adaptation strategies on the other.Livestock insurance, a government policy-driven adaptation strategy, has become part of the diverse adaptation strategies that herders have implemented to respond to climate change.

AB Simple Summary In this study, 471 microsatellite loci which are common among 8 pheasant species were screened based on genome data, and 119 loci were selected to develop microsatellite markers. After PCR amplifications and reaction condition optimizations, and validation of microsatellite loci in 14 species of 11 genera within Phasianidae. Finally, 49 potentially universal microsatellite markers in the pheasant species were obtained. The 49 potentially universal microsatellite loci were successfully applied to a genetic diversity assessment and comparison for three pheasant birds, the Sichuan Hill partridge, blood pheasant and buff-throated partridge. These 49 microsatellite loci are potentially universal microsatellite loci for pheasants and are of great significance to establish a shared platform in population genetics study of pheasants.Abstract Pheasants are widely distributed in the southwest of China, but many of them are endangered due to habitat fragmentation and environmental changes. Genetic diversity is crucial for species to maintain their evolutionary potential, and thus it is important to develop universal genetic markers for facilitating the assessment of genetic diversity and planning effective conservation actions in these endangered species. In this study, 471 microsatellite loci which are common among eight pheasant species were screened based on genome data, and 119 loci were selected to develop microsatellite markers. After PCR amplifications and reaction condition optimizations, and validation of microsatellite loci in 14 species of 11 genera within Phasianidae. Finally, 49 potentially universal microsatellite markers in pheasant species were obtained. These microsatellite markers were successfully applied to assess the genetic diversity of 3 pheasant species. The Sichuan hill partridge (Arborophila rufipectus), blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), buff-throated partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii) and Sichuan hill partridge had a relatively low genetic diversity level. These 49 microsatellite loci are potentially universal microsatellite loci for pheasants and are of great significance to establish a shared platform in population genetics study of pheasants.

TI Cloning and Characterization of Yak DHODH Gene and Its Functional

AB Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a rate-limiting enzyme of de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine. Although the involvement of DHODH in resisting ferroptosis has been successively reported in recent years, which greatly advanced the understanding of the mechanism of programmed cell death (PCD), the genetic sequence of the yak DHODH gene and its roles in ferroptosis are still unknown. For this purpose, we firstly cloned the coding region sequence of DHODH (1188 bp) from yak liver and conducted a characterization analysis of its predictive protein that consists of 395 amino acids. We found that the coding region of the yak DHODH gene presented high conservation among species. Second, the expression profile of the DHODH gene in various yak tissues was investigated using RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that DHODH was widely expressed in different yak tissues, with particularly high levels in the spleen, heart, and liver. Third, to investigate the involvement of DHODH in regulating ferroptosis in cells, yak skin fibroblasts (YSFs) were isolated from fetuses. And then, bisphenol S (BPS) was used to induce the in vitro ferroptosis model of YSFs. We observed that BPS decreased the cell viability (CCK8) and membrane potential (JC-1) of YSFs in a dose-dependent manner and induced oxidative stress by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Simultaneously, it was evident that BPS effectively augmented the indicators associated with ferroptosis (MDA and BODIPY staining) and reduced GSH levels. Importantly, the co-administration of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer), a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis, significantly alleviated the aforementioned markers, thereby confirming the successful induction of ferroptosis in YSFs by BPS. Finally, overexpression plasmids and siRNAs of the yak DHODH gene were designed and transfected respectively into BPS-cultured YSFs to modulate DHODH expression. The findings revealed that DHODH overexpression alleviated the occurrence of BPS-induced ferroptosis, while interference of DHODH intensified the ferroptosis process in YSFs. In summary, we successfully cloned the coding region of the yak DHODH gene, demonstrating its remarkable conservation across species. Moreover, using BPS-induced ferroptosis in YSFs as the model, the study confirmed the role of the DHODH gene in resisting ferroptosis in yaks. These results offer valuable theoretical foundations for future investigations into the functionality of the yak DHODH gene and the underlying mechanisms of ferroptosis in this species.

AB Alpine meadow degradation, usually involving decreased soil nitrogen (N) and patchy landscapes, is a challenge for natural restoration. However, the mechanism underlying plant species coexistence under degradation is unclear. In this study, we evaluated plant N niche complementarity in degraded alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using a 15N-labeling (15NO3, 15NH4+, and 15N-glycine) experiment. At the community level, the concentration of 15NO3 in the degraded alpine meadow was 1.5 times higher than that in the undegraded alpine meadow; both alpine meadows had a significant preference for NO3 (60.72 % and 66.84 % for the degraded and undegraded alpine meadows, respectively), and the degree of glycine preference was significantly higher in the degraded alpine meadow (30.77 %) relative to the undegraded alpine meadow (21.85 %). At the species level, dominant species in both alpine meadows consistently preferred NO3 ; the generalist species that can be found in both meadows and unique species of the two alpine meadows generally showed NO3  preferences, while the other plant species that were unevenly distributed in the degraded alpine meadow tended to show increased utilization of glycine, which could reduce N competition. We observed that differentiation among N sources and the uneven distribution of unique species may explain the stability of degraded alpine meadows. Our results suggested that uneven distributions of plants could have strong impacts on community stability and highlighted the importance of considering fine-scale analysis in studies of niche theory. This study has important implications for the restoration of degraded alpine meadows.

AB With the widespread use of distributed machine learning (DML), many IT companies have established networks dedicated to DML. Different communication architectures of DML have different traffic patterns and different requirements on network performance, which is closely related to network topology. However, traditional network topologies usually pursue general goals and are agnostic to the special communication pattern of the applications. The mismatch between network topology and the applications will directly affect the training performance. Although some studies have analyzed the effect of topology on training performance, the topologies and communication architectures involved are not comprehensive, and it is still not known which topology is appropriate for which communication architecture. This survey investigates typical topologies and analyzes whether they meet the requirements of three commonly used communication architectures (i.e., Parameter Server (PS), Tree and Ring architectures) of DML. Specifically, the topology requirements of each communication architecture and two common topology requirements (i.e., high scalability and fault tolerance) for DML are studied firstly. Next, whether these topologies meet the topology requirements is analyzed. Then, this paper discusses potential technologies and approaches to construct the appropriate scheme for each topology requirement, and then presents DMLNet, a novel network topology that suits the three communication architectures. Finally, several potential directions for future research are outlined.

And build an analysis framework based on the three dimensions of time, space, and tools. We used Nvivo.20 software for text encoding analysis.ResultsBased on the model framework, we analyze the results as follows. From the perspective of the time dimension, among the five types of policy tools, the proportion of command-type policy tools used showed a downward trend, from 88.16% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 83.50% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. However, motivation-type and persuasion-type tools showed an upward trend, rising from 1.34% and 5.26% in the 12th Five-Year Plan period to 3.40% and 8.74% in the 14th Five-Year Plan respectively. The system-change-type policy tools decreased from 1.32% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 0.97% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. The proportion of capacity-building-type policy tools has gradually increased from 2.63% in the 12th Five-Year Plan to 4.85% in the 14th Five-Year Plan. From the perspective of spatial dimension, apart from command and persuasion policy tools, the usage frequency of the other three types of policy tools in the three major regions all display a "growth-decline-growth" trend. From the perspective of tool dimension, command-type policy tools are dominant in China's community governance, with a cumulative frequency of 1405 times and a high proportion of 81.75%. Apart from command policy tools, persuasive policy tools and capacity-building policy tools have a relatively high proportion, with usage frequencies of 186 and 78 respectively.ConclusionsWe found that current community governance policy tools mainly consist of command tools. However, there is a trend towards combining tools such as command, persuasion, incentive, capacity building, and system change in the future. There is a typical contradiction between instrumental rationality and value rationality, indicating an evolution from instrumental rationality to the integration of instrumental and value rationality. This study addresses the conflict of policy tools through rational guidance of values, the rational guarantee of tools, and cooperation to achieve the goal of high-quality development of community governance.

AB Addressed in this paper is the observer -based waiting event -triggered control issue in multiarea load frequency control (LFC) power system subject to random communication delay and data packet dropout. In order to maintain the grid frequency stability of the multi-area LFC power system in an open communication network, an observer -based waiting event-triggered scheme (WETS) is proposed to deal with frequency fluctuation and extend the life of control equipments. Compared with the existing event -triggered mechanism, the proposed WETS has the merits of continuous event -triggered scheme and the periodic sampling event-triggered scheme in the both of theory and application. Then, by well considering the negative factors of data packet dropout and random time delay in data transmission, a stochastic delay -dependent multi -area LFC model is established, which involves the information of observer-based WETS, random communication delay and packet dropout in a unified structure. Further, an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed by dividing the interval of transmitted delay. Based on the constructed Lyapunov functional, Park's theorem and Jensen's integral inequality, some less conservative stabilization criteria are obtained. Finally, the validity of the proposed control method is verified via numerical examples.

AB Goat intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is precisely regulated by many key genes as well as transcription factors. Nevertheless, the potential of the regulators of goat IMF deposition remains undefined. In this work, we reported that the transcription factor FOS is expressed at a low level at the early differentiation stage and at a high level in late differentiation. The overexpression of FOS inhibited intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation and significantly downregulated the expressions of PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta, C/EBP alpha, AP2, SREBP1, FASN, ACC, HSL, and ATGL. Consistently, the knockdown of FOS, facilitated by two distinct siRNAs, significantly promoted intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation. Moreover, our analysis revealed multiple potential binding sites for FOS on the promoters of PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP alpha. The expression changes in PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP alpha during intramuscular adipogenesis were opposite to that of FOS. In summary, FOS inhibits intramuscular lipogenesis in goats and potentially negatively regulates the expressions of PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta, and C/EBP alpha genes. Our research will provide valuable data for the underlying molecular mechanism of the FOS regulation network of intramuscular lipogenesis.

AB The bamboo shoot of Pleioblastus amarus (Keng) Keng f. is a medicinal and edible resource in China. In this study, three separation techniques were applied to identify the primary and secondary metabolites component of P. amarus bamboo shoots, including sheathless capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (CESI-MS), reverse-phase liquid chromatography-MS (RPLC-MS), and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-MS (HILIC-MS). A total of 201 metabolites were identified by the three methods. Among those metabolites, 146 were identified by RPLC-MS, 85 were identified by HILIC-MS, and 46 were identified by sheathless CESI-MS. These methods were complementary and had a linear coefficient. CESI-MS presented advantages in the identification of isomers, high sensitivity, very low sample usage, and good detection of polar and nonpolar metabolites, showing its unique applications in food analysis and prospects in metabolic research.

AB All jawed vertebrates have four T cell receptor (TCR) chains expressed by thymus-derived lymphocytes that play a significant role in animal immune defense. However, avian TCR studies have been limited to a few species, although their co-functional major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) have been studied for decades, showing various copy numbers and polymorphisms. Here, using public genome data, we characterized the copy numbers, the phylogenic relationship and selection of T cell receptor complex (TCR-C) segments, and the genomic organization of TCR loci across birds. Various numbers of C segments were found in the TCR alpha/TCR delta, TCR beta, and TCR gamma loci, and phylogenetic analysis reflected both ancient gene duplication events (two C beta segments and C delta segments divergent into C delta I and C delta II) and contemporary evolution (lineage-specific and species-specific characteristics). Most passerines lack C delta II segments and a second TRD locus, except Meliphagidae and Maluridae. A relatively stable structure was verified in four TCR loci of birds, except for the arrangement of V segment groups. In this study, we explored the phylogenetic relationships of TCR-C segments across avians for the first time. We inferred gene duplication and loss events during the evolution process. The finding of diverse TCR germline repertoires provides a better understanding of the immune systems of birds.

AB Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) have attracted considerable interest due to their fascinating potential in various fields, such as sensors, color displays, anticounterfeiting, paints and inks. Herein, we presented a supramolecular liquid crystal (SLC) inverse opal composite film (SLC/PC) characterized by rapid and broad wavelength shifts in response to pH changes. This composite film was prepared based on the hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) SLCs using silica colloids as the template. The H-bonds served as a functional "switch" that could reversibly turn on (break) and off (recover) in response to changes in environmental pH or temperature. This reversible activation led to the swelling or shrinkage of the SLC layer, resulting in significant changes in lattice spacing and diffraction-wavelength shifts according to Bragg's law. Meanwhile, the structural color of the SLC/PC varied significantly, and a naked-eye monitoring of pH and temperature was realized. Moreover, the film exhibited rapid response times (less than 0.5 s), complete reversibility, and broad diffraction-wavelength shifts (up to 250 nm, nearly covering the entire visible spectrum) when exposed to pH changes. The alignment of molecules as well as the SLC structure within the film played crucial roles in achieving this high responsiveness. The film also demonstrated exceptional chemical stability and could be recycled effectively. Such a functional film, offering rapid, completely reversible, and broad wavelength shifts, along with excellent reusability and stability, holds great promise for use as a pH sensor in environmental monitoring.
   A supramolecular liquid crystal/photonic crystal (SLC/PC) inverse opal film was made using hydrogen-bonded SLC polymers and silica colloids. The SLC/PC film showed wide diffraction-wavelength shifts, quick pH response, great recyclability and high chemical stability.

TI Dynamic evolution of policy mix in response to COVID-19: Practice from
   China
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB COVID-19 is a global pandemic. In response to this unprecedented crisis, Chinese government formulated a series of policies. This research is dedicated to exploring the dynamic evolution of China's policy mix in response to COVID-19 in different crisis response stages from a network perspective. First, a three-dimensional analysis framework of "policy subject-policy target-policy instrument" was developed. Then, based on the data sets collected by textual analysis, the dynamic evolution of policy subject, policy target, policy instrument in China's policy mix in response to COVID-19 was discussed by using the method of SNA. This study concluded that the core policy subject, policy instrument, and policy target of China's response to COVID-19 changed with time. National Health Commission (NHC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MHRSS) have important influences in the network of policy subjects. Other subjects are more at the edge of the network, and there are few joint issuances among policy subjects. The study also found that the core policy target was adjusted over time, with phased dynamic characteristics. At the initial stage of China's response to COVID-19, "reduce infection and mortality" and "steadily carry out economic and social work" were the core policy targets. With the COVID-19 under control, "enterprise development and work resumption" becomes a new core policy target. In addition, this study also revealed the dynamic evolution and unbalanced use of China's policy instruments in response to COVID-19 in different stages. The combination of policy instruments is mainly composed of "mandatory administration instruments" and "economic incentive instruments", and supplemented by "health promotion instruments" and "voluntary plan instruments". These findings may enrich the literature on COVID-19 policy to help researchers understand the dynamics of policy from a network perspective. Moreover, these findings may provide several valuable implications for policymakers and other countries to formulate more effective policies for epidemic response.

AB This study aimed to examine the mediating effect of life satisfaction in the relationship between hope and internalizing/externalizing behaviors among a sample of 1170 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 14.80 +/- 1.76 years, 46.24% boys). Through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM), the study revealed a negative association between hope and internalizing/externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, the findings indicated that life satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between hope and internalizing/externalizing behaviors. The findings highlight the significance of hope and life satisfaction as protective factors in reducing internalizing/externalizing behaviors among adolescents. These results also contribute to the existing research on the role of hope and emphasize the importance of fostering hope and enhancing life satisfaction in prevention and intervention programs targeting adolescent internalizing/externalizing behaviors.

AB The continuous discovery of giant oil and gas fields in deep-water low stand fans has made deep-water submarine fan reservoirs with huge oil and gas potential important targets for oil and gas exploration and development. Nowadays, machine learning algorithm has been proven to be an effective method to classify various rock types from geophysical logging data, but rarely has there been focus on predicting deep-water submarine fans in previous studies. In this paper, we utilized five classical Boosting machine learning algorithms, namely GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and LogitBoost, to identify 14 deep-water submarine fan lithofacies types from 7 wells in a West African oilfield. To address the sample non-balance problem, we employed SMOTE and MAHAKIL oversampling techniques and optimized the hyperparameters of the model using Genetic Algorithm. The experimental results show that the model performance is improved by using oversampling technologies and hyperparameter optimization. The proposed MAHAKIL-GA-GBDT algorithm is the most effective in identifying the lithofacies of deep-water submarine fans, with an accuracy of 0.986. This study provides a new approach for identifying deep-water submarine fan lithofacies and highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms in this field.

AB Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most common food-borne poisoning microbial agent. However, the antimicrobial activity of beta-defensin 116 in yak and its application in S. aureus-induced diarrheal disease have not been reported. In this study, 303 bp cDNA sequence of yak DEFB116 gene was obtained. In addition, the prokaryotic expression vector of DEFB116 protein with a molecular weight of 16 kDa was successfully constructed and expressed. The yak DEFB116 gene can encode 19 amino acids, the percentage of hydrophobic amino acids is 36 % and the total positive charge is 6, which has potential antibacterial potential. Sufficient DEFB116 protein concentration and time can destroy the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in leakage of intracellular solutes and thus killing S. aureus. The intestinal histopathological features and the number of inflammatory cells were improved in the diarrhea mouse model under the action of DEFB116 protein. The decrease of goblet cells was reversed, the expression of mucoprotein was increased. DEFB116 protein increased the abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri and Desulfovibrio, and inhibited the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria. These findings provide new insights into the potential future applications of yak beta-defencins in the food industry and medical fields.

AB TG interaction factor 1 (TGIF1) plays a major role in transcriptional inhibition and suppression of TGF-& beta; signaling, but its functional roles in granulosa cells (GCs) have not been elucidated; in particular, there is no information about the yak (Bos grunniens) TGIF1 gene. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to clone yak TGIF1 and investigate TGIF1 functions in yak GCs. RT-PCR results showed that the coding region of yak TGIF1 is 759 bp and encodes 252 amino acids. Its nucleotide sequence showed 85.24-99.74% similarity to mouse, human, pig, goat and cattle homologous genes. To explore the functional roles of TGIF1, we studied proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, steroidogenesis and the expression levels of related genes in yak GCs transfected with small interfering RNA specific to TGIF1. The results showed that TGIF1 knockdown promoted proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibited apoptosis and estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) production in cultured yak GCs. Conversely, TGIF1 overexpression inhibited proliferation and cell cycle progression and stimulated apoptosis and E2 and P4 production. In addition, these functional changes in yak GCs were observed parallel to the expression changes in genes involved in the cell cycle (PCNA, CDK2, CCND1, CCNE1, CDK4 and P53), apoptosis (BCL2, BAX and CASPASE3), and steroidogenesis (CYP11A1, 3 & beta;-HSD and StAR). In conclusion, TGIF1 was relatively conserved in the course of animal evolution. TGIF1 inhibited GC viability and stimulated apoptosis and the secretion of E2 and P4 by yak GCs. Our results will help to reveal the mechanism underlying yak follicular development and improve the reproductive efficiency of female yaks.

AB The combination of electric heating and thermal energy storage (TES) with phase change material (PCM) can achieve load shifting for air conditioning energy saving in building sectors. Their non-flammability, relatively good mechanical properties, and low cost make inorganic PCMs attractive in construction engineering. However, PCMs often show poor thermal conductivity, low heat transfer efficiency, leakage risk, etc., in applications. Moreover, the practical thermal performance of PCM-TES sometimes fails to meet demand variations during charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, in this study, a novel integrated electric PCM wall panel module is proposed with quick dynamic thermal response in space heating suitable for both retrofitting of existing buildings and new construction. Sodium-urea PCM composites are chosen as PCM wall components for energy storage. Based on the enthalpy-porosity method, a mathematical heat transfer model is established, and numerical simulation studies on the charge-discharge characteristics of the module are conducted using ANSYS software. Preliminary results show that the melting temperature decreases from 50 & DEG;C to approximately 30 & DEG;C with a 30% urea mixing ratio, approaching the desired indoor thermal comfort zone for space heating. With declining PCM layer thickness, the melting time drops, and released heat capacity rises during the charge process. For a 20 mm thick PCM layer, 150 W/m2 can maintain the average surface temperature within a comfort range for 12.1 h, about half the time of a 24 h charge-discharge cycling periodicity. Furthermore, placing the heating film in the unit center is preferable for improving overall heat efficiency and shortening the time to reach the thermal comfort temperature range. This work can provide guidance for practical thermal design optimization of building envelopes integrated with PCM for thermal insulation and energy storage.

AB Seed yield components and ear characteristics are critical parameters for seed yield improvement of cereal crops. In this study, 23 hulled oat (Avena sativa) cultivars were planted in four experimental sites during 2018-2020. We determined the ear parameters including the number of four spikelet types, the ear length, the seed weight per ear, and the size of the left and the right seed in the double-seed spikelet. In addition, five oat cultivars with the highest percentage of the triple-seed spikelet were selected to evaluate the germination performance of the left, the middle, and the right seed. The results showed that the double-seed spikelet was present in 73% of the ear, occupying the highest proportion than other spikelet types. The negative correlation showed the trade-off between total seed number per ear and average seed weight. According to the pathway analysis, the number of double-seed spikelet had the significantly highest direct effect on the seed weight per ear with the path coefficient of 0.93. In the double-seed spikelet, the length and the thickness both had significantly positive correlations to the seed weight of the left and the right seeds. The middle seed, which had the smallest seed size, had the lowest germination rate, germination index, vigour index, seedling weight, and length than the right and left seed among three seed positions in the triple-seed spikelet. We conclude that the double-seed spikelet number is a key ear characteristic when breeding high-yielding cultivars.

AB Solved in this paper is the stabilization of uncertain local field neural networks (ULFNNs) with leakage delay by dint of a mixed impulsive control scheme. The impulsive control instants are decided by a Lyapunov functional-based event triggered scheme and a periodic impulse triggered scheme. Based on the proposed control scheme, sufficient conditions are deduced for eliminating the Zeno behavior and guaranteeing the uniform asymptotic stability (UAS) of the delayed ULFNNs in the framework of Lyapunov functional analysis method. Different from individual event triggered impulse control strategy where the triggered instants may be unexpected, the mixed impulsive control scheme can release the impulse control instants in line with the distance between any two adjacent successful control points, which improves the control performance and also achieves the goal of saving the communication resource. Furthermore, the decay behavior of impulse control signal is considered to make mathematical derivation more practical, and based on this behavior, a criterion is derived to make ensure the exponential stability of delayed ULFNNs. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed controller for the ULFNNs with leakage delay. (c) 2023 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB IntroductionDespite long-term integrated control programs for Eimeria stiedai infection in China, hepatic coccidiosis in rabbits persists. Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Th9, and Th21 cells are involved in immune responses during pathogen infection. It is unclear whether Th cell subsets are also involved in E. stiedai infection. Their roles in the immunopathology of this infection remain unknown. Therefore, monitoring these T-cell subsets' immune responses during primary infection of E. stiedai at both transcriptional (mRNA) and protein (cytokines) levels is essential. MethodsIn experimentally infected New Zealand white rabbits, mRNA expression levels of their transcript-TBX2 (Th1), GATA3 (Th2), RORC (Th17), Foxp3 (Treg), SPI1 (Th9), and BCL6 (Th21)-were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), whereas Th1 (IFN-g and TNF-a), Th2 (IL4), Th17 (IL17A and IL6), Treg (IL10 and TGF-b1), Th9 (IL9), and Th21 (IL21) cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). ResultsWe found that levels of TBX2, GATA3, RORC, SPI1, and BCL6 in the livers of infected rabbits were elevated on days 5 and 15 post-infection (PI). The concentrations of their distinctive cytokines IFN-g and TNF-a for Th1, IL4 for Th2, IL17A for Th17, IL9 for Th9, IL21 for Th21, and IL10 for Treg IL10 were also significantly increased on days 5 and 15 PI, respectively (p < 0.05). On day 23 PI, GATA3 with its cytokine IL4, RORC with IL17A, Foxp3 with IL10 and TGF-b1, and SPI1 with IL9 were significantly decreased, but TBX2 with IFN-g and IL6 remained elevated. DiscussionOur findings are the first evidence of Th1/Th2/Treg/Th17/Th9/Th21 changes in E. stiedai-infected rabbits and provide insights into immune regulation mechanisms and possible vaccine development.

AB This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence on the relationship between Chinese personality traits and mental health. Through literature search and screening, a total of 70 original articles and 72 independent samples with a total of 65,133 participants were included. The results showed that: (1) Chinese mental health was significantly correlated with three dimensions of personality: psychoticism, neuroticism, and extraversion (correlation coefficients were 0.234, 0.438, and -0.101, respectively); (2) each factor of mental health was significantly positively correlated with psychoticism and neuroticism; only the factor of interpersonal sensitivity was significantly negatively correlated with extraversion; (3) subject type has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between mental health and neuroticism and extraversion, but has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between mental health and psychoticism; (4) publication type does not play a moderating role in the relationship between mental health and the three personality dimensions. This meta-analysis confirmed that personality traits have a significant predictive effect on mental health in Chinese people. However, the relationship between personality and mental health varied considerably across dimensions and groups.

AB Introduction: As a valuable genetic resource, native birds can contribute to the sustainable development of animal production. Tibetan chickens, known for their special flavor, are one of the important local poultry breeds in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, Tibetan chickens have a slow growth rate and poor carcass traits compared with broilers. Although most of the research on Tibetan chickens focused on their hypoxic adaptation, there were fewer studies related to skeletal muscle development.Methods: Here, we performed the transcriptional sequencing of leg muscles from Tibetan chicken embryos at E (embryonic)10, E14, and E18.Results: In total, 1,600, 4,610, and 2,166 DE (differentially expressed) mRNAs, 210, 573, and 234 DE lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs), and 52, 137, and 33 DE miRNAs (microRNAs) were detected between E10 and E14, E10 and E18, and E14 and E18, respectively. Functional prediction showed several DE mRNAs and the target mRNAs of DE lncRNAs and DE miRNAs were significantly enriched in sarcomere organization, actin cytoskeleton organization, myofibril, muscle fiber development, and other terms and pathways related to muscle growth and development. Finally, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA) network associated with muscle growth and development, which contained 6 DE lncRNAs, 13 DE miRNAs, and 50 DE mRNAs, was constructed based on the screened DE RNAs by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment. These DE RNAs may play a critical regulatory role in the skeletal muscle development of chickens.Discussion: The results provide a genomic resource for mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs potentially involved in the skeletal muscle development of chickens, which lay the foundation for further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle growth and development in Tibetan chickens.

AB The large surface area and porous structure of MOF materials could provide binding sites for fluorescent moieties for bioimaging. Herein, we reported the preparation of fluorescent MOF material Zn(BDC) by 8-hydroquinoline modification [Zn(BDC)-8HQ]. Zn(BDC)-8HQ emitted strong fluorescence at 507 nm. The fluorescent Zn(BDC)8HQ had a hydrodynamic radius of 255 nm, suitable for lymph node tracing. After subcutaneous injection, a bright spot could be distinguished at the injection site. The injections to front extremities resulted in sentinel lymph node accumulations. The low toxicity of Zn(BDC)-8HQ was evidenced by serum biochemical index and histopathological observations.

AB In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the ORRmechanismof non-pyrolytic mono-1,10-phenanthroline-coordinated Cu2+ (Cu-N-2 type) complexes and polymers by molecular dynamicsand quantum mechanics calculation. In contrast to the complex-catalyzedORR, which follows a direct four-electron pathway along intermediatesof Cu(I)-Phen, the polymer-catalyzed ORR follows an indirect four-electronpathway by intermediates of Cu(II)-Phen. By analyzing the structure,spin population, electrostatic potential (ESP), and density of states,we confirmed that the higher ORR catalytic activity of the polymeris due to the conjugation effect of coplanar phenanthroline and Cu(II)in the planar reactants or at the base of the square-pyramidal intermediates.The conjugation effect allows the highest ESP to be located near theactive center Cu(II), while the lower ESPs are distributed on thephenanthroline, which is very favorable for the reduction current.This will serve as a theoretical foundation for the development ofnew highly efficient ORR non-pyrolytic CuN2 polymer catalysts.
   To explore the reasons for the higherORR catalytic activityof non-pyrolytic CuN2-type polymers than its complexes,we researched step by step the ORR process of mono-1,10-phenanthroline-coordinatedCu(2+) (Cu-N-2 type) complexes and polymers bymolecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanics calculations basedon the CHE model. Results show that the complex-catalyzed ORR followsa direct four-electron pathway along intermediates of Cu(I)-Phen whilethe polymer-catalyzed ORR follows an indirect four-electron pathwayby intermediates of Cu(II)-Phen.

AB Efficient and stable global optimizers constitute a noteworthy arena of academic study and real-world applications. Since Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm inspired by the quantum motion for solving optimization problems was proposed, considerable contributions regarding this algorithm have been achieved in recent years. Nevertheless, issues such as the aggregation effect during sampling as well as recurrence and blindness in random searches hinder the performance of the algorithm. Motivated by this situation, a variant of Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm is put forward to improve the efficiency of the system convergence while maintaining the solution diversity. The measurement of the solution position through the collapse of the quantum state to the classical state is realized by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and the energy position is established as a metric for energy observation. Then, the adaptive correction of the energy position is explored to improve algorithm performance. The core idea of our mechanism is to adaptively guide the candidate solutions toward convergence to the ground state by means of attractive factors based on the relationship among the energy positions of several reference points. Experimental results obtained on the CEC2013 benchmark functions and a real-world application indicate that the performance of our scheme is competitive and that it achieves prominence among the compared algorithms as the dimensionality increases.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Community detection is widely used in social networks to uncover groups of related vertices (nodes). In cryptocurrency transaction networks, community detection can help identify users that are most related to known illegal users. However, there are challenges in applying community detection in cryptocurrency transaction networks: (1) the use of pseudonymous addresses that are not directly linked to personal information make it difficult to interpret the detected communities; (2) on Bitcoin, a user usually owns multiple Bitcoin addresses, and nodes in transaction networks do not always represent users. Existing works on cluster analysis on Bitcoin transaction networks focus on addressing the later using different heuristics to cluster addresses that are controlled by the same user. This research focuses on illegal community detection containing one or more illegal Bitcoin addresses. We first investigate the structure of Bitcoin transaction networks and suitable community detection methods, then collect a set of illegal addresses and use them to label the detected communities. The results show that 0.06% of communities from daily transaction networks contain one or more illegal addresses when 2,313,344 illegal addresses are used to label the communities. The results also show that distance-based clustering methods and other methods depending on them, such as network representation learning, are not suitable for Bitcoin transaction networks while community quality optimization and label-propagation-based methods are the most suitable.

AB Increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, due to fertilization and deposition, is expected to influence soil microbial community structure and function. However, little is known about the sensitivity and dependency of soil microbial structure on the levels of N and P, and on the integration of N and P inputs in alpine meadow ecosystems. Here, we implemented a 3-year manipulative fertilization study with four levels (0, 10, 20, and 30 g m(-2)) of N fertilization, P fertilization, and NP fertilization (N and P fertilization at a ratio of 1:1) in a Tibetan alpine meadow. We examined how greater N and P availability affected bacterial community diversity, community structure in the top- (0-10 cm) and sub-top (10-20 cm) soil, network topological properties, and the potential mechanisms behind them. Although the & alpha; and & beta; diversities of bacteria within top- and sub-topsoil were not significantly different from those in the control across N, P, and NP fertilization levels, the integration of NP fertilization significantly changed the relative abundances of more bacterial phyla than the N and P fertilization did separately. Furthermore, the N10 and N20 fertilization treatments strengthened bacterial interactions, whereas P and NP fertilization did not affect the complexity and connectivity of the soil bacterial co-occurrence network. In addition, the mechanism of structuring the bacterial community for separate N and P fertilization differed from that for NP fertilization. The separate application of N and P fertilization affected the bacterial community composition mainly through changes in the total and available P levels in the soil, respectively, whereas NP fertilization shifted the bacterial community composition through decreasing plant species richness. These findings provide a quantification of the response of soil bacterial diversity and composition to different levels of N, P, and NP fertilization. It also suggests that in the Tibetan alpine meadow, soil bacterial communities may alter their fitness according to the relative abundances of oligotrophic/copiotrophic bacterial taxa, rather than through changing their diversity.

AB Objective: Contagious ecthyma is a severe and highly contagious disease caused by an orf virus (ORFV). The virus is responsible for substantial economic losses in the goat industry and threatens humans. We previously determined the role of ORFV129 protein, one of the five ankyrin-repeat proteins coded by the orf genome, in suppressing the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 & beta; and IFN-& gamma;. In the present study, we identified 14 cellular proteins (complement C1q binding protein [C1QBP], MCM7, EIF5A, PKM, SLC6A, TSPAN6, ATP6AP2, GPS1, MMADHC, HSPB6, SLC35B1, MTF1, P3H4, and IL15RA) that interact with ORFV129 using a yeast two-hybrid system in goat turbinate bone cells (GFTCs). The interaction between ORFV129 and (C1QBP), an immune-related protein, was confirmed using immunofluorescence co-localization and coimmunoprecipitation assays. C1QBP overexpression inhibited ORFV replication, whereas the knockdown of C1QBP promoted ORFV replication in GFTCs. Furthermore, ORFV or ORFV129 increased C1QBP expression in GFTCs, indicated that ORFV129-C1QBP interaction might contribute to the ORFV-induced host immune process. In addition, our research showed that ORFV increased the expression of ORFV129, cytokine IL-6, IL-1 & beta; and IFN-& gamma;. C1QBP overexpression induced IFN-& gamma; production and reduced IL-6 and IL-1 & beta; production. Conversely, C1QBP knockdown induced IL-1 & beta; production and reduced IFN-& gamma; and IL-1 & beta; production. Moreover, augmentation of ORFV129 expression enhanced the inhibition of the secretion of cytokines IL-6, IL-1 & beta;, and IFN-& gamma; induced by the altered expression of C1QBP. These findings suggest different downstream pathways might be involved in regulating different cytokines induced by ORFV129 expression in GFTCs.

AB PurposeThe overall nitrogen (N) cycling potential integrating multiple processes has not been examined, and the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic factors remain elusive. In this study, we proposed the N cycling index (NCI), based on the potential of biological N fixation, N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification, as a comprehensive indicator to characterize the overall soil N cycling potential in alpine meadow.Materials and methodsThe potential of individual N process sampled from the alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was quantified using incubation experiments in the laboratory. Four individual N process potentials (biological N fixation, N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification) were quantified and used to construct the NCI. The relative contributions of biotic (e.g., N-related microbial gene abundances, microbial community) and abiotic (e.g., geo-climate, soil, and plant properties) drivers shaping NCI were investigated using variation partitioning analysis and partial mantel test. The mechanism of the key factors controlling the overall soil N cycling potential in alpine meadow was revealed using structural equation modeling (SEM).Results and discussionThe soil NCI varied sensitively with the potential of individual N process, and it showed the highest and positive correlations with the denitrification potential in alpine meadows. Soil properties, N-related microbial gene abundances, alpha-diversity of bacterial and fungal communities, and fungal beta-diversity showed significant and positive relationships with soil NCI. Soil total phosphorous (TP) showed the greatest influence on NCI among all the environmental factors. Soil TP remarkably mediated NCI directly and indirectly by affecting N-related gene abundances.ConclusionsThe NCI could be used to indicate overall soil N cycling potentials and soil TP played a critical role in mediating soil N cycling in alpine meadow. Together, these findings provided novel insights into the important prediction of TP in the overall soil N cycling potential in alpine ecosystem.

AB Alkyl (aryl) titanium reagents are widely applied in organic synthesis because of their high nucleophi-licity, low toxicity, relative stability and easy preparation. The cross-coupling reactions between orga-notitanium reagents and organic electrophilic reagents using transition-metal catalysts or photocatalysis provide a simple method for the synthesis of a variety of organic compounds. Compared with lithium and magnesium reagents, organotitanium reagents have better functional group tolerance, such as nitro, ester, hydroxyl, amino, cyano and lactone moieties, which are well compatible. Therefore, many orga-notitanium reagents have been widely applied in cross-coupling reactions in recent years. This review briefly summarizes the advances of alkyl (aryl) titanium reagents in cross-coupling reactions, involving various reaction systems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simple SummaryAlthough the transcriptome of dairy cow mammary tissue has been reported, the transcriptome of yak mammary tissue remains unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the transcriptome of the mammary tissue of four yaks during the whole lactation cycle. The statistical analysis identified >6000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout lactation, with a large number of DEGs observed at the onset (1 d vs. -15 d) and at the end of lactation (240 d vs. 180 d). Bioinformatics analysis revealed a major role of lactation-associated genes on BTA3, BTA4, BTA6, BTA9, BTA14, and BTA28. Functions affected by the transcriptomic adaptation to lactation in mammary tissue of yak were very similar to those observed in dairy cows. Our study provides fundamental resources on yak mammary tissue transcriptome for the research community.The objective of this study was to assess the transcriptome of the mammary tissue of four yaks during the whole lactation cycle. For this purpose, biopsies of the mammary gland were performed at -30, -15, 1, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 days relative to parturition (d). The transcriptome analysis was performed using a commercial bovine microarray platform and the results were analyzed using several bioinformatic tools. The statistical analysis using an overall false discovery rate <= 0.05 for the effect of whole lactation and p < 0.05 for each comparison identified >6000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout lactation, with a large number of DEGs observed at the onset (1 d vs. -15 d) and at the end of lactation (240 d vs. 180 d). Bioinformatics analysis revealed a major role of genes associated with BTA3, BTA4, BTA6, BTA9, BTA14, and BTA28 in lactation. Functional analysis of DEG underlined an overall induction of lipid metabolism, suggesting an increase in triglycerides synthesis, likely regulated by PPAR signaling. The same analysis revealed an induction of amino acid metabolism and secretion of protein, with a concomitant decrease in proteasome, indicating a major role of amino acid handling and reduced protein degradation in the synthesis and secretion of milk proteins. Glycan biosynthesis was induced for both N-glycan and O-glycan, suggesting increased glycan content in the milk. The cell cycle and immune response, especially antigen processing and presentation, were strongly inhibited during lactation, suggesting that morphological changes are minimized during lactation, while the mammary gland prevents immune hyper-response. Transcripts associated with response to radiation and low oxygen were enriched in the down-regulated DEG affected by the stage of lactation. Except for this last finding, the functions affected by the transcriptomic adaptation to lactation in mammary tissue of yak are very similar to those observed in dairy cows.

AB Applying the multivariate heterogeneous autoregressive (MHAR-RV-DCC) model, this article considers the structural mutation characteristics of oil futures and the U.S. stock markets' information fluctuations, and em -beds Markov regime switching (MS) to investigate the prediction performance of the crude oil market volatility prediction model under the transition of high and low states, and explores whether the Markov mechanism conversion multivariate model constructed by nonparametric measurement variables will help the government, scholars and practitioners to judge the future market. We test the in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting. In comparison, our newly proposed multivariate MHAR-RV-DCC model and MS-MHAR-RV-DCC model have stronger predictive capabilities than other high-frequency volatility prediction models, the MS-MHAR-RV-SJV-DCC has the best predictive ability. The above empirical results not only affirm the advantages of the newly constructed multivariate and Markov regime switching models in the application of crude oil futures market forecasting but also broaden the research ideas and specific methods for the characterization and prediction of crude oil market volatility in the future.

AB We developed a route to rhodomyrtone analogs that feature different acyl groups at C7. Since electrophilic substitution reactions on the aryl part of the rhodomyrtone core led to C5 derivatives, the C5 position was blocked by a chlorine. Subsequent Duff type formylation followed by Grignard addition to the aldehyde group and oxidation gave various phenones. The benzyl protecting groups were removed by hydrogenation or boron tribromide. Some derivatives turned out to be quite active against multiple resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and a rhodomyrtone resistant mutant (Rom(R)).

AB In this paper, a family of novel diffusion adaptive estimation algorithms is proposed from the asymmetric cost function perspective by combining diffusion strategy and the linear-linear cost, quadratic-quadratic cost, and linear-exponential cost at all distributed network nodes, and named diffusion LLCLMS (DLLCLMS), diffusion QQCLMS (DQQCLMS), and diffusion LECLMS (DLECLMS), respectively. Then, the stability of mean estimation error and computational complexity of those three diffusion algorithms are analyzed theoretically. Finally, several experiment simulation results are designed to verify the superiority of those three proposed diffusion algorithms. Results show that DLLCLMS, DQQCLMS, and DLECLMS algorithms are more robust to the input signal and impulsive noise than the diffusion sign-error LMS, diffusion robust variable step-size least mean square (DRVSSLMS), and least mean logarithmic absolute difference algorithms. In brief, theoretical analysis and experiment results show that those proposed DLLCLMS, DQQCLMS, and DLECLMS algorithms perform better when estimating the unknown linear system under the changeable impulsive noise environments and different environments types of input signals.

ID TASK ASSIGNMENT; MODEL
AB Based on the Internet of Behavior (IoB), mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to recruit users by analyzing behavioral patterns. MCS is widely used in numerous large-scale and complex monitoring services, but it cannot provide stable and high-quality services due to nondeterministic user mobility and behaviors, which has a vital impact on recruiting high-quality users. In this article, a stochastic semialgebraic hybrid system (SSAHS) model is constructed to characterize the user mobility and behaviors of the MCS systems. Based on the definition of probabilistic path and task execution rate, a nondeterministic evaluation mechanism is proposed to measure nondeterministic user mobility and behaviors and to give the probability of the user completing the MCS task under the specified time bound and space conditions. The greater the probability is, the higher the quality of the user. Furthermore, a user recruitment scheme based on a non-deterministic evaluation mechanism (NUR) is developed. The NUR employs historical user data to predict user mobility and behaviors; high-quality users are recruited to quickly upload reliable sensing data. We conduct simulation experiments based on a real-world user trace dataset, Geolife.The results show that compared with competing recruitment strategies, NUR achieves a higher quality of service for the same MCS sensing tasks.

AB The layered two-dimensional nanomaterial MoS2 is a promising material for DNA/RNA sequence owing to its unique physical and chemical properties. However, pristine MoS2 nanosheets show poor sensitivity in distinguishing nucleobases molecules. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to study the vacancies on MoS2 surfaces to enhance the sensitivity and distinctions toward five nucleobase molecules. Monolayer MoS2 with Mo vacancy (VMo-MoS2) and S vacancy (VS-MoS2) were created. The results show that the sensitivity (S%) of pristine MoS2 was low because the change in the band gap was very small when interacting with T and U. V-Mo-MoS2 has a greater advantage in distinguishing nucleobase molecules because of the larger standard deviations(?). The VMo-MoS2 could effectively improve the sensitivity to distinguish T and U because S% was improved from 0.15 % to 3.1 % for U and 1.06 % to 6.9 % for T when they interact with VMoMoS2 than the pristine MoS2. Because of the physical interactions, the recovery time was short and no more than 4.27 s at 333 K for V-Mo-MoS2. Therefore, V-Mo-MoS2 is a promising candidate for DNA sequencing.

AB Simple Summary PDZK1-interacting protein 1 (PDZK1IP1) is a membrane-associated non-glycosylated protein and is involved in development and tumorigenesis. However, the role of PDZK1IP1 in goat subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation is unknown. In this work, we found that PDZK1IP1 acts as a regulator of adipogenesis, and inhibits goat subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation by promoting autophagy. The results will help to better understand the biological functions of PDZK1IP1 in goat subcutaneous preadipocytes and improve studies of its molecular mechanism. PDZK1IP1 is highly expressed in tumor tissue and has been identified as a tumor biomarker. However, the role of PDZK1IP1 in goat subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation remains largely unknown. The molecular mechanism of autophagy in regulating the differentiation of goat subcutaneous preadipocytes has not been clarified yet. In our study, PDZK1IP1 gain of function and loss of function were performed to reveal its functions in preadipocyte differentiation and autophagy. Our results showed that the overexpression of PDZK1IP1 inhibited the differentiation of goat subcutaneous preadipocytes, whereas it promoted autophagy. Consistently, the knockdown of PDZK1IP1 demonstrated the opposite tendency. Next, we investigated whether PDZK1IP1 inhibited the differentiation of goat preadipocytes by regulating autophagy. We found that inhibiting autophagy can rescue the PDZK1IP1-induced differentiation restraint in goat subcutaneous preadipocytes. In conclusion, PDZK1IP1 acts as a regulator of adipogenesis, and inhibits goat subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation through promoting autophagy. Our results will contribute to further understanding the role and mechanism of PDZK1IP1 in controlling adipogenesis.

AB A weather-image-classification model combining a VIT (vision transformer) and dual augmented attention module is proposed to address the problems of the insufficient feature-extraction capability of traditional deep-learning methods with the recognition accuracy still to be improved and the limited types of weather phenomena existing in the dataset. A pre-trained model vision transformer is used to acquire the basic semantic feature representation of weather images. Dual augmented attention combined with convolutional self-attention and Atrous self-attention modules are used to acquire the low-level and high-level deep-image semantic representations, respectively, and the feature vectors are spliced and fed into the linear layer to obtain the weather types. Experimental validation is performed on the publicly available standard weather-image datasets MWD (Multi-class Weather Database) and WEAPD (Weather Phenomenon Database), and the two datasets are combined to enhance the comprehensiveness of the model for weather-phenomena recognition. The results show that the model achieves the highest F1 scores of 97.47%, 87.69% and 92.73% on the MWD, WEAPD and merged datasets, respectively. These scores are higher than the scores of recent deep-learning models with excellent performance in the experimental comparison, thereby, proving the effectiveness of the model.

AB The proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts are considered the key biological processes in muscle development and muscle-related diseases, in which the miRNAs involved remain incompletely understood. Previous research reported that miR-424(322)-5p is highly expressed in mouse skeletal muscle. Therefore, C2C12 cells are used as a model to clarify the effect of miR-424(322)-5p on the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. The data show that miR-424(322)-5p exhibits a decreasing trend upon myogenic differentiation. Overexpression of miR-424 (322)-5p inhibits the proliferation of myoblasts, manifested by downregulation of proliferation marker genes ( CCNB1, CCND2, and CDK4), decreased percentage of EdU(+) cells, and reduced cell viability. In contrast, these phenotypes are promoted in myoblasts treated with an inhibitor of miR-424(322)-5p. Interestingly, its gain of function inhibits the expression of myogenic regulators, including MyoD, MyoG, MyHC, and Myf5. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining of MyHC and MyoD shows that overexpression of miR-424(322)-5p reduces the number of myotubes and decreases the myotube fusion index. Consistently, inhibition of its function mediated by an inhibitor promotes the expressions of myogenic markers and myotube fusion. Mechanistically, gene prediction and dual-luciferase reporter experiments confirm that enhancer of zeste homolog 1 ( Ezh1) is one of the targets of miR-424(322)-5p. Furthermore, knockdown of Ezh1 inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. Compared with NC and inhibitor treatment, inhibitor+si- EZH1 treatment rescues the phenotypes of proliferation and differentiation mediated by the miR-424(322)-5p inhibitor. Taken together, these data indicate that miR-424 (322)-5p targets Ezh1 to negatively regulate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts.

AB HnRNP K is a well-known member of HnRNP family proteins that has been implicated in the regulation of protein expression. Currently, the impact of HnRNP K on the reproduction cycle of a broad range of virus were reported, while the precise function for PRRSV was lacking. In this study, we determined that both PRRSV infection and ectopic expression of N protein induced an enrichment of HnRNP K in the cytoplasm. Using RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation, we described the interactions between the KH2 domain of HnRNP K and cytosine-rich sequences (CRS) in PRRSV genomic RNA corresponding to Nsp7 alpha coding region. Meanwhile, overexpression of HnRNP K inhibited viral gene expression and PRRSV replication, while silencing of HnRNP K resulted in an increased in virus yield. Taken together, this study assists in the understanding of PRRSV-host interactions, and the development of vaccines based on viral genome engineering.

AB Addressed in this paper is the stability issue of continuous-time switched linear systems consisting of both stable and unstable subsystems under switching signals satisfying the constraint of mode-dependent average dwell time. A multiple discontinuous homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function (MDHPLF) method is proposed, which results in, compared with existing works, less conservative sufficient conditions guaranteeing exponential stability of systems under consideration. It is proven that the conservatism of stability condition reduces as the degree of MDHPLF increases. In addition, all main results can be applied to scenarios where all subsystems are stable or unstable.

AB Microwave-assisted chemical reactions have been widely used, but the overheating effect limits further applications. The aim of this paper is to investigate the coupling degree of the electromagnetic field and thermal field in microwave-heating chemical reactions whose polarization changes as the reactions proceed. First, the entropy-balance equation of microwave-heating polar-molecule reactions is obtained. Then, the coupling degree of the electromagnetic field and the thermal field in microwave-heating polar-molecule reactions is derived, according to the entropy-balance equation. Finally, the effects of reaction processes on the degree of coupling are discussed. When the time scale of the component-concentration variation is much greater than the wave period during the chemical processes, the degree of coupling is sufficiently small, and the electric and thermal fields are considered as weakly coupled. On the other hand, the degree of coupling may change during the reactions. If the absolute value of the coupling degree becomes larger, due to the change in component concentration, this will lead to a transition from weak coupling to strong coupling.

TI What Is the Rational Choice of Community Governance Policy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE policy rationality; consistency or conflict; urban community governance
   policy; rural community governance; China
AB Community governance is the "micro-cell" of social governance and the foundation of the governance system. The rational selection logic of community governance policy reflects the value orientation, goal selection, and tool guarantee of governance policy. It is the result of the interaction between government and public values and it reflects the final value choice in the form of policy text and tries to balance policy rationality through accurate calculation. Through the analysis of 100 government work reports and 63 community governance policy documents of the Chinese government from 2013 to 2022, it was found that "People-oriented" was the core value orientation of governance policy. "Better life" was a key target choice for governance policy. "Diversified tools" were an important implementation guarantee for governance policy. These rational choices were consistent between the central and the local governments, but there was a conflict between localities. Urban and rural community governance policies need to establish a public space between policy rationality and value selection to solve the targeting bias of policy rationality in the future. This paper solves the conflict between policy rationality and value choice using the paths of expert think tank construction, highlighting leading goals, and using technology empowerment, to adjust the tension between the two through reasonable value choice and balanced policy rationality, to achieve the goal of urban and rural community governance modernization.

AB The economic and technological development zone (ETDZ) serves an essential role in driving green development and ecological civilization. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the impact of ETDZs on eco-efficiency for sustainable development. This paper investigates the impact of the establishment of ETDZs on eco-efficiency by constructing a differences-in-differences (DID) model on the basis of 253 cities in China from 2004 to 2017 as the dataset. This paper also explores the possible intrinsic impact mechanisms through the channels of industrial structure and technological innovation by constructing a mediating effect model, and the heterogeneous effects of ETDZs on eco-efficiency from the perspectives of regional imbalance and city class heterogeneity. Statistical results report that ETDZs significantly positively affect eco-efficiency and such effects are most significant in the first year after the establishment of ETDZs. Industrial structure upgrading and technological innovation are essential role mechanisms for ETDZs to enhance eco-efficiency. Besides, the enhancement effect of ETDZs on eco-efficiency is only observed in the eastern part of the city, with an insignificant inhibitory effect in central and western parts of the cities. However, the establishment of ETDZs in cities with higher city classes is more beneficial to improve eco-efficiency.

AB Background: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally. A large propor-tion of ischemic strokes are caused by carotid atherosclerotic plaques. However, the relationship between vascular health status (arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunc-tion) and carotid plaque remains unclear. Our strategy: Here, we recruited 991 subjects with carotid plaques and 1170 subjects without carotid plaques to measure arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, using a logistic regression model and multiple linear regression models to predict the relationship between them and carotid plaques. Main results: The data revealed that patients with carotid plaques presented a signifi-cantly higher mean of cf-PWV and lower mean RHI values. Age, male gender, diabe-tes, hypertension, and smoking contributed to plaque formation. Carotid plaques and their lengths were negatively associated with RHI values and positively associated with cf-PWV values; diabetes combined with hypertension showed a cumulative effect on arteriosclerosis. Conclusion: RHI combined with cf-PWV could improve the efficacy of predicting the presence of carotid plaques and their lengths.

AB Objective: Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by a variety of functional genes and non -coding RNAs. However, the role of miRNAs in lipid deposition of goat white adipose tissue is still unclear. Therefore, this study revealed the miRNA expression profile in goat sub-cutaneous adipocytes by sRNA-seq.Methods: The miRNA expressed in goat subcutaneous preadipocytes and the mature adipocytes were sequenced by sRNA-seq. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEm) were screened and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia for genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function combined with oil red O staining, Bodipy staining, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were utilized to determine the effect of miR-133a-3p on adipocyte differentiation.Results: A total of 218 DEm were screened out. The target genes of these DEm were significantly enriched in GO items such as biological regulation and in KEGG terms such as FAK signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway. qPCR verified that the expression trend of miRNA was consistent with miRNA-seq. The gain-of-function or loss-of-function of miR-133a-3p showed that it promoted or inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets, and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and C/EBP beta were extremely significantly up-regulated or down-regulated respectively (p<0.01), the loss-of-function also led to a significant down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) (p<0.01).Conclusion: This study successfully identified miRNAs expression patterns in goat sub-cutaneous adipocytes, and functional identification indicates that miR-133a-3p is a positive regulator of the differentiation process of goat subcutaneous adipocytes.

AB According to the traditional theory of industrial organizations, differentiated competition leads to higher returns. However, Chinese eCommerce platforms tend to homogenize in the choice of operational strategies, which deviates from the principle of differentiated competition. Some competitive eCommerce platforms were described based on the hotelling model, and a sequential game model for the competition of ecosystems was built to analyze the choice of operation strategies. From the perspective of a business ecosystem, this paper studied the impact of the strategy choice of the core platform on the ecological profit. The results showed that an open strategy would always improve the performance of business ecosystems and could even benefit the competitive ecosystem because of its spillover effect. The equilibrium of the competitive platforms was related to the game strategies, independent of the distribution contracts of the suppliers. We found that the platforms' positions deviated from the maximum difference principle due to network externalities, and differentiation did not improve the profits of platforms.

AB To contribute to the conservation of endangered animals, the utilization of model systems is critical to analyze the function of their gut microbiota. In this study, the results of a fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) experiment with germ-free (GF) mice receiving giant panda or horse fecal microbiota showed a clear clustering by donor microbial communities in GF mice, which was consistent with the results of blood metabolites from these mice. At the genus level, FMT re-established approximately 9% of the giant panda donor microbiota in GF mice compared to about 32% for the horse donor microbiota. In line with this, the difference between the panda donor microbiota and panda-mice microbiota on whole-community level was significantly larger than that between the horse donor microbiota and the horse-mice microbiota. These results were consistent with source tracking analysis that found a significantly higher retention rate of the horse donor microbiota (30.9%) than the giant panda donor microbiota (4.0%) in GF mice where the microbiota remained stable after FMT. Further analyzes indicated that the possible reason for the low retention rate of the panda donor microbiota in GF mice was a low relative abundance of Clostridiaceae in the panda donor microbiota. Our results indicate that the donor microbiota has a large effect on GF mice microbiota after FMT.

AB Eco-friendly (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based electrostrictive materials have attracted increasing attention as potential candidates for high-precision displacement actuators. Although a series of breakthroughs have increased the electrostrictive coefficient of KNN-based materials with relaxor behaviour (Q33 > 0.0450 m4/C2), the electro-strictive strain is still low (<0.1%), making the improvement of the electrostrictive strain a crucial next step. Here, a KNN-based relaxor ceramic of 0.96K0.48Na0.52Nb1-xSbxO3-0.04Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3-0.3%Fe2O3 (KNNSx-BNZ) was designed to simultaneously achieve high electrostrictive strain and Q33. The phase structure transformed from the T phase to the C phase with increasing Sb concentration, which also introduced fine grains and domains. A high electrostrictive strain (-0.102%) and Q33 (-0.0461 m4/C2) were obtained at x = 0.09 through a small adjustment of the structure of the relaxor, while an electrostrictive strain with low hysteresis (<10.5%) and an outstanding temperature stability (>= 95%) were achieved in the broadened temperature range of 20-180 degrees C, representing properties superior to those of previous KNN-based and typical PZT-based materials. Our results will help researchers understand how to balance the strain and electrostrictive coefficient in lead-free materials, and thereby contribute toward accelerating the application of KNN-based electrostrictive materials in actuators.

AB BackgroundThe major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene family, a vital immune gene family in vertebrates, helps animals defend against pathogens. The polymorphism of MHC genes is important for a species and is considered to be caused by the numerous alleles of MHC antigen-presenting genes. However, the mechanism of this process is unclear due to the lack of data on the MHC structure. The evolutionary trajectories of the tetrapod MHC are also unclear because of insufficient studies on the reptile MHC architecture. Here, we studied the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis), which experienced a population bottleneck, but the population increased rapidly in the past 30 years and is proposed to have a unique MHC system to face pathogenic challenges. ResultsWe successfully constructed a 2 Mb MHC region using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library and genome data of the Chinese alligator and checked the antigen-presenting genes using transcriptome data and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The MHC architecture reported here uncovers adjacent Class I and Class II subregions and a unique CD1 subregion. This newly added information suggested that the Class I-II structure pattern was more ancient in tetrapods and helped reconstruct the evolution of the MHC region architecture. We also found multiple groups of MHC class I (MHC-I) (12 duplicated loci, belonging to three groups, two of which were novel) and MHC class II (MHC-II) (11 duplicated loci, belonging to two groups) inside the 2 Mb MHC region, and there were three more duplicated MHC-I loci outside it. These highly duplicated antigen-presenting loci had differences in expression, amino acid length of antigen-presenting exons, and splice signal of exon and intron, which together promoted the polymorphism of duplicated genes. Although the MHC antigen-presenting genes were identified as monomorphic or oligomorphic in our previous population study, the loci with high copy numbers and many differences can make up for this loss, presenting another mechanism for polymorphism in antigen presentation. These MHC-I and MHC-IIB loci with low polymorphism for each locus, but high numbers in all, may also contribute to MHC antigen-presenting binding variability in a population. ConclusionTo summarize, the fine MHC region architecture of reptiles presented in this study completes the evolutionary trajectories of the MHC structure in tetrapods, and these distinctive MHC gene groups in the Chinese alligator may have helped this species to expand rapidly in the past recent years.

AB Understanding the altitudinal patterns of plant stoichiometry in seeds is critical for characterizing important germination and dormancy strategies, soil seed bank composition, seed predation probability, efficiency of seed dispersal and seedling performance, and to predict how biodiversity might be influenced by climate change. However, our understanding of the altitudinal patterns of seed stoichiometry is extremely limited. In this study, we measured the concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the seeds of 253 herbaceous species along an altitudinal transect (2,000-4,200 m) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, and further to characterize seed C:N:P stoichiometry. The geometric means of C, N, and P concentrations were 569.75 mg/g, 34.76 mg/g, and 5.03 mg/g, respectively. The C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios were 16.39, 113.31, and 6.91, respectively. The seed C, N, and P concentrations and C:N:P ratios varied widely among major plant groups and showed significant altitudinal trends. In general, C, N, and P concentrations increased, whereas seed C:N:P ratios decreased with elevation. These results inform our understanding of the altitudinal patterns of seed stoichiometry and how to model ecosystem nutrient cycling.

AB Environmentally friendly potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics are potential electronic functional materials due to multiphase coexistence. Aliovalent doping on the A-site with different ions plays a key role in phase boundary engineering. However, the difference of contribution to the phase boundary from various A-site dopants is not clear in multielement high performance KNN-based ceramics. Herein, the individual contribution to phase structure and comparison of typical aliovalent ions (Bi3+ and Ca2+) on the A-site, are considered in terms of influence on electrical properties. Within a maintained rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary at room temperature, both phase transition temperatures for rhombohedral-orthorhombic (TR-O) and orthorhombic-tetragonal (TO-T) gradually enhance with increasing Ca2+ and decreasing Bi3+, resulting in elevating R phase and reducing T phase. This phenomenon indicates that the contribution of Ca2+ to increase TR-O is stronger than that from Bi3+, while the effect on decreasing TO-T from Ca2+ is weaker with respect to Bi3+ during phase boundary formation. The enhancement of TR-O and TO-T is due to the lower electronegativity of Ca2+ than Bi3+ which benefits an R phase with high ionicity. There is only a small change in T-C and diffusion degree when Bi3+ is replaced by Ca2+, because of the similar substitution of Bi3+ and Ca2+ on the A-site. Meanwhile, enhanced O vacancies are due to the lower valence of Ca2+ than that of Bi3+. Then, electrical properties including ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity and strain, retain high values originating from the maintained R-O-T phase boundary. Moreover, improved stability of piezoelectricity and strain under changing temperature, are achieved based on enhanced TO-T. Thus, this work provides an effective method to further optimize multiphase structures via appropriate doping in KNN-based ceramics.

AB In recent years, the bitcoin market has developed rapidly and has been recognized as a new type of gold by many investors. It may replace gold as a hedge against inflation and become a new investment asset for financial management. The investment relationship with gold has increasingly important research value and practical significance. This paper modeled daily price flow data from 11 September 2016 to 10 September 2021 to help market traders determine whether they need to buy, hold, or sell assets in their portfolios daily. The model predicts price fluctuations through linear regression prediction of machine learning, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. In the linear regression prediction, the goodness of fit of gold is 89.44%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 98.43%. In the test set prediction of KNN algorithm, the goodness of fit of gold is 97.25%, and the goodness of fit of Bitcoin is 95.06%. Based on this, the optimal investment strategy and the initial investment value are obtained. Empirical analysis shows that bitcoin price volatility and gold price volatility have a strong substitution effect; gold and currency used will be a suitable combination of hedging, which will bring momentum for the development of the market economy and become an important force in the sustainable development of a high-quality-driven economy.

AB Three basic amino acid-based cationic lipids bearing a fluorescent naphthalimide moiety and a reducible disulfide linkage are synthesized and applied as non-viral gene vehicles. Their DNA interactions are investigated by agarose-gel retardant and ethidium bromide replacement assays. The sizes and zeta potentials of the liposome/DNA complexes are measured by dynamic light scattering. The cytotoxicities of the liposome/DNA complexes are examined using HeLa and 7702 cell lines by MTT assays. The glutathione-responsive DNA release process is studied through time-dependent fluorescence assays. Luciferase gene expression showed the transfection efficiency of the liposome is dramatically increased in the presence of 10% serum. Confocal laser scanning microscopy studies corroborated that the liposome/DNA complexes are successfully uptaken into HeLa cells. These results demonstrate the promising use of amino acids and naphthalimide-containing lipids for safe and efficient gene delivery.

AB As a member of the PGAMs family, PGAM2 has been proved to catalyze the reversible reaction of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) in the glycolytic pathway. However, it is unclear whether PGAM2 has a role in regulating differentiation in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Here, this study was carried to clone the open reading frame (ORF) of goat PGAM2, elucidate its molecular and expressional characteristics, and evaluate the involvement in adipogenesis of intramuscular preadipocytes. According to our findings, the cloned goat PGAM2 gene was 784 bp in full length, including 762 bp of ORF and encoding a protein of 253 amino acids. The expressional level of PGAM2 peaked at 48 hours after induced adipogenic differentiation and was highest in the skeletal muscle of triceps. Moreover, overexpression of PGAM2 transfected by its overexpression plasmid promotes lipid accumulation of goat intramuscular adipocyte as shown by Oil Red O and bodipy staining, accompanied by up-regulating the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) (p < 0.001), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) (p < 0.001), CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) (p < 0.01) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (p < 0.01). Taken together, these findings indicate that PGAM2 is a positive regulator for goat intramuscular adipocytes and provide new insights into improvement intramuscular fat deposition in goat meat.

AB Urea is frequently used as a protein supplement in ruminant diets, but if used improperly, it can easily result in urea poisoning. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of excessive urea feeding on rumen pathology and microbial diversity of the Jianzhou Da'er goat (Capra hircus). In this study, 9 male Jianzhou Da'er goats with an average weight of 22.9 kg were randomly divided into the control group (0% urea), 5% urea group and 10% urea group (dry matter basis, 3 goats per group). Morphological differences of rumen tissues were analyzed by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and Prussian blue staining, and rumen microorganisms differences were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing on the Illumina Novaseq platform. Histopathological analysis showed that the length of rumen papilla in the 5% urea and 10% urea groups were shortened compared to the control group, and the thickness of the stratum corneum and muscular layer were significantly thinned (P < 0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that microbial richness and diversity were significantly lower in goats fed on 5% urea or 10% urea, the abundance of Prevotella ruminicola was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the abundance of Ruminobacter amylophilus was significantly increased (P < 0.05), as compared with the control group. This study indicated that feeding 5% and 10% urea could damage rumen tissue morphology. Feeding 10% urea significantly reduced rumen microbial diversity and the abundance of Prevotella ruminicola, but increased the abundance of Ruminobacter amylophilus.

AB Cattleyaks, a hybrid of (_) and yak (\), exhibit the marked productivity and adaptability of plateau, but suffer from male infertility. Small non-coding RNAs, especially miRNAs, play crucial roles in spermatogenesis and affect the growth of Sertoli cells (SCs). The objective of the present study was to explore the interaction between miR-34b-5p and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 11 (PPP1R11) and its effect on cattleyak SCs. RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression pattern of miR-34b-5p and PPP1R11, while the cellular and subcellular localization of PPP1R11 was determined by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. The interaction between MiR-34b-5p and PPP1R11 was evaluated by immunofluorescence, proliferation, apoptosis, and western blotting assays. The potential binding sites between miR-34b-5p and PPP1R11 were uncovered through targeted search of an online database, and verified using a dual luciferase reporter system. Our data show that miR-34b-5p is differentially expressed in the testes and SCs of cattleyaks compared to yaks. Overexpression of miR-34b-5p in SCs suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis, while the effects of miR-34b-5p knockdown were the reverse. The 30UTR of PPP1R11 was identified as a potential target site of miR-34b-5p, and this was validated by online database searches and our data from the dual-luciferase reporter assay, and it displayed an inverse expression pattern to miR-34b-5p in SCs. The effects of silencing PPP1R11 by siRNA were similar to the results of miR-34b-5p upregulation, but significantly different from miR-34b-5p downregulation in cattleyak SCs. The effects with PPP1R11 overexpression were opposite, suggesting a novel biofunctional role of PPP1R11 inactivation in depressing cattleyak SCs growth. Lastly, we confirmed that miR-34b-5p inhibited PPP1R11 expression and induced apoptosis by regulating proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes in SCs. Thus, miR-34b-5p regulates the apoptosis and proliferation of cattleyak SCs via targeting PPP1R11, which can provide an innovative direction for exploring the mechanism of cattleyak male sterility.

AB This study investigates the characteristics of posttraumatic growth (PTG) and academic burnout among adolescents in an ethnic minority area in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and examines the moderating role of core belief challenge on the association between PTG and academic burnout. This study surveyed 941 secondary school students in Wenchuan using the posttraumatic growth inventory, adolescent academic burnout inventory, core beliefs inventory, and a self-designed demographic questionnaire. The results showed that: (1) Five months after the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the level of PTG among adolescents in the Wenchuan area was high and its prevalence was 32.3%. Among them, the dimension of perceived changes in self was the highest, and the PTG level of junior high school students was higher than that of high school students. The academic burnout level of adolescents, particularly emotional exhaustion, was also high. The academic burnout level of the high school students was higher than that of junior high school students. (2) There was a significant negative correlation between PTG and academic burnout among adolescents. (3) Core belief challenge moderated the relationship between PTG and academic burnout. PTG had a significant negative predictive effect on adolescents' academic burnout only when the core belief challenge was above a moderate level. These results showed the uniqueness of PTG and psychological behavioral problems of adolescents in ethnic minority areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also emphasized the key role of core belief challenge in the process of PTG in reducing adolescents' academic burnout. Based on these results, recommendations are provided to alleviate academic burnout among adolescents in Wenchuan against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. While providing full play to ethnic minority cultural characteristics to promote posttraumatic growth, guiding adolescents' value reflection and cognitive reconstruction should be focused on.

AB The subject of how to facilitate cooperation of evolution through different mecha-nisms has been intensively investigated. For snowdrift game, researches have shown that a moderate dilution of the number of neighbors of individuals will benefit the evolution of cooperation, and have not shown how different dilution degrees effect evolution of cooperation. This paper proposes a proportional-neighborhood-diversity (PND) mechanism which takes into account some relatively typical situations. The core lies in: We provide a proportional vector to indicate the proportion of individuals with different number of interactive neighbors. Each player has fixed spatial neighbors and only plays with interactive neighbors selected from its spatial neighbors. This study is performed by means of the Monte Carlo method and an extended pair-approximation method. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that, compared with the traditional case, introducing different dilution degrees in evolution promotes the emergence of cooperative behavior. An interesting phenomenon is that when most individuals have a smaller number of interactive neighbors, the cooperation level is relatively higher. When applied to the evolutionary game, the PND mechanism can reduce game cost since the number of interactive neighbors is less than that of fixed neighbors in whole evolutionary process. Moreover, it has potential role in social management since the proposed mechanism is more realistic.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Semi-Self-Supervised Intrusion Detection System for Multilevel

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Industry 4.0 affects all components of the modern industry value chain. The accelerating use of the Internet and the convergence of industrial and operational networks constantly increase the need for secure industrial communication solutions. Therefore, "multilevel industrial cyber protection" is critical to Industry 4.0. In general, industrial protection refers to safeguarding information and data and the intellectual property rights of production processes related to the overall industry environment. The availability, integrity, and confidentiality of systems must be maintained. The goal challenge is the best possible protection from attacks and threats which create immediate financial damage and other risks in the industry (reputation, etc.). Based on the Defense-in-Depth strategy, a holistic, multilayered, and in-depth protection of industrial systems is developed in this paper. Specifically, a Semi-Self-Supervised Intrusion Detection System (S3IDS) is proposed, which combines advanced machine learning techniques for industrial data noise reduction to automate the discovery and separation of classes, which are essentially equivalent to cyber-related anomalies. As demonstrated by a mathematical simulation based on computational number theory and specifically on the concept of the single object, the proposed S3IDS learns to accurately reconstruct samples to predict the nature of an anomaly created directly by the industrial ecosystem.

AB The leopard (Panthera pardus) has the largest natural distribution from low- to high-altitude areas of any wild felid species, but recent studies have revealed that leopards have disappeared from large areas, probably owing to poaching, a decline of prey species, and habitat degradation. Here, we reported the chromosome-scale genome assembly of the high-altitude leopard (HL) based on nanopore sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Panthera genomes revealed similar repeat composition, and there was an appreciably conserved synteny between HL and the other two Panthera genomes. Divergence time analysis based on the whole genomes revealed that the HL and the low-altitude leopard differentiate from a common ancestor similar to 2.2 Ma. Through comparative genomics analyses, we found molecular genetic signatures that may reflect high-altitude adaptation of the HL. Three HL-specific missense mutations were detected in two positively selected genes, that is, ITGA7 (Ala112Gly, Asp113Val, and Gln115Pro) and NOTCH2 (Ala2398Ser), which are likely to be associated with hypoxia adaptation. The chromosome-level genome of the HL provides valuable resources for the investigation of high-altitude adaptation and protection management of the vulnerable leopard.

AB Objective: The present study was conducted to examine the gas production, fermentation characteristics, nutrient degradation, and methanogenic community composition of a rumen fluid culture with Broussonetia papyrifera (B. papyrifera) subjected to ensiling or steam explosion (SE) pretreatment.Methods: Fresh B. papyrifera was collected and pretreated by ensiling or SE, which was then fermented with ruminal fluids as ensiled B. papyrifera group, steam-exploded B. papyrifera group, and untreated B. papyrifera group. The gas and methane production, fermentation characteristics, nutrient degradation, and methanogenic community were determined during the fermentation.Results: Cumulative methane production was significantly improved with SE pretreatment compared with ensiled or untreated biomass accompanied with more volatile fatty acids production. After 72 h incubation, SE and ensiling pretreatments decreased the acid detergent fiber contents by 39.4% and 22.9%, and neutral detergent fiber contents by 10.6% and 47.2%, respectively. Changes of methanogenic diversity and abundance of methanogenic archaea corresponded to the variations in fermentation pattern and methane production.Conclusion: Compared with ensiling pretreatment, SE can be a promising technique for the efficient utilization of B. papyrifera, which would contribute to sustainable livestock production systems.

AB In this paper, we introduce and study a new class of differential set-valued inverse variational inequalities in finite dimensional spaces. By applying a result on differential inclusions involving an upper semicontinuous set-valued mapping with closed convex values, we first prove the existence of Caratheodory weak solutions for differential set-valued inverse variational inequalities. Then, by the existence result, we establish the stability for the differential set-valued inverse variational inequality problem when the constraint set and the mapping are perturbed by two different parameters. The closedness and continuity of Caratheodory weak solutions with respect to the two different parameters are obtained.

AB Smilax glabra Roxb. (SG) is widely used as functional food with various beneficial effects. Fresh SG without processing has been eaten directly for anti-inflammation from ancient China, while the underlying mechanism remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of fresh SG by using metabolites profiles, affinity ultrafiltration mass spectrometry, PDE4 enzyme inhibition assay, and in silica analysis. Encouragingly, fresh SG showed promising anti-inflammatory effect with IC50 value (0.009 mu g/mu L) on PDE4 was about 12 times higher than that of processed SG (0.110 mu g/mu L). Astilbin was identified as the main bioactive compound of fresh SG responsible for PDE4 inhibitory activity. We found that heat processing strongly affected astilbin isomerization, leading to significant changes in contents and PDE4 inhibitory activities of four astilbin isomers, resulting in decreased anti-inflammatory activity of fresh SG. This finding will provide theoretical basis for systematic research and food/nutraceutical applications of fresh Smilax glabra in the future.

AB The untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes play crucial roles in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level such as affecting mRNA stabilization. In this study, 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one deletion located in UTR were genotyped from 186 Dazu black goats via SNaPshot, and the correlation between genotype and litter size was analyzed. The results indicated that two SNP loci, SNP_chr17-20182525 and SNP_chr7-65652612, which were located at the 3' UTR of scavenger receptor class B member 1 and follistatin-like 4, were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the litter size of first parity goats. SNP_chr7-65652612 was also significantly associated with the total litter size of first and second parity offspring (P < 0.05). In conclusion, SNP_chr7-65652612 and SNP_chr17-20182525 have correlation with the litter size of Dazu black goat and they are potential genetic markers for litter size breeding.

AB Ground force is the key index to evaluate the output of the seismic vibrator. To generate desired ground force, the relationship between coupling parameters and ground force should be investigated. In this paper, a method for calculating ground force is proposed based on half-space theory, and its validity is carried out by field test. According to the analysis of coupling parameters, the baseplate's mass, the mass of reaction-mass, the baseplate area, the soil elastic modulus, and the soil density are determined to be analyzed. The ground forces under the changes of coupling parameters are studied. Results show that each parameter has a different contribution to affecting the ground force at different frequencies. The heavier reaction mass is beneficial for greater vibration output below 20 Hz. Smaller baseplate mass, bigger baseplate area, and higher soil density are helpful to increase ground force in the band of 20-50 Hz. In addition, higher soil elastic modulus brings greater ground force beyond 50 Hz. Then global sensitivity analysis for ground force is investigated with Sobol's method. It indicates that the ground force is dominated by the reaction mass at low frequencies. With significant interactions, the soil elastic modulus has a great effect on the ground force at high frequencies, followed by the baseplate's mass, baseplate area, and soil density.

AB A total of 14 Festuca sinensis seed lots were collected from different geographical locations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to study the seed microbiota and determine the abiotic (temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and biotic (Epichloe sinensis infection rate) factors likely to shape the seed microbiome. The 14 seed lots had different bacterial and fungal structures and significantly different diversities (p < 0.05). The alpha-diversity indices of the bacteria were significantly correlated with precipitation (p < 0.05), whereas those of the fungi were significantly correlated with temperature (p < 0.05). Microbiota analysis showed that Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant bacteria at the phylum level in the seeds, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most abundant fungi. beta-diversity analysis suggested large differences in the microbial communities of each sample. Redundancy analysis showed that temperature and precipitation were the main environmental factors that drive variations in the microbial community, at the medium-high elevation (3,000-4,500 m), the impact of temperature and precipitation on microbial community is different, and the other elevations that effect on microbial community were basically identical. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the relative abundances of the most abundant bacterial phyla were significantly correlated with temperature (p < 0.05), whereas those of the most abundant fungal phyla were significantly correlated with precipitation (p < 0.05). E. sinensis infection rates were significantly correlated with elevation and temperature (p < 0.05). These results suggest that temperature and precipitation are the key factors driving the microbial community, that temperature and elevation also had a great influence on the E. sinensis infection rate, and that environmental factors (temperature and elevation) may further affect the microbial community by regulating the E. sinensis infection rate.

AB This study aims to analyse the connection between energy efficiency and renewable energy consumption in the emerging seven (E7) economies during the period 1990-2020. This study also examines the impact of economic growth, carbon emissions and technological innovation on renewable energy. This study employs various panel data approaches that validate the irregular distribution of data and the heterogeneous slopes coefficients. The cross-section dependence test confirms that cross-section dependence is present in the study variables. While these variables are cointegrated. Using non-parametric panel data approaches, the moments' quantile regression results unveil that economic growth is positively associated with renewable energy in all quantiles. Whereas energy efficiency and carbon emissions showed mixed results, negatively affect renewable energy consumption in the lower quantiles, insignificant in the medium quantiles and positive in the higher quantiles. On the other hand, technological innovation is found negatively related to renewable energy consumption. Bidirectional causal association is found between explanatory variables and renewable energy consumption. Based on the empirical findings, this study suggests policies to divert economic growth from fossil fuel energy consumption, enhancing investment in the renewable energy sector, promoting energy efficiency and investment in environmental-related technologies to promote renewable energy.

AB The efficiency of manual ballad creation is low, and the status quo of music creation education still needs to be improved. Therefore, how to upgrade the creative level of students is studied to improve the creative ability of China's unique ballad culture. The concept of music theory in the process of music creation is explained, and the application of big data in the NetEase cloud music platform is excavated. Besides, the optical music organization (OMR) method based on artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed using a learning method of style imitation. This method is applied to students' ballad creation education and tested in the school creation curriculum. It is found that the novelty of the ballads created by the system is slightly better than the existing ballads by comparing the ballads created by the machine with those used as imitation templates. In addition, the students' learning interests and creative achievement are compared through the comparative experiment. The results show that students' interest in learning has been significantly improved, and their creative performance in oral language has also been enhanced compared with the control class. As a result, this system is considered to be able to be applied in students' ballad creation courses and provide some basis for AI creation in related fields.

AB The red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) has been demoted to "vulnerable species" because its populations have apparently stabilized in Japan and Korea. Low variation and genetic drift may cause damage to the nascent recovery of the G. japonensis population. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most polymorphic gene families in the vertebrate genome and can reflect information on the adaptive evolution of endangered species. In this study, variations in MHC I exon 3 of captive G. japonensis in China were assessed and compared with those in cranes from Japan. Forty MHC alleles of 274 base pairs were isolated from 32 individuals from two captive populations in China. There was high variability in the nucleotide and amino acid composition, showing the proportion of polymorphic sites of 18.98 and 32.97%, respectively. Comparative analyses of the Chinese and Japanese populations based on 222 base pair sequences revealed more alleles and higher variation in the Chinese population. The lack of significant geographical differentiation of G. japonensis was supported by the genetic differentiation coefficient (0.04506) between the Chinese and Japanese populations. Positive selection of antigen-binding sites was observed, which contributed to maintaining the diversity of MHC class I genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the persistence of trans-species polymorphisms among MHC class I genes in Gruidae species. Our results may contribute to optimizing the management of G. japonensis populations and population recovery of this threatened species.

AB Hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HABP4) plays important roles in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis. However, its functions in regulating cell apoptosis remain unclear. To reveal the effects of HABP4 on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis, the HABP4 sequence was cloned, and we investigated the gain and loss functions of HABP4 in goat turbinate bone cells. Our results showed that a 1,496-bp HABP4 sequence was cloned successfully. The interference effect of siRNA1 on HABP4 was the strongest, reducing its mRNA expression level by 83%, decreasing the cells in the G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and inhibiting cell growth and apoptosis. The overexpression of HABP4 produced contrasting results. Furthermore, an HABP4 knockdown caused the up-regulated expression of genes associated with apoptosis, including Bcl-2 and BCL2L11, but the down-regulation of Caspase3, Caspase7, Bax, PARP1, SOCS2 and P53 mRNA levels. Additionally, HABP4 overexpression significantly up-regulated the expression levels of Bax, Caspase3, Caspase7, BCL2L11, P53, SOCS2 and PARP1. However, the expression of Bcl-2 was down-regulated. These data provide an important foundation for further in-depth studies of HABP4 functions.

AB Bovine hepacivirus (BovHepV) is a novel virus that was recently discovered in Ghana and Germany in 2015. Until now, this virus has been identified in cattle population worldwide and is classified into subtypes A-G. To fully understand the epidemic situation and genetic characteristic of BovHepV in China, a total of 612 cattle serum samples were collected from 20 farms in seven provinces and municipality in China between 2018 and 2020 and were tested for the presence of BovHepV RNA via semi-nested PCR. The results demonstrated that 49 (8.0%) samples were BovHepV RNA-positive. It is noted that BovHepV infection in yak was confirmed for the first time. BovHepV was detected in all the seven provinces, with the positive rate ranging from 3.1% to 13.3%, which indicates a wide geographical distribution pattern of BovHepV in China. Sequencing results revealed that 5' UTR of the 49 field BovHepV strains have a nucleotide similarity of 96.3%-100% between each other and 93.9%-100% with previously reported BovHepV strains. In addition, genetic analysis identified five critical nucleotide sites in 5' UTR to distinguish different subtypes, which was further verified by genomic sequencing and nucleotide similarity analysis. All the 49 Chinese field BovHepV strains were classified into subtype G and this subtype is only determined in cattle in China currently. This study will provide insights for us to better understand the epidemiology and genetic diversity of BovHepV.

Our iiPCR assay detected M. haemolytica clinical isolates successfully and produced negative results on other bovine or ovine respiratory pathogens, including Histophilus somni, Bibersteinia trehalosi, Trueperella pyogenes, Streptococcus suis, and Mycoplasma spp., indicating that the PCR reactions were specific. Additionally, our iiPCR assay detected as few as 21 copies of genomic DNA and 17.2 cfu/mL of bacterial culture, which was 10 and 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR, respectively. Our iiPCR assay can be performed on a portable device in a total of 58 min and may be a useful tool for the detection of M. haemolytica in bovine and ovine respiratory disease in the field.

AB Simple Summary To elucidate the differences in milk protein compositions and mammary gland functions between yaks of standard lactation (TL yaks) and prolonged lactation (HL yaks), iTRAQ technique was used to compare the skim milk proteins in the two yak groups. A total of 202 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed, among which 109 proteins were up-regulated and 93 were down-regulated in the milk of HL yaks compared to TL yaks. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differences in skim milk protein between the HL yaks and the TL yaks suggests that the mammary gland of the HL yak is at a degeneration stage. Extended lactation is a common phenomenon in lactating yaks under grazing and natural reproduction conditions. To elucidate differences in milk protein compositions and mammary gland functions between yaks of standard lactation (TL yaks) and prolonged lactation (HL yaks), whole milk samples of TL yaks and HL yaks (n = 15 each) were collected from a yak pasture at the northwest highland of China. The iTRAQ technique was used to compare the skim milk proteins in the two yak groups. A total of 202 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were revealed, among which 109 proteins were up-regulated and 93 were down-regulated in the milk of HL yaks compared to TL yaks. Caseins including kappa-casein, alpha s1-casein, alpha s2-casein, and beta-casein were up-regulated in HL yak milk over 1.43-fold. The GO function annotation analysis showed that HL yaks produced milk with characteristics of milk at the degeneration stage, similar to that of dairy cows. KEGG enrichment showed that the metabolic pathways with the most differences are those that involve carbohydrate metabolism and the biosynthesis of amino acids. The present results highlight detailed differences in skim milk proteins produced by HL yaks and TL yaks and suggest that the mammary gland of HL yak is at the degeneration stage.

AB Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) notifiable, economically important transboundary, highly contagious, and an acute viral disease of small ruminants. The disease is caused by the PPR virus (PPRV). PPRV belongs to the genus morbillivirus of the family paramyxoviridae. The recent epidemiological and molecular characterization of PPR virus isolates subdivides them into four genetically distinct lineages (I, II, III and IV). The disease is endemic across Asia, the Middle East and African regions and is considered a major obstacle to the development of sustainable agriculture across the developing world due to its huge burden on the economy and development of the affected countries and has recently been targeted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the OIE for global eradication by 2030. PPR-endemic countries should join the regional force, and implement regional road maps for the progressive and successful control and elimination of PPRV. In this review, the regional epidemiology of PPR outbreaks and associated risk factors, including animal factors (age, species and sex), environmental factors (season, spatial distribution of disease in various locations) and trade associated factors with special reference to the PPR affected countries in South, Central and East Asia are comprehensively discussed.

AB The ocean is a very important arena in modern warfare where all marine powers deploy their military forces. Due to the complex environment of the ocean, underwater equipment has become a very threatening means of surprise attack in modern warfare. Therefore, the timely and effective detection of underwater moving targets is the key to obtaining warfare advantages and has important strategic significance for national security. In this paper, magnetic flux induction technology was studied with regard to the difficulty of detecting underwater concealed moving targets. Firstly, the characteristics of a magnetic target were analyzed and an equivalent magnetic dipole model was established. Secondly, the structure of the rectangular induction coil was designed according to the model, and the relationship between the target's magnetism and the detection signal was deduced. The variation curves of the magnetic flux and the electromotive force induced in the coil were calculated by using the numerical simulation method, and the effects of the different motion parameters of the magnetic dipole and the size parameters of the coil on the induced electromotive force were analyzed. Finally, combined with the wavelet threshold filter, a series of field tests were carried out using ships of different materials in shallow water in order to verify the moving target detection method based on magnetic flux induction technology. The results showed that this method has an obvious response to moving targets and can effectively capture target signals, which verifies the feasibility of the magnetic flux induction detection technology.

AB The yak is an important source for the people living and ecological environment in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In every winter, many domestic yaks will lose bodyweight or dead under cold and food scarcity. Moving the plateau yaks to farm in the plain is a useful approach to reduce their environmental stress and gain more production. In this study, we measured growth, slaughter and beef quality traits every month and sequenced mRNA expression levels of muscles of two groups yaks living in plateau and plain respectively. We found there is significant difference (p-value <0.01) in the third (60 days), fourth (90 days), fifth (120 days) and sixth (150 days) weights between subpopulations in the plateau and plain. We identified 540 different expressed genes (DEGs) including 123 known genes and 417 unknown genes. Using the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to build a co-express network, the modules were strong relative to weight traits. The findings highlighted the underlying way and a relative network to yield a new view about gene expression between the yaks living plateau and plain.

DE Aster batangensis; complete chloroplast genome; phylogenomics analysis
AB This study was the first report complete chloroplast genome of Aster batangensis (Astereae: Asteraceae), the perennial herb endemic to China. The plastid genome of Aster batangensis include 132 unique genes, with 87 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Among these genes, 21 duplicate genes, including10 protein-coding genes, 7 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes were detected. The complete genome size of Aster batangensis has a typical quadripartite circular structure with 152,605 bp in total length, consisting a large single copy (LSC) of 84,351 bp and a small single copy (SSC) of 18,212 bp, separated by a pair of invested repeats (IR) of 25,021 bp. The average GC content of whole plastome sequence is 37.3%, and the LSC, SSC and IR regions is 35.3%, 31.3%, and 43.0%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis by the maximum likelihood method showed that A. batangensis was closely related to the other members of Astereae (e.g. Aztecaster matudae, Conyza bonariensis, Lagenophora cuchumatanica, Baccharis tricuneata, Baccharis genistelloides)

AB The aim of this study was to improve the mechanical properties of a slag solidified body at high temperatures. Composite materials with different contents of SiC whiskers were prepared and characterized using techniques such as mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). When the SiC whisker addition is 1% mass percentage, the compressive and tensile strength of the slag solidified body after hydration for 7 days increased by 10.2% and 39.3%, respectively, and Young's modulus decreased by 16.8%. The results show that the addition of SiC whiskers can enhance the mechanical properties of solidified slag bodies at high temperatures. According to the test results, the hydration products of the slag solidified body mainly consist of honeycomb tobermorite (C-S-H) gel at high temperatures in addition to a small number of spherical products. The spheres are connected to form a dense structure; however, noticeable cracks were present. The addition of SiC whiskers effectively inhibited the initiation and further development of microcracks and improved the bearing capacity of the slag solidified body.

AB Soil macro-invertebrates play an important role in the decomposition process of soil organic matter. As the world's largest alpine peatland, the Zoige peatland on the eastern Tibetan Plateau is experiencing the decline in water table level primarily because of historic drainage. However, little is known about the responses of soil macro-invertebrate communities to water table decline. To address this issue, we established a field drainage experimental platform in 2013, which consists of low (50 cm deep drainage ditch) and intermediate (20 cm deep drainage ditch) water table level treatments, and the ambient (no drainage ditch) plots. In July (warm season) and November (cold season) of 2019, we examined the species composition, richness, densities and the vertical distribution of soil macro-invertebrates. Results showed that the species composition differed significantly among treatments. Species richness and densities of overall and different trophic groups (i.e., detritivores, herbivores and predators) of soil macro-invertebrates were significantly higher in the drained treatments compared to the ambient plots. Moreover, soil macro-invertebrates moved down to deeper soil layers in the low water table treatments compared to the ambient plots. In addition, sampling season (warm vs. cold) did not affect the responses of soil macro-invertebrates to water table decline. These results indicate that soil macroinvertebrate community is sensitive to water table decline in the Zoige peatland. Given the recognized importance of soil fauna to ecosystem functioning, more attention should be paid to the conservation of peatlands.

TI Algorithmic bias amplification via temporal effects: The case of
   PageRank in evolving networks
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION
LA English
DT Article
DE PageRank; Algorithmic bias; Networks; Ranking algorithms
AB Biases impair the effectiveness of algorithms. For example, the age bias of the widely-used PageRank algorithm impairs its ability to effectively rank nodes in growing networks. PageRank's temporal bias cannot be fully explained by existing analytic results that predict a linear relation between the expected PageRank score and the indegree of a given node. We show that in evolving networks, under a mean-field approximation, the expected PageRank score of a node can be expressed as the product of the node's indegree and a previously-neglected age factor which can "amplify" the indegree's age bias. We use two well-known empirical networks to show that our analytic results explain the observed PageRank's age bias and, when there is an age bias amplification, they enable estimates of the node PageRank score that are more accurate than estimates based solely on local structural information. Accuracy gains are larger in degree-degree correlated networks, as revealed by a growing directed network model with tunable assortativity. Our approach can be used to analytically study other kinds of ranking bias. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB While the proximate and ultimate causes of sexual segregation have been well studied over the past 30 years, most of the research has focused on species with a pronounced sexual size dimorphism. Species with a smaller size dimorphism are probably understudied, because the assumption is that aggregation rather than sex segregation should be the norm. We used 6 years of direct observations of goitered gazelles, Gazella subgutturosa, an ungulate with a small degree of sexual size dimorphism, to explore sexual segregation and aggregation patterns and habitat choice at two timescales. We predicted minimal differences in activity budgets between the sexes, based on their small size dimorphism, and did not expect any evolutionary niche divergence based on size. However, we found that goitered gazelles showed considerable sexual and habitat segregation for most of the year, and only showed a tendency to randomly aggregate during the peak of the rutting season. We also found that they segregated socially and by habitat and had different activity budgets in some months. Behavioural asynchrony and sexual differences in habitat use were much greater than predicted for a species with such a small sexual dimorphism in body size. Our study confirms strong multifactorial sexual segregation patterns, and points to the potential importance that social factors (aggression and territoriality) may have on sexual segregation in goitered gazelles.

AB We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to fully investigate the thrombocytopenia of platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors (PDGFR-TKIs) in cancer patients. Databases were searched for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) treated with PDGFR-TKIs until January 2021. The relevant RCTs in cancer patients treated with PDGFR-TKIs were retrieved, and the systematic evaluation was conducted. Nineteen RCTs and 3962 patients were included. Our study suggests that PDGFR-TKIs significantly increased the risks of all-grade (risk ratio [RR], 5.72; 95%CI, 4.32-7.59; P < .00001; I-2 = 32%) and high-grade (RR, 5.65; 95%CI, 3.28-9.75; P < .00001; I-2 = 0%) thrombocytopenia in cancer patients. Sunitinib is associated with the highest risk of thrombocytopenia among the included PDGFR-TKIs. The RR of high-grade thrombocytopenia varies significantly according to treatment line and median age. The available data suggested that the use of PDGFR-TKIs was associated with a significantly increased risk of thrombocytopenia.

AB Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays an important role in regulating the reproductive process of female mammals, mainly involved in follicular atresia and corpus luteum regression. DNA damage induced transcript 3 (DDIT3) is a marker gene of ERS. The objectives of the present study were to clone and analyze the sequence and tissue expression characteristics of DDIT3 gene in female yaks. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategy, we obtained full-length 507-bp DDIT3-cDNA, encoding for 168-aa protein. Yak DDIT3 exhibited highest and least identity with that of bison and horse, respectively. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that the expression level of DDIT3 gene in ovary was higher than that in heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, uterus and oviduct (p < 0.05). DDIT3 expression level in ovary and uterus during pregnancy was higher than that in follicular phase, luteal phase and fetus stage. DDIT3 was highly expressed in metaphase II oocytes and granulosa cells than that in germinal vesicle and metaphase I oocytes (p < 0.05), respectively. This is the first molecular characterization and expression patterns of DDIT3 gene in female yaks. These results indicated that the DDIT3 gene possibly plays an important role in regulating ovary function and pregnancy maintenance in yaks.

AB In this paper, a new class of set-valued inverse variational inequalities (SIVIs) are introduced and investigated in reflexive Banach spaces. Several equivalent characterizations are given for the set-valued inverse variational inequality to have a nonempty and bounded solution set. Based on the equivalent condition, we propose the stability result for the set-valued inverse variational inequality with both the mapping and the constraint set that are perturbed in a reflexive Banach space, provided that the mapping is monotone. Furthermore, some examples are shown to support the main results. The results in this paper generalize and extend some known results in this area.

AB Morinda officinalis polysaccharides (MOPS) were investigated for their physicochemical properties, monosaccharide composition, and immune-modulating effects in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, MOPS significantly promoted lymphocyte proliferation and increased IFN-gamma and IL-4 secretion. In vivo, MOPS acted as adjuvant, which significantly up-regulated HBsAg-specific IgG and IgG isotype levels, promoted antigen-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine (IL-2 and IL-5) production, and induced CTL and NK cytotoxicity. Moreover, MOPS increased DC maturation. Overall, MOPS can serve as an adjuvant to promote humoral and cellular immune responses via promoting DC maturation, suggesting that MOPS may have potentials as a natural immune-enhancing agent.

AB Peste des petits ruminant virus (PPRV) causes a highly contagious disease in small ruminants. The molecular mechanism of PPRV replication and its interactions with hosts are poorly studied. In other paramyxoviruses, the viral phosphoprotein (P) has been associated with multiple functions for key biological processes such as the regulation of transcription, translation, and the control of cell cycle. Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha) is an important process for gene regulation in host cells under stress, including viral infection. In the present study, molecular mechanisms associated with PPRV replication and viral interaction with host cells were investigated. We describe the ability of PPRV to dephosphorylate eIF2 alpha and the potential of PPRV P protein to induce the host cellular growth arrest DNA damage protein (GADD34), which is known to be associated with eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation. Furthermore, we observed that PPRV P protein alone could block PERK/eIF2 alpha phosphorylation. We speculate that PPRV exploits eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation to facilitate viral replication and that PPRV P protein is involved in this molecular mechanism. This work provides new insights into further understanding PPRV pathobiology and its viral/host interactions.

AB Ionic species are important to dominate phase separation behaviors of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) in aqueous solutions. Herein, photoresponsive azobenzene-based salts with various ions are prepared and their photoresponsive ion effects on clouding temperatures (T-cpS) of PNIPAm in aqueous solutions are explored. It is found that, despite of various structures of anions and cations, trans-T-cpS under vis light irradiation are always higher than cis-T-cpS under UV irradiation. Particularly, Hofmeister effect of anions on T-cpS is roughly observed. For example, azobenzene with kosmotropic CO32- gives the lowest cis-T-cp while in use of typical chaotropic anions, such as ClO4-, azobenzene isomerization less affects values of T(cp)s. In another hand, azobenzene-based metallic salts containing lithium, sodium, and potassium cations also demonstrate photoresponsive Hofmeister effect. Trans-metallic azobenzene demonstrates a chaotropic effect on T(cp)s while UV induces kosmotropic behaviors on T-cpS. Additionally, ionic conduction of the solution along with photoresponsive phase separations is also investigated and PNIPAm aggregations induce a sharp reduction of ion conduction during UV light illumination.

AB Using a reading comprehension task, we explored whether body postures would influence mind wandering, a universal internally self-generated activity. Specifically, participants were instructed to perform a reading comprehension task under three postural conditions (lying supine, sitting, and standing upright). Probe-caught technique with prompts presented at irregular intervals was adapted to measure the frequency of mind wandering. Self-caught method was used to measure the meta-awareness of mind wandering by self-reports. Results indicated that the radio of mind wandering was significantly greater in lying than standing and sitting, but the meta-awareness of it was not different among three postures. Moreover, the reading performance, an indirect indicator of executive control, decreased in lying compared to standing and sitting. We suggested that the increase of mind wandering in lying posture may due to the dysfunction of executive control, which also results in the redistribution of cognitive resources. Suggestions for future research are proposed.

AB This study aimed to clone the full-length open reading frame (ORF) of goat ANGPTL8 gene sequence, reveal its molecular and expression characteristics, and explore its effect on the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes. The full-length ORF sequence of goat ANGPTL8 gene was cloned by RT-PCR technology, and bioinformatics analysis was performed by related biological software. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of ANGPTL8 mRNA in goat tissues. Further use of RNA interference to study the effect of ANGPTL8 on the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes. The total length of the ANGPTL8 gene nucleotide sequence is 717 bp, including 597 bp of ORF, encoding 198 amino acids. Goat ANGPTL8 has the closest relationship with sheep, it was widely expressed in different tissues, and relatively enriched in liver. The silence of ANGPTL8 inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets by 5.76% in goat intramuscular preadipocytes (p > 0.05) and significantly suppressed the expression of the genes related to preadipocytes differentiation, fatty acid synthesis and transport (p<0.05 or p<0.01). These data illuminate the speculation that ANGPTL8 may involve in the lipid accumulation regulation via the control of PPARc and C/EBPb in goat adipocytes.

AB Nitrogen oxides (NOX) are one of the major sources of air pollution and can cause serious environmental issues. Herein, a series of CeO2 nanomaterials with different morphologies, such as nanorods, nanopolyhedrons, and spindles, have been designed and fabricated via a facile hydrothermal method as efficient catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOX with NH3. The as-prepared catalysts were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and temperature-programmed desorption. The high percentage of the exposed (100) plane, together with the small crystalline size of the CeO2 nanorods, led to more oxygen absorbed on their surface, which accelerated the adsorption and activation of NO and NH3, and lowered the apparent activation energy. Therefore, CeO2 nanorods exhibited the highest catalytic activity across the whole temperature range (150-450 degrees C) and obtained 94% NO conversion at 450 degrees C with high N-2 selectivity.

AB In this research, all the efforts, based on a series of molecular dynamics simulations on the interfacial process between VOC-contaminated air and acidic sulfate, were made to find how the structures and properties of VOCs are related to the formation of SOAs. The experimental fractional aerosol coefficients (FACs) were used to quantify the SOA formation and 14 VOC species were chosen based on the atmosphere inventory and the FAC magnitude. Finally, the quantitative relationship (QR) was found through the FAC as a function of the two variables the total valid interactions (T-g) and the diffusion coefficient (D), with R square 0.94. Meanwhile, the effect of water was explored and the QR was proved to be rational and reliable. The QR not only explained the SOA formation capacity of VOCs, but could also predict the SOA formation of new molecules.

DT Article
ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB As mobile phone is widely used in social network communication, it attracts numerous malicious attacks, which seriously threaten users' personal privacy and data security. To improve the resilience to attack technologies, structural information analysis has been widely applied in mobile malware detection. However, the rapid improvement of mobile applications has brought an impressive growth of their internal structure in scale and attack technologies. It makes the timely analysis of structural information and malicious feature generation a heavy burden. In this paper, we propose a new Android malware identification approach based on malicious subgraph mining to improve the detection performance of large-scale graph structure analysis. Firstly, function call graphs (FCGs), sensitive permissions, and application programming interfaces (APIs) are generated from the decompiled files of malware. Secondly, two kinds of malicious subgraphs are generated from malware's decompiled files and put into the feature set. At last, test applications' safety can be automatically identified and classified into malware families by matching their FCGs with malicious structural features. To evaluate our approach, a dataset of 11,520 malware and benign applications is established. Experimental results indicate that our approach has better performance than three previous works and Androguard.

AB We optimized the hot water extraction of polysaccharides from the root of Henry wood betony (RHWPs) using a uniform test and explored their anti-tumor activities in vitro and in vivo. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: 40 min extraction time, liquid/solid ratio 30 mL/g, 100 min soaking time, two extraction cycles, 100% ethanol concentration, and extraction temperature of 80 degrees C. The molecular weight distribution of RHWPs with MWs was 228,600 g/mol and 5001 g/mol. The IR spectrum further indicated that RHWPs are acidic polysaccharides containing pyranose and furan rings. The main monosaccharides found in RHWPs were mannose, ribose, l-rhamnose monohydrate, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, and fucose. RHWPs inhibited the proliferation of S180 tumor cells and induced apoptosis in vitro. Oral administration of RHWPs to tumor-bearing mice significantly inhibited the growth of the S180 xenografts, accelerated apoptosis in tumor cells, and expanded the necrotic regions. Furthermore, RHWPs also markedly increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2 in the sera of tumor-bearing mice, and activated immune cells such as lymphocytes, NK cells, and macrophages, thereby inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Taken together, RHWPs are a promising anti-tumor agent that ought to be explored further.

SO DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE snow leopard; genome-wide analysis; chromosome-level; olfactory
   receptor; genetic variation; odorant recognition; high-altitude
   adaptation
AB Olfaction is a complicated process that begins with the specific binding of volatile odorant molecules to dedicated olfactory receptors (ORs) in the olfactory epithelium and plays a pivotal role in the survival of mammals. The OR subgenome of the snow leopard has remained largely unexplored, and thus, investigation of the OR system would shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of the snow leopard OR repertoires and genetic evidence for environmental adaptation. In this study, we conducted genome-wide identification and characterization of OR genes in the snow leopard and compared them to all other Panthera species. A total of 213, 294, 624, 305, and 253 functional OR genes were identified in the snow leopard, lion, jaguar, leopard, and tiger, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships of functional Panthera OR genes were illustrated, which comprised 69 families and 350 subfamilies distributed in two classes (Class I and Class II). Comparative analysis of the five Panthera species indicated 115 shared and 5 snow leopard-specific clusters. The potential odorant specificity of certain snow leopard OR genes was identified by similarities to human protein sequences and we identified odorants such as eugenol methyl ether that had the most OR genes. Since our references for odorants were from human studies, possible odorants from snow leopard-specific OR genes need further investigation. The lowest number of OR genes for the snow leopard among Panthera species possibly revealed the association between OR gene family contraction and high-altitude adaptation, which needed further and deeper investigation. This systematic study of OR genes in the snow leopard will provide a solid foundation for further study of olfactory function and variation in the snow leopard.

AB Isostatic pressure of 300 MPa promoted the formation of strong bonds between fused silica pieces. The joining was performed using a 5 mol/l NaOH solution at room temperature for 20 min with and without an isostatic pressure. The as-received materials (with a roughness of 13.4 nm) joined with pressure resulted in a similar to 40% increase of the shear strength (from 12.3 MPa to 17.73 MPa). An even more significant effect, 70% increase, was found for the sample with a higher surface roughness of 0.10 mm where the shear strength was as high as 15.21 MPa. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and SEM suggested that the applied pressure promoted the formation of a strong bond. Unlike pressure-less joining, the joints produced with pressure retained their integrity after being exposed at 1000 degrees C. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Mechanisms underlying yak adaptation to high-altitude environments have been investigated at the levels of morphology, anatomy, physiology, genome and transcriptome, but have not been explored at the proteome level.
   Objective: The protein profiles were compared between yak and cattle to explore molecular mechanisms underlying yak adaptation to high altitude conditions.
   Methods: In the present study, an antibody microarray chip was developed, which included 6,500 mouse monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were performed on 12 selected antibodies which showed that the chip was highly specific. Using this chip, muscle tissue proteome was compared between yak and cattle, and 12 significantly Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs) between yak and cattle were identified. Their expression levels were validated using Western blot.
   Results: Compared with cattle, higher levels of Rieske Iron-Sulfur Protein (RISP), Cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1, mitochondrial (COX4I1), ATP synthase F1 subunit beta (ATP5F1B), Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase1 (SERCA1) and Adenosine Monophosphate Deaminase1 (AMPD1) in yak might improve oxygen utilization and energy metabolism. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase protein X component (PDHX) and Acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (DLAT) showed higher expression levels and L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA) showed lower expression level in yak, which might help yak reduce the accumulation of lactic acid. In addition, higher expression levels of Filamin C (FLNC) and low levels of AHNAK and Four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) in yak might reduce the risks of pulmonary arteries vasoconstriction, remodeling and hypertension.
   Conclusion: Overall, the present study reported the differences in protein profile between yak and cattle, which might be helpful to further understand molecular mechanisms underlying yak adaptation to high altitude environments.

DE Energy harvesting wireless communication system (EH&#8208; WCS); Markov
   fluid flow model; Performance metrics; reliable energy backup (REB)
AB Energy harvesting wireless communication system (EH-WCS) has the capability of harvesting energy for system operations from the surrounding renewable energy sources. However, the randomness and instability of the harvested energy will result in the depletion of the energy consumption. To provide reliable communication services with the quality of service (QoS) guarantee, it is necessary for the EH-WCS to use a reliable energy backup (REB) for supplying energy to the system during the failure of its primary energy source. In this paper, a novel stochastic model, i.e., the extended Markov fluid flow model, is proposed to describe the EH-WCS with REB. The Kolmogorov forward equations of the system model are derived. By solving the corresponding equations, we obtain the stationary distributions of the key performance metrics for the EH-WCS with REB, including the average energy consumption rate of the EH-WCS, the residual energy distribution, the average energy supply rate by REB, the packet queue length in data buffer, the data queue delay, and the packet blocking probability. A numerical example is provided to investigate the theoretical results, and the effects of the system parameters on the performance are further studied numerically. Both the theoretical insights and the numerical analyses are believed to be important for the design of EH-WCSs.

AB The transcription factor JunB can induce physiological or pathological responses to various stimuli, including immune stimulants and bacteria, and plays an important role in the immune response process. In this study, we identified a JunB family member in Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti), which was designated SpJunB. The complete coding sequence (CDS) of SpJunB was 930 bp in length, which was submitted to GenBank (ID: MN215886). SpJunB encodes a putative protein of 309 amino acids, which is highly homologous to JunB of common carp. The SpJunB protein contained a conserved JunB domain, and its 3D structurewas also highly similar to (77.61%) the human SpJunB protein. SpJunB was found to be extensively expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the spleen. The expression of SpJunB was significantly upregulated after Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) challenge. Prokaryotic expression indicated that a 51 kDa recombinant proteinwas obtained after induction with 1.5 mmol/L isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 h at 37 degrees C. The expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) after treatment of S. prenanti with the SpJunB protein. The activities of SOD, AKP and LZM were also significantly increased (p < 0.01) after the treatment of S. prenanti with the SpJunB protein. Simultaneously, the SpJunB protein reduced the infection rate of A. hydrophila in S. prenanti. In conclusion, SpJunB may improve the immune functions of S. prenanti. It will be beneficial to further study the immune mechanism of JunB in fish. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sacred natural sites are the unique landforms protected and worshiped by local communities for cultural or religious purposes. Although the traditionally-managed sites are suggested to have potential in contributing towards biodiversity conservation, few studies have examined the effectiveness of such sites on the protection of animal diversity. In this study, we used large and medium-sized mammals (> 2 kg) as representative taxa to investigate the potential for conserving biodiversity in a Tibetan sacred natural site in western China, where access was commonly restricted, but local monks and pilgrims occasionally scheduled rituals and religious worship practices as part of Tibetan Buddhist practices. We recorded 13 species, relying on a census technique of counting feces. The results showed that neither the species richness nor relative abundance of large and mediumsized mammals protected by the sacred natural site differed significantly from the surrounding matrix (i.e., the portion of the landscape surrounding the sacred natural site). However, there was a difference in the distribution of mammals between the sacred natural site and the matrix. The results suggest that carnivores, potential predators, avoided the sacred natural site whereas it is a site favored by herbivores. Although our study is from a single-paired site and the analyses are exploratory, the current results provide insights into understanding the potential for sacred natural sites to act as refuges for wildlife. Future studies that examine the role of such sites in cultural ecosystem service are needed.

AB A safe charging algorithm in wireless rechargeable sensor network ensures the charging efficiency and the electromagnetic radiation below the threshold. Compared with the current charging algorithms, the safe charging algorithm is more complicated due to the radiation constraint and the mobility of the chargers. A safe charging algorithm based on multiple mobile chargers is proposed in this paper to charge the sensor nodes with mobile chargers, in order to ensure the premise of radiation safety, multiple mobile chargers can effectively complete the network charging task. Firstly, this algorithm narrows the possible location of the sensor nodes by utilizing the charging time and antenna waveform. Secondly, the performance of non-partition charging algorithm which algorithm allow chargers to charge different sensors sets in a different cycle is evaluated against the one of partition charging which does not allow for charging different ones. The moving distance of the charger node will be reduced by 18%. It not only improves the safety level which is inversely proportional to electromagnetic radiation but also expands the application scope of the wireless sensor nodes.

AB The environmental input of a store brand product's green supply chain plays an important role in improving the product brand image and expanding the product demand. According to the difference of the initial one-off environmental investment of the store brand product, it can be divided into three modes: direct OEM, retailer's full participation and retailer's partial participation. The research methods employed in this study include model establishment, numerical analysis and comparison under three entrustment modes based on retailers' negotiation strength. In addition, sensitivity analysis was used to test the influence of parameter variations on the results. The research results show that: (i) the direct OEM mode is the best choice for retailers when the retailer is in a weak position, but it is not the best choice for the manufacturer. With the increase of the retailers' negotiation strength, the profits of both sides will decline, causing the problem of double marginal profit decreasing; (ii) the retailer's full participation mode is the best choice for the manufacturer when the retailer is in a strong position, but not the best choice for the retailer. It is not the best choice for both sides when the retailer is in a weak position; (iii) the greenness and total profit of the supply chain are no relative with the negotiation strength of the retailer under the partial participation mode, and the greenness and total profit of the supply chain are the same as the condition under the integrated control to achieve the best coordination effect.

AB Simple Summary The hybrid of male cattle (Bos taurus) with female yaks (Bos grunniens) is called the cattle-yak. All female cattle-yaks are fertile, but all males are sterile. To date, there is no clear conclusion on the mechanism leading to cattle-yak male sterility. The domain conservation and expression profiles of lysine histone demethylases (KDMs) suggest that they might play important roles during gametogenesis. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism for male sterility of yak hybrids based on two demethylases, KDM1A and KDM4B. The mRNA and protein expression of KDM1A and KDM4B were dramatically decreased in the testes of adult cattle-yaks compared with adult yaks. In addition, the level of H3K36me3 in the testes of cattle-yaks was significantly lower than in yaks. These results suggest that the male sterility of cattle-yaks might be associated with reduced histone methylation modifications. These results provide valuable epigenetic information regarding the molecular mechanism resulting in male sterility of cattle-yaks.
   Abstract The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism for male sterility of yak hybrids based on two demethylases. Total RNA was extracted from the testes of adult yaks (n = 10) and yak hybrids (cattle-yaks, n = 10). The coding sequences (CDS) of two lysine demethylases (KDMs), KDM1A and KDM4B, were cloned by RT-PCR. The levels of KDM1A and KDM4B in yaks and cattle-yaks testes were detected using Real-time PCR and Western blotting for mRNA and protein, respectively. In addition, the histone methylation modifications of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 were compared between testes of yaks and cattle-yaks using ELISA. The CDS of KDM1A and KDM4B were obtained from yak testes. The results showed that the CDS of KDM1A exhibited two variants: variant 1 has a CDS of 2622 bp, encoding 873 amino acids, while variant 2 has a CDS of 2562 bp, encoding 853 amino acids. The CDS of the KDM4B gene was 3351 bp in length, encoding 1116 amino acids. The mRNA and protein expression of KDM1A and KDM4B, as well as the level of H3K36me3, were dramatically decreased in the testes of cattle-yaks compared with yaks. The present results suggest that the male sterility of cattle-yaks might be associated with reduced histone methylation modifications.

By transforming the traveling wave system of the KP-Boussinesq equation into a dynamical system in R-3, we derive various parameter conditions which guarantee the existence of its bounded and unbounded orbits. Furthermore, by calculating complicated elliptic integrals along these orbits, we obtain exact expressions of all possible traveling wave solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional KP-Boussines equation.

AB Amanita neoovoidea (genus Amanita Pers.) poisoning leads to acute renal failure. Here, we present seven case reports of acute renal failure with acute hepatic failure due to ingestion of A. neoovoidea. Clinical manifestations included gastrointestinal symptoms 1-72 h after ingestion; elevation of renal parameters and blood uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels; a few abnormal hepatic parameters, primarily albumin decrease and alanine aminotransferase increase; and elevation of zymogram parameters such as cholinesterase and lactate dehydrogenase. To determine whether the hepatic/renal lesions were caused by amanitins, we analyzed the blood and urine samples of patients and specimens of poisonous mushrooms. Morphological and molecular biological analyses indicated that the mushroom was A. neoovoidea. However, no amatoxins and phallotoxins were detected in its basidiomata.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to survey medical staff's acceptance of online Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) during the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), and to know some information of physical and emotional response of those medical staff who worked at the forefront of COVID-19. through the playback amount of the online MBSR training.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Considering the working environment of medical staff in forefront of NCP, we designed and recorded MBSR audio album including 13 sessions, covering 24 hours of a day, then sent the album to medical staff who had been working in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. We collected the playback amount in each session on February 10th and February 24th, which were one week and three weeks after the album was finished.
   RESULTS: On February 10th and February 24th, there were separately 5778 and 10640 times of broadcasting. The highest broadcasting frequency session was at 5:00 am, followed by 7:00 am. The least broadcasting frequency sessions were 17:00 pm and 19:00 pm. The broadcasting amount in the 6 periods of the night (from 21:00 pm to 7:00 am) was significantly higher than those in the daytime (from 9:00 am to 19:00 pm). with a statistical difference. The tendency of the amount of playback was consistent, which was not affected by the specific content of the mindfulness exercises.
   CONCLUSIONS: Online MBSR exercises were well accepted by medical staff in the COVID-19. It may help them relax and reduce the risk of stress reactions. During the NCR medical staff may have different degrees of sleep and emotional problems, which need to be paid more attention to.

AB Cooperative relationships and interactive decision behaviors between online stores and third-party logistics (TPL) have attracted increasing attention from academics as well as practitioners with the development of the online retailing industry. However, the decisions and performance of each member in a decentralized supply chain are not in line with the actual performance and decision behaviors of them, especially when taking individual altruism preference into account. Hence, without considering the truism of channel members will lead to unrealistic decisions and obtain anamorphic performance of firms and the entire system based on conventional self-interested models. This paper develops an evolutionary bilateral decision-making model to characterize the effects of all members' altruism in an online shopping service supply chain (OSSSC). The model considers different altruism of each member in the supply chain and their changes at various intervals. The decision equilibrium and interactive rules of all members are deeply analyzed based on the evolutionary bilateral decision-model as the change of altruism of each party. Our results identify that: altruism preference impacts the decisions of all participants in the OSSSC system. When the TPL and the online store have high altruism and low altruism, respectively, both retail price and logistics service price tend toward low levels and all participants have high utilities. However, this situation is more favorable for the online store. In this case, changes in the altruism level of either party will adversely impact the utilities of all parties and the performance of the whole system; specially, when the online stores are self-interested while the TPL has altruism that fluctuates within a specific range, improving logistics service level will help to lower the retail price and increase market shares. Numerical experiments are conducted to examine and verify the results and some optimal managerial insights for online retailers and TPLs are provided.

ID SYNCHRONIZATION
AB The WebRTC protocol can provide live streaming of peer-to-peer connections via JavaScript (JS) application programming interface (API) calls to a web browser. However, the protocol is restricted to a small number of peers because there is no simple way to mix real-time streams from multiple peers and then distribute the mixed stream to a large number of audiences. For example, it is necessary to mix audio and video streams from peers in a conversation and broadcast the real-time mixed stream to more than 10k audiences who only watch the video. It is also necessary to blend synchronous content (e.g., logos, music) to the live conversation stream. WebRTC does not currently provide a mechanism to easily support these cases. This paper proposes a method for the synchronized mixing of real-time audio/video streams from multiple peers while minimizing latency. This method enables the implementation of an online live conversation system that is able to mix live conversation streams from multiple peers and then rebroadcast the mixed stream to a large number of audiences.

AB Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) infection is characterized by severe hepatitis. In recent years, DHAV-A has become widespread in Asia and has led to economic losses. Conventional methods of DHAV-A detection must often be performed in the laboratory with inconvenience equipment. We have developed a rapid reverse transcription insulated isothermal (RT-iiPCR) technique for the on-site detection of DHAV-A based on the POCKIT (TM) system in a convenient minitype device. We optimized the PCR primers and probes for the amplification of the DHAV-A 3C/3D genes, and successfully amplified a specific fragment of DHAV-A, but no fragment from 18 other duck pathogens. The limit of detection for viral RNA was 49 copies per reaction, and the sensitivity and specificity were each 100% in the analysis of 60 liver samples. By comparison, the sensitivities of RT-iiPCR was comparable in sensitivity to existing rRT-PCR. Furthermore, the RT-iiPCR results were 98.3% in agreement with those of the rRT-PCR, with a kappa value of 0.938. In conclusion, this new method not only offers a higher sensitivity and specificity than existing techniques, but also time-saving and better suited to field diagnoses because device is portable.

AB The discovery of new active compounds of natural products tends to be increasingly more challenging due to chemical complexity and unpredictable matrices. Forskolin is an active natural labdane-type diterpenoid ingredient widely used worldwide for the treatment of glaucoma, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma, and is expected to be a promising anticancer, anti-inflammation, and anti-HIV agent. In recent years, demand for forskolin in the medicine market has increased dramatically. However, natural forskolin originates exclusively from traditional Indian herb medicine Coleus forskohlii (Willd.) Briq. In a previous study, we isolated a series of diterpenoids including an 8,13-epoxy-14ene labdane carbon skeleton from Blumea aromatica DC. In order to identify alternative plant resources, a novel and effective strategy was proposed for the screening of potential forskolin-type diterpenoids (FSKD) compounds obtained from B. aromatica, using the mass defect filtering (MDF) strategy via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) approach. Within a narrow, well-defined mass defect range, the strategy developed could significantly improve the detection efficiency of selected FSKD compounds by filtering out certain major or moderate interference compounds. Additionally, the MS/MS cleavage behavior and the characteristic diagnostic ions of the FSKD compounds were proposed to be used in aiding structural identification of the filtration compounds. As a result, a total of 38 FSKD of B. aromatica were filtered out and tentatively identified. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that these forskolin-type diterpenoids were identified in B. aromatica, which significantly expands our understanding of the chemical constituents of Blumea species, and allows B. aromatica to be used as a potential alternative plant resource that contains these forskolin-type active compounds. The strategy proposed was proven efficient and reliable for the discovery of novel compounds of herbal extracts.

ID BLIND SEPARATION
AB Aiming at solving the issue of the robustness of sensor signal recovery as well as tackling the dilemma of simultaneous spectrum utilization, this article will concentrate on designing a robust wireless statistic division multiplexing scheme. The proposed robust wireless statistic division multiplexing transmits multiple sensor signals and shares the same frequency band simultaneously. The fundamental principle of robust wireless statistic division multiplexing is described as statistical independence or statistical distinction of the sensor source signals. An unsupervised learning mechanism named independent component analysis is used for robust wireless statistic division multiplexing receiving processing. The robust wireless statistic division multiplexing can not only contribute tremendously to enhancing the spectrum efficiency but also bring in attractive anti-noise performance. In this article, first, the fundamental mechanism of robust wireless statistic division multiplexing will be discussed in comparison with that of time division multiplexing, frequency division multiplexing and code division multiplexing. Second, in terms of robust wireless statistic division multiplexing receiving mechanism based on independent component analysis principle, a novel cost function based on minimization mutual information modified by minimum bit error rate constraint is investigated to improve robust performance of source recovery. Furthermore, independent component analysis-based blind source separation method combines with an adaptive moment estimation stochastic optimization for promoting the effectiveness of the source recovery performance. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness performance of robust wireless statistic division multiplexing.

AB A novel high solids acrylic resin (HSARs) with high solid content (78%) was synthesized from co-polymerization of the methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, acrylate acid, hydroxyl propyl acrylate, and hyper-branched macromonomer (HBM) in this study. The HBM was prepared by an A(2) + B-3 + CA(2) reaction system that covers four steps. The progress of each step of the reaction was monitored by real-time analysis for acid value and hydroxyl value of the reactants. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was employed to characterize the structure of HBM. The viscosity, mechanical properties, solvent resistance, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) of the HSARs were also assessed. Compared with conventional commercial polyacrylate resin with a 42% solid content, solid content of HSARs was increased by 78% and VOC was decreased by 40% due to the addition of HBM. Moreover, the HSARs resin possesses good solvent resistance and lower viscosity, which provides the possibility of decreasing the organic solvent when using them to make operational coatings.

AB TiO2 shows great potential as ideal and powerful photocatalyst to degrade and eliminate harmful organic pollutants from waste water. It is desirable to prepare anatase TiO2 with good aqueous solubility and photocatalytic activity for water decontamination. In this paper, water-soluble TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully prepared using polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) as stabilizers. The anatase phase of TiO2 was well controlled by introduction of HCl in the reaction system. The results showed that all the polymer-capped TiO2 were well dissolved in water and their aqueous solutions could maintain stable for more than 2months. The photocatalytic activities of polymer-capped TiO2 were evaluated by monitoring the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) with Degussa P25 as a control. The results showed that all the polymer-capped TiO2 presented better photocatalytic activity than that of Degussa P25. PTMG capped TiO2 exhibited the longest average lifetime of charge carriers, indicating the lowest charge recombination rate. Thus, PTMG capped TiO2 presented the best photocatalytic activity. In summary, PTMG, PEG, and PPG can be used as stabilizers to prepare water-soluble TiO2. PTMG is an ideal stabilizer for the synthesis of water-soluble TiO2 with good photocatalytic activity.

AB Heat dissipation plays an important role in improving luminous efficiency and reliability for light emitting diode (LED) devices. In this paper, a new thermal interface material (TIM), graphenc-epoxy composite, is synthesized and used for LED heat dissipation enhancement. Experiment is conducted to measure the TINT interface resistance, and the junction temperatures of LED with and. without such TIM are compared through simulation. The results show that thermal conductivity increases with growing graphene ratio and the interface resistance can be decreased by more than 65 % with the synthesized TIM. Besides, for the same graphene ratio in TIM, interface resistance drops considerably with increasing contact pressure. The case study indicates that junction temperature decreases from 72 degrees C to 67 degrees C for a 10 W power LED after using TIM, and such temperature difference becomes larger for bigger LED power. This work is important for practical heat sink design and optimization for LED equipment with TIM.

Herein, we demonstrate a simple strategy to asymmetrically modify the inner wall of a glassy biconical microchannel with silver, copper or gold by means of silver mirror reaction and polydopamine platform, respectively. And the bidirectional ionic current rectification phenomena were observed in all of the modified biconical microchannels. All of the modification methods are simple, facile and low-cost, and can be applied in the modification of other glassy pipettes.

AB Staphylococcal enterotoxins are considered as causative agents for staphylococcal food poisoning. Although newly identified SEM exhibits mild emetic activity in a cynomolgus monkey, but the distinct role of it in staphylococcal foodborne diseases has not been deeply understood. In the present study, the secretion of SEM in vivo from a clinical S. aureus strain SA004 associated with food poisoning was assayed. Like S. aureus strain SA004, SEM also promoted interferon- secretion into the blood of BALB/c mice and caused extensive inflammatory cell invasion, loss of epithelium, and villous blunting in the duodenums. The monoclonal antibody against it countered these detrimental effects and inhibited bacterial growth in mice. The results suggested that SEM might participate in triggering staphylococcal food poisoning via activating inflammatory reaction and causing intestine dysfunction.
   Practical applicationsThis study provides evidence for the biological properties of SEM and is in support of the in vivo biological activity of toxin-specific monoclonal antibody. In this experiment, monoclonal antibody against SEM could neutralize SEM in blood secreted by S. aureus, inhibit inflammatory factor interferon- production, depress bacterial growth, and protect the mice from duodenum damage. All these suggest that toxin-neutralizing antibody could offer a successful opportunity to block virulence factors in vivo.

AB 1,3-Diyne compounds are important inter mediates in organic synthesis, which are widely used in pharmaceutical chemistry, organic synthesis and materials science. A highly efficient for the synthesis of 1,3-diyne via cross-coupling of alkynyl bromides with alkynyl aluminium reagents catalyzed by nickel has been developed. The coupling reaction of alkynyl bromides with alkynyl aluminium reagents mediated by Ni(acac)(2) (5 mol%)/l,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane mckel(II) chloride (DPPE) (10 mol%)in 1,2-dimethoxyethane afforded the corresponding coupling products 1,3-diyne in good to excellent yields(up to 90%) at room temperature for 5 h. The coupling reaction of alkynyl aluminum with different substituents and alkynyl bromine with vanous substituents can afforded the coupling products in good yields. Importantly, the alpha-ethynylnaphthalene and 2-ethynylthiophene were also suitable for the reaction. This process is simple and easily performed, which provides an efficient method for the synthesis of 1,3-diynes derivatives.

AB An accurate region of interest extraction (ROI) plays an important role for both finger vein recognition systems and finger vein-based cryptography systems. In order to localize the rectangle ROI accurately, the edges of the finger and a line in the finger joint region should be detected accurately as a reference position. Because most of the existing finger edge detection methods do not work well, a robust finger edge detection method is proposed in this paper. An inner line of the finger is first detected to divide the finger vein image by two parts, after that two edge detection templates and a series of technologies such as interpolation, fit, etc. are used to detect and fix the wrong edges of the finger. Furthermore, considering that the shapes of the brighter finger joint region are irregular, multiple sliding windows including rectangle, disk, diamond and ellipse are generated, respectively to detect the reference line of the finger joint. Finally, a contour similarity distance-based method is introduced to evaluate the performance of various sliding windows. The experimental results show that the proposed edge detection method can 100% successfully detect the edges of the fingers in our finger vein image database. And for various detection windows, the ellipse window is more suitable for the detection of the finger joint reference line. So, the proposed ROI extraction method for finger vein images has a better overall performance compared with the other methods.

AB This paper proposes a novel control strategy for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system to investigate the potential of enhancing the stability of wind energy transmission system, a synchronous generator weakly integrated to a power system with a DFIG-based wind farm. The proposed approach uses state feedback to exactly linearize the nonlinear wind energy transmission system from control actions (active power and reactive power control order of DFIG) to selected outputs (power angle and voltage behind transient resistance of synchronous generator) at first. Then, on account of the linearized subsystem, the stability enhancement controller is designed based on linear quadratic regulator algorithm to contribute adequate damping characteristics to oscillations of the synchronous generator system under various operation points. The proposed control strategy successfully deals with the nonlinear behaviors exist from the inputs to outputs and improve the robustness with respect to the variation of system operation points. Furthermore, not only the rotor angle stability but also the voltage stability is enhanced by using the proposed control strategy. The simulation results carried on the studied system verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy of wind energy conversion system for system stability enhancement and the robustness against various system operation points.

AB Deep insight into the crystallization mechanism of amorphous silicon is of theoretical and technological significance for the preparation of high-quality microcrystalline/polycrystalline silicon. In this work, we intensively compare the present two plasma-involved routes, i.e., the direct deposition and recrystallization of precursor amorphous silicon (a-Si) films, to fabricate microcrystalline silicon. Both the directly deposited and recrystallized samples show multi-layered structures as revealed by electronic microscopy. High-density hydrogen plasma involved recrystallization process, which is mediated by the hydrogen diffusion into the deep region of the precursor a-Si film, displays significantly different nucleation configuration, interface properties, and crystallite shape. The underlying mechanisms are analyzed in combination with the interplay of high-density plasma and growing or treated surface. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report the fabrication and performance of a silicon-on-glass micro gas chromatography eight-capillary column based on microelectromechanical systems technology that is 50cm long, 30m wide, and 300m deep. According to the theory of a gas chromatography column, an even gas flow among different capillaries play a vital role in the peak broadening. Thus, a flow splitter structure is designed by the finite element method through the comparison of the velocity distributions of the eight-capillary columns with and without splitter as well as an open tubular column. The simulation results reveal that eight-capillary column with flow splitters can receive more uniform flow velocity in different capillaries, hence decreases the peak broadening and in turn increases the separation efficiency. The separation experiment results show that the separation efficiency of about 22000 plates/m is achieved with the chip column temperature programmed for analysis of odorous sulfur pollutants. This figure is nearly two times higher than that of the commercial capillary column coated the similar stationary phase. And the separation time of all the components in the microcolumn is less than 3.8min, which is faster than the commercial capillary column.

   Algorithm; Blocking Effect
AB In view of such difficulties as multi-objective, multiple constraints and the uncertainty of calculating parameters in product line scheduling, the multi-objective batch scheduling model considering the blocking effect was constructed. The feasibility and superiority of the algorithm in this paper are verified through carrying out a comparison between the model in this paper and the traditional assembly line scheduling. The research conclusions are as follows. The probability distribution model is established using discrete product coding way to enhance the quality of initial population. The application of restarting mechanism can improve the diversity of population. The blocking constraints occurring in the processing of adjacent machines are considered, and multiple lot-streaming flowshop scheduling model considering the blocking effect is taken into consideration. The solutions to the problem of obstruction are sought by using hybrid artificial swarm method. The global convergence of the model is enhanced utilizing the Pareto local search method. The original cross operator is improved with the information of non-dominated solutions and new generations are generated. The established model is compared with the traditional flow shop model. It is verified that the algorithm in this paper has fairly high global convergence and can generate high quality solution.

AB The fatigue associated with five newly approved vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) (regorafenib, vandetanib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, axitinib) is poorly understood. We conducted this systematic review to fully investigate the fatigue associated with these VEGFR-TKIs in cancer patients. Relevant studies of randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with the five VEGFR-TKIs were retrieved and a systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published until March 2017. Thirteen randomized controlled trials and 4395 patients were included. The current analysis suggested that the use of five newly approved VEGFR-TKIs increased the risk of all-grade fatigue (1.43; 95% CI 1.23-1.66; p < 0.00001) and high-grade (ae<yen>grade 3) fatigue (1.97; 95% CI1.44-2.70; p < 0.0001). On subgroup analysis, the risk ratio (RR) of all-grade fatigue varied significantly within drug type, but high-grade fatigue did not. The RR of all-grade and high-grade fatigue did not vary significantly according to cancer type, treatment line, and treatment duration. The risk of high-grade fatigue may vary with treatment duration, whereas all-grade fatigue may not. The available data suggest that the use of the five newly approved VEGFR-TKIs is associated with a significantly increased risk of fatigue in cancer patients. Physicians should be aware of this adverse effect and should monitor cancer patients receiving these drugs.

The effect of K/Na ratio on microstructure, phase structure and electrical properties was systematically investigated. The orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition temperature (T (O-T)) increases and rhombohedral-orthorhombic phase transition temperature (T (R-O)) drops simultaneously with increasing the Na content, leading to an R-O-T phase boundaries in the ceramics with 0.44 ae x ae 0.60. By tailoring their K/Na ratio and optimizing the sintering temperature, an enhanced electrical properties (e.g. d (33) similar to 438 pC/N, k (p) similar to 0.51, T (c) similar to 320 A degrees C, epsilon (r) similar to 2304 and tan delta similar to 0.029) was obtained at the ceramics with x = 0.56 sintered at 1090 A degrees C, which could be attributed to the preferably density as well as the R-O-T phase boundary nearer the room temperature. Therefore, we think that the KN (x) N-BNZ-BF ceramic is a promising candidate for piezoelectric devices.

AB Geometrical and electronic properties of GenV(0,+/- 1) clusters containing 1-9 Ge atoms and one V atom are calculated by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level and the LanL2DZ basis sets. The growth pattern behavior, natural population analysis, relative stability, electronic property and magnetism of these clusters are discussed in detail. The calculation results of the geometrical show that the relative stable structures of GenV(0,+/- 1) clusters adopt 3D structures from n = 3 to n = 9. The results of natural population analysis show that electrons transfer from the Ge atoms to the V atoms when n = 1-7 while the electrons transfer from the V atoms to the Ge atoms when n = 8-9. The Ge-n V- clusters possess higher stability and the Ge V-+/- 1, Ge-3 V-+/- 1, Ge-5 V-perpendicular to 1, Ge-7 V-perpendicular to 1, and Ge-9 V- have larger HOMO-LUMO gaps. Furthermore, the VIPs of Ge-n V clusters show a reverse trend in contrast to the AIPs.

AB In this work, (Ba0.96Ca0.04)(Ti0.92Sn0.08)O-3-xmol MnO (BCTS-xMn) lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated by the conventional solid-state technique. The composition dependence (0 <= x <= 3.0 %) of the microstructure, phase structure, and electrical properties was systematically investigated. An O-T phase structure was obtained in all ceramics, and the sintering behavior of the BCTS ceramics was gradually improved by doping MnO content. In addition, the relationship between poling temperature and piezoelectric activity was discussed. The ceramics with x = 1.5 % sintering at temperature of 1330 A degrees C demonstrated an optimum electrical behavior: d (33) similar to 475 pC/N, k (p) similar to 50 %, epsilon (r) similar to 4060, tan delta similar to 0.4 %, P (r) similar to 10.3 mu C/cm(2), E (c) similar to 1.35 kV/mm, T (C) similar to 82 A degrees C, strain similar to 0.114 % and similar to 525 pm/V. As a result, we achieved a preferable electric performance in BaTiO3-based ceramics with lower sintering temperature, suggesting that the BCTS-xMn material system is a promising candidate for lead-free piezoelectric ceramics.

ID PARTICLE SWARM; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB A novel quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the dual sub-swarm interaction QPSO algorithm based on different correlation coefficients (DCC-QP50), is proposed by constructing master-slave sub-swarms with different potential well centres. In the novel algorithm, the master sub-swarm and the slave sub-swarm have different functinons during the evolutionary process through separate information processing strategies. The master sub-swarm is conducive to maintaining population diversity and enhancing the global search ability of particles. The slave sub-swarm accelerates the convergence rate and strengthens the particles' local searching ability. With the critical information contained in the search space and results of the basic QPSO algorithm, this new algorithm avoids the rapid disappearance of swarm diversity and enhances searching ability through collaboration between sub-swarms. Experimental results on six test functions show that DCC-QPSO outperforms the traditional QPSO algorithm regarding optimization of multimodal functions, with enhancement in both convergence speed and precision.

AB This paper addresses improved stability results for T-S fuzzy systems with mixed delays and nonlinear perturbations. By introducing the geometric sequence division (GSD) method, the discrete delay interval can be separated into multiple subintervals with unequal lengths based on the common ratio a. Meanwhile integral partitioning method is applied to deal with the distributed delay. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is newly established with augmented factors and triple integral terms which are constructed by means of the length of every subintervals. In addition, in order to reduce the enlargement when we deal with the estimation of the LKF derivative, a free-matrix-based integral inequality, an extended reciprocal convex combination, and free weight matrices techniques are employed. A stability analysis of the delayed T-S fuzzy systems is presented with much less conservative criteria. At the end numerical examples are given to demonstrate the significant improvements of this proposed design.

AB The growth kinetics and volatile compounds of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on irradiated, cubed raw pork were investigated in this study. The results showed that the Gompertz model fitted the growth data of E. coli O157:H7 on pork with high R-2 value, and the growth kinetic parameters exhibited respective features at different temperature and inoculum levels. For the volatile metabolites production of E. coli O157:H7, distinct variations occurred after the middle logarithmic phase of bacterial growth. Indole showed a rapid and obvious increase at the onset of the static phase; 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone and 2-tridecanone followed the trend of bacterial growth with lag, logarithmic and static phases; the signal intensities of 1-hexanol and 1-octanol increased at the logarithmic phase and decreased at the static phase.
   Practical ApplicationsThe relationship between growth and volatile production of E. coli O157:H7 on raw pork would provide some fundamental scientific data for the emerging odor inspection technique.

AB Intestinal epithelial cells, which serve as the first physical barrier to protect intestinal tract from external antigens, have an important role in the local innate immunity. Screening of reference genes that have stable expression levels after viral infection in porcine intestinal epithelial cells is critical for ensuring the reliability of the expression analysis on anti-infection genes in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, nine common reference genes in pigs, including ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HMBS, SDHA, HPRT1, TBP, YWHAZ, and RPL32, were chosen as the candidate reference genes. Porcine sapelovirus (PSV) was used as a model virus to infect porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). The expression stability of the nine genes was assessed by the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software. Moreover, RefFinder program was used to evaluate the analytical results of above three softwares, and a relative expression experiment of selected target gene was used to verify the analysis results. The comprehensive results indicated that the gene combination of TBP and RPL32 has the most stable expression, which could be considered as an appropriate reference gene for research on gene expression after PSV infection in IPEC-J2cells. The results provided essential data for expression analysis of anti-infection genes in porcine intestinal epithelial cells.

AB The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) play key roles in growth and muscle development in mammals and some fish, however previous studies about the cloning, tissue expression and mRNA expression in muscle development of MRFs genes in Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti) was scarce. In order to know how MRFs genes were expressed in different tissues and development period, we cloned the complete CDS of the MRF gene family from S. prenanti for the first time, including MyoD, MyoG, Myf5 and Myf6. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that the S. prenanti MRF gene family has a basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that MyoD, MyoG, Myf5 and Myf6 mRNA was highly expressed in red muscle and white muscle. The mRNA expression of MRF family in muscle during different developmental stages (larvae, juvenile and adult) in vivo were also investigated. The results showed that MyoG and Myf5 expression in muscle were significantly associated with muscle development. Our findings provided molecular characterization and expression profile of the MRF gene family in S. prenanti and enhanced understanding about the MRFs in muscle growth and development in fish.

AB Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate pattern recognition receptors that play an important role in host resistance to pathogenic microbes. In this study, we cloned the coding region of the yak TLR family (1-10) genes and used bioinformatics to analyze gene characteristics. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TLR expression levels in different tissues. Yak TLR genes exhibited high homologies with other species. At the nucleotide level, yak shared more than 96 % homology with cattle and sheep and 75-87 % homology with human and mouse. At the amino acid level, yak shared 90-99 % homology with cattle and sheep and 64-86 % homology with human and mouse. Yak showed close evolutionary relationship with cattle and sheep, which formed a branch of mammals together with TLRs from human, horse, and mouse, among others, and formed a branch with a longer genetic distance with chicken. TLR1, 2, 6, and 10 and TLR7, 8, and 9 were clustered in 2 individual branches, respectively. Fluorescent quantitation results showed that TLRs were expressed in all yak tissues, but different members showed different expression patterns. TLR2, 4, and 6 showed the highest expression in the spleen, followed by ovary, small intestine, kidney, and liver. TLR1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were most highly expressed in the kidney and showed higher expression in the liver, kidney, spleen, and other tissues. Our results will be useful for studies on immune molecular mechanisms and disease resistance breeding of yak and other plateau animals.

AB Within the framework of the free-electron model, the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in FM/I/SF/NM quasi-magnetic tunnel junctions (QMTJ) is investigated. FM, NM, I and SF represent the ferromagnetic metal, nonmagnetic metal, insulator and spin-filter barrier, respectively. Our results show that due to the spin filtering effect in SF potential barriers, the FM/I/SF/NM can obtain relatively stabilized TMR in higher bias region when it has higher potential height and thicker SF barrier. And, for obtaining large TMR, the total thickness of the barrier region would be carefully selected as the influence of the supplementary I layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to manage Eospalax (Myospalax) baileyi (Plateau zokors) pests with physical method, the efficacy of four different arrow traps was tested to control the plateau zokor in Sichuan Northwest Prairie, China. Population densities of 39.7- 42.1 ha(-1) were found in the test plots. Such densities require control measures since pasture damages and economic losses are huge. Traps differed in trigger rates, from 83.8% (three-arrow type), 93.8% (infrared type), 93.9% (T-type), to 94.3% (one-arrow type). Capture rates ranged from 84.1 (three-arrow type), 91.8% (infrared type), 93.7% (T-type) to 93.8% (one-arrow type). The single-arrow trap has the highest efficacy and is also the cheapest, which is important knowledge for zokor control in western China.

AB This study has presented the complete mitogenome of Jianyang Daer goat (Capra hircus), a crossbreed known for its high growth rate and good-meat quality in China. The mitogenome was 16,643 bp in length, including 33.54% A, 26.07% C, 13.10% G and 27.29% T. It contained a non-coding control region, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and 22 transfer RNA genes. Two kinds of inititiation codon and four types of termination codon were identified. Moreover, most of the genes were encoded on H-strand. These information will be useful for further investigation on the genetic divergence among Chinese domestic goats.

AB Local CO2 laser processing was reported to effectively mitigate the laser-induced damage growth of 3 omega fused silica optics. Herein, combined with the experimental observations, the light intensification of repaired damage sites irradiated at different laser powers and beam sizes were revealed by using three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method. Two typical nonideal repaired damage sites, with raised rim as well as with concave rim, were discussed. Numerical simulation results show that crater with raised rim generate much greater modulation than the other one. With the laser beamsize increasing, the modulation for raised rim crater monotonously increases, while the modulation for concave rim crater increases firstly and then keeps decreasing in the following. On the other hand, the light intensification undergoes decreasing firstly and then increasing when laser power increases. Under the same parameters, it is shown that the modulation of the ideal Gaussian profile is the weakest of all. For the normal incident irradiation at 355 nm laser, the light intensity enhancement factors of the raised and concave rim can be as high as 7.13 and 25.04, respectively. To effectively arrest the damage growth and prolong service life of the optics, Gaussian-typed repaired damage sites should be introduced considering optics recycling. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Temperature-dependent reactions of molybdates with histidine in weak acidic solution resulted in the isolations of coordinated and uncoordinated products Na[MoAO3(S-His)]center dot H2O (1) (HHis = histidine, C6H9N3O2) and K-4(S-H(2)His)(2)(Mo7O24)center dot 16H(2)O (2) respectively. The former 1 can be reduced by hydrazine hydrochloride for the preparation of molybdenum(V) histidine [Mo2O4(S-His)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O (3) with dinuclear [Mo2O4](2+) core. The complex 2 shows strong hydrogen bonds between molybdate and histidine. The solution behaviors of the complexes were probed and compared between solid and solution H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra. Obvious dissociation of histidine in 1 has been observed for 35%, showing the equilibrium between the coordinated and free histidine groups. This may support the liability of coordinated imidazole in histidine with iron-molybdenum cofactor. Furthermore, solid CD spectra show 1 and 3 with positive and negative Cotton effects respectively.

AB To study the characteristics of the coupling vibration between the maglev vehicle and the track beam system, a new type of vibration test bench model was developed. Take the single maglev levitation frame as the study object, the structural characteristics of the maglev vehicle can be adequately considered in the research. Further more, the variable stiffness of the track beam makes the frequency conversion simulation possible. In addition, all types of real track irregularity excitations can be simulated through the test bench dynamics model. Based on the model, the influence of the track beam support stiffness, the track irregularity and the local support deficiency on the levitation control performance was determined using the dynamics simulation method, and the vibration resonance phenomenon of the vehicle/track system was reproduced by the dynamics simulation, too. The developed of the model can increase the research progress of the maglev dynamics research.

AB Kepone (chlordecone) is a persistent organic pollutant and may degrade to kepone alcohol. A fast and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) method using multiple reaction monitoring is reported for the accurate determination of kepone and kepone alcohol. Water and soil were enriched by liquid-liquid extraction and liquid-solid extraction. Good linearity was obtained between 1 and 100ng/mL with r(2)=0.997 for kepone and 30 and 200ng/mL with r(2)=0.996 for kepone alcohol. The recovery was in the range of 70% to 90%. This approach provided higher sensitivity compared to gas chromatography methods and avoided the formation of an artifact methanolic hemiketal.

AB In this work, we present a calculation of the p-bond energy in the SiH2=XHn system at the QCISD(T)/6-311+ + G(3df, 2p) level combined with an isogyric correction, which shows that PSub-DSSE (partly substituted divalent state stabilization energy) is a reliable methodology for analyzing the properties of doubly bonded species by separating the dissociation and substitution effects on either side of the double bonds. Compared to the pi-bond energies in the CH2=XHn system, those in the SiH2=XHn system have a better linear relationship with the electronegativity of the element X because of the improvement of the correlation coefficient from 0.802 for the former to 0.924 for the latter. This means that there must be another important factor that comes into effect in the CH2=XHn system. Through statistical analysis, the covalence difference between Si and X or C and X was finally selected as a second descriptor to explain the magnitude of the p-bond energies.

AB A frequency control approach based on wind power and load power prediction information is proposed for wind-diesel-battery hybrid power system (WDBHPS). To maintain the frequency stability by wind power and diesel generation as much as possible, a fuzzy control theory based wind and diesel power control module is designed according to wind power and load prediction information. To compensate frequency fluctuation in real time and enhance system disturbance rejection ability, a battery energy storage system real-time control module is designed based on ADRC (active disturbance rejection control). The simulation experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach has a better disturbance rejection ability and frequency control performance compared with the traditional droop control approach.

AB Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for sustainable energy storage due to high safety, low cost, eco-friendliness, yet zinc metal anodes face challenges like dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, corrosion. To optimize electrolytes, this study systematically investigates five zinc salts (ZnSO4, Zn(ClO4)2, (TFSI)2, Zn(NO3)2, and Zn(CH3COO)2) regarding zinc deposition behavior, interfacial stability, and electrochemical performance. Electrochemical techniques and multiscale characterizations reveal anion-influenced deposition and degradation mechanisms. ZnSO4 exhibited superior performance: symmetric cell cycled over 1700 h at 1 mA cm-2, Zn||Cu cell maintained 99.7 % of Coulombic efficiency (CE), and full cell delivered 76.7 mAh g-1 of average capacity. This stems from sulfate-induced formation of a stable Zn4SO4(OH)6 & sdot;4H2O (ZHS) interfacial layer, suppressing dendrites. However, localized H2 evolution can raise pH and destabilize interface. Zn(TFSI)2 showed low polarization and good stability at 5 mA cm-2, hydrophobic TFSI-may reduce surface impedance. Zn(ClO4)2 offered moderate stability, yet ClO4-reduction to corrosive Cl-limited long-term cycling. Conversely, Zn(CH3COO)2 and Zn(NO3)2 caused rapid decay: acetate decomposition produces corrosion accelerating CO32-, while nitrate reduction generates acidic species inducing severe corrosion and short-circuit. This work offers critical insights into zinc electrolyte design, highlighting the key role of anion chemistry interfacial engineering and cycling durability.

AB Chiral sulfilimines represent a type of chiral S(IV) compound that is versatile as pharmacophores and chiral building blocks for chiral S(VI) compounds. Herein, we report an efficient method of preparing chiral sulfilimines (up to 90% yield and up to 96% enantiomeric excess) from commercially available diaryliodonium salts and prochiral sulfenamides. The reaction was enlarged to the gram scale for the preparation of chiral sulfilimines and allowed for the derivatization of chiral sulfoximines and sulfondiimines with complete retention of stereochemistry.

AB Freshwater scarcity poses an escalating global challenge, prompting the pursuit of sustainable desalination technologies. Solar-driven interfacial evaporation with conventional graphene oxide (GO)-based photothermal membranes offers a promising solution, yet its broader application is hindered by the low evaporation efficiency and salt accumulation issues. Herein, we report a multiscale engineering strategy that integrates nanoscale and macroscale design principles to overcome these limitations through thermal-mass synergistic optimization, resulting in the development of a high-performance PGO-Ag/PVA-PAM hydrogel Janus evaporator. At the nanoscale, selective etching of GO nanosheets generates porous graphene oxide (PGO) nanosheets with in-plane pores that function as effective broadband light traps and accelerate water transport. Embedding Ag-NH2 nanoparticles between PGO layers introduces localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), further enhancing light harvesting and raising the surface temperature to 63.9 degrees C under 1 sun illumination, with total solar absorption reaching 98.16 %. Macroscale design relies on the PVA-PAM hydrogel substrate, which acts as both a thermal barrier and water channel, promoting heat confinement and ensuring robust salt resistance. Additionally, removal of the central evaporation dead zone facilitates vapor diffusion. This approach exemplifies the "less is more" paradigm: prioritizing structural rationality over material accumulation to achieve optimal functionality. The resulting PGO-Ag-H1.5 evaporator exhibits a high evaporation rate of 2.06 kg m(-2) h(-1) and a solar-tovapor efficiency of 91.93 %. Notably, it maintains over 1.0 kg m(-2) h(-1) performance in hypersaline conditions (15 wt% NaCl), producing potable water that meets safety standards. Practical applications confirm its practical viability, achieving a daily freshwater yield of similar to 7.5 kg m(-2). Beyond advancing the excellent performance, this work underscores the critical role of multiscale synergistic thermal-mass transfer optimization in the design of next-generation solar desalination systems.

AB Harvesting energy from ambient energy source is the key technology for self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to maintain continuous operation without an external power supply. Motivated by the expansion and popularity of 5G networks, we propose a novel solution for IoT devices which are self-powered via harvesting energy from the millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in 5G mmWave networks. For overcoming the high path loss in mmWave communications, directional narrow-beam transmission is adopted to provide sufficient link budget between transceivers through beamforming technology, which however makes IoT devices difficult to scavenge energy from the mmWave signals. Hence, we employ multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to assist in energy harvesting at the IoT devices and data transmission at the 5G users. Considering beam codebook design for 5G mmWave networks, this paper jointly optimizes the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based transmit codevectors at the 5G base station (BS) and the phase shifts of IRS's reflective elements for minimizing BS's transmit power, while satisfying the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints at users and energy harvesting constraints of IoT devices. Nevertheless, owing to the intricate coupling of variables and discrete constraints, this joint optimization problem is extremely non-convex and non-linear. To address such challenges, we propose a penalty dual-decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm which combines the penalty-based augmented Lagrangian method and block coordinate descent method. It explores the structure of the mmWave channel and performs a double iterations in which the joint optimization problem is decomposed into several simplified subproblems. Simulation results reveal that the above algorithm enhances the energy efficiency as compared to other algorithms.

AB Global warming driven by CO2 emissions poses a significant environmental challenge, prompting research into catalytic CO2 conversion technologies. Therefore, developing simplified catalyst structures with well-defined active sites is crucial for advancing this field. Herein, CeO2 and ZrO2 were chosen as catalyst due to their excellent oxygen storage capacity and redox properties in thermal CO2 reduction. Al doping was systematically varied to explore its impact on surface oxygen species and catalytic performance. Characterization techniques including H2-TPR, H2-TPD, CO2-TPD, XRD, EPR, TEM, and in-situ FTIR were employed to analyze the structure and surface properties. For Al-doped CeO2, XPS and EPR results indicated that Al incorporation increased oxygen vacancy concentration and surface reactivity, H2-TPR, H2-TPD and in-situ FTIR confirmed that Al incorporation increased H2 activation and HCOO-formation, leading to the enhancement of CO2 conversion. The AlCe20 catalyst exhibited exceptional performance with a CO2 conversion of 36.66 % at 600 degrees C and 100 % CO selectivity. Moreover, the AlCe20 catalyst demonstrated remarkable stability over 55 h of continuous operation at 600 degrees C. In contrast, XRD and XPS results showed that Al doping in ZrO2 stabilized the tetragonal phase but reduced surface oxygen availability, leading to decreased CO2 conversion. The undoped ZrO2 showed the highest conversion at 15.04 % (600 degrees C) among the tested samples. This work provides valuable insights into the role of surface oxygen species in CO2 conversion and highlights the importance of doping strategies in catalyst design.

AB In recent years, image-based feature extraction and deep learning classification methods are widely used in the field of malware detection, which helps improve the efficiency of automatic malicious feature extraction and enhances the overall performance of detection models. However, recent studies reveal that adversarial sample generation techniques pose significant challenges to malware detection models, as their effectiveness significantly declines when identifying adversarial samples. To address this problem, we propose a malware detection method based on an improved GhostNetV2 model, which simultaneously enhances detection performance for both normal malware and adversarial samples. First, Android classes.dex files are converted into RGB images, and image enhancement is performed using the Local Histogram Equalization technique. Subsequently, the Gabor method is employed to transform three-channel images into single-channel images, ensuring consistent detection accuracy for malicious code while reducing training and inference time. Second, we make three improvements to GhostNetV2 to more effectively identify malicious code, including introducing channel shuffling in the Ghost module, replacing the squeeze and excitation mechanism with a more efficient channel attention mechanism, and optimizing the activation function. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models, attaining detection accuracies of 97.7% for normal malware and 92.0% for adversarial samples.

AB Tibetan alpine grasslands (AG) serve as critical methane (CH4) sinks, yet face degradation from anthropogenic and climatic disturbances that promote subterranean rodents (e.g., Plateau zokor [Myospalax baileyi] and pika [Ochotona curzoniae]) activities. Although rodent bioturbation (e.g., burrowing, foraging and excreting) alters soil structure, soil physico-chemical properties and productivity from AG, its impacts on CH4 uptake remain poorly understood. Among the first, we combined paired year-round CH4 flux measurements from Plateau zokor mounds (ZM) and surrounding healthy meadow (HM) patches in Tibetan alpine meadow with collated CH4 fluxes from meta- and synthetic analyses across Tibetan AG, temperate grasslands (TG) and tropical grasslands (TrG) globally. We observed that rodent bioturbation significantly (p < 0.001) doubled annual CH4 uptake (HM: -0.91 +/- 0.08 kg C ha(-1) vs. ZM: -1.80 +/- 0.19 kg C ha(-1), mean +/- standard error, negative values indicate uptake). Notably, 67% of this net increase (-0.89 +/- 0.10 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)) due to rodent bioturbation occurred during the growing season. Meta-analysis results revealed this phenomenon associated with significantly (p < 0.001) decreased topsoil moisture and increased functional gene abundances of pmoA for methanotrophs. Non-growing season (NGS) CH4 uptake contributed 45% and 39% to annual CH4 uptake for HM and ZM, respectively, falling into the ranges of 12%-64% NGS CH4 uptake contributions from TG to AG of China. The TrG showed significant (p < 0.001) lower annual CH4 uptake than TG and AG globally, due to the fact that significant (p < 0.05) greater precipitation and soil moisture from the former than the latter. Our findings elucidate mechanisms underlying rodent-mediated CH4 flux changes and highlight soil moisture as a key driver for global CH4 sink variations. These results emphasise the need for long-term monitoring to better assess the ecological consequences of bioturbation in climate-sensitive alpine ecosystems.

AB An efficient synthesis of pyrroloquinolines has been developed via the aza-Michael/epoxidation cascade process in a diastereospecific manner. The domino reaction occurred properly to afford the desired tetracyclic indoles in 50->99% isolated yields. This synthetic protocol displayed especially broad substrate generality with respect to both indole-7-carbaldehydes and vinylsulfonium salts. Alkenyl thianthrenium salts were also tolerated by this protocol, affording a range of structurally distinct pyrroloquinolines. Indole-2-carbaldehydes were suitable reaction partners, as well, yielding epoxide-fused pyrrolo[1,2-a]indole with good isolated yields.

AB The development of green and efficient C & horbar;S bond formation methods has received significant attention from synthetic chemists because the C & horbar;S bonds widely occurs in many important drugs and natural biological compounds. In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer process. Therefore, this strategy has been widely applied in the formation of C & horbar;C and C & horbar;heteroatom bonds. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon sulfur bond promoted by organic photocatalyst Eosin Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

AB The increasing resistance of phytopathogenic bacteria to chemical pesticides has underscored the urgent need for novel bactericidal agents. Sophora flavescens produces a wide range of secondary metabolites with a wide range of biological activities. Here, eight prenylated flavonoids were evaluated for the activity against phytopathogenic bacteria. Among the compounds tested, sophoraflavanone G (SFG) demonstrated broad-spectrum activity, showing a MIC50 of 1.56 mu g/mL against Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Subsequently, the mechanism of SFG on Xoo was initially explored. SFG inhibited biofilm formation and metabolic activity by reducing the production of xanthomonadins and exopolysaccharides as well as decreasing extracellular enzyme activity and surface hydrophobicity. It also affected chemotaxis by down-regulating the genes involved in the chemotaxis of Xoo, which decreased the motility of the flagellum. Furthermore, SFG induced the production of ROS, reduced ATP generation, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and ultimately triggered apoptosis. Therefore, SFG is expected to be a lead compound in the development of bactericidal agents for plants.

AB This paper is devoted to time-space finite element analysis for time-space fractional parabolic problems with spectral fractional Laplacian under weak regularity assumptions. First, a discrete spectral fractional Laplacian is introduced based on matrix transfer technique on quasi-uniform meshes, and time-space finite element discrete scheme for time-space fractional parabolic problem is established using continuous time Petrov-Galerkin method and spatially conforming finite element method. In order to capture the weak singular behavior of the exact solution and improve the global convergence order of the discrete scheme, time-stepping finite element scheme is implemented on graded meshes. Afterwards, the well-posedness of the approximate solutions is discussed based on the continuity and coercivity given by Caputo derivative. In addition, the convergence analysis of the fully discrete scheme under weak regularity conditions is investigated by means of time-space projection estimates and consistency error estimate. Finally, a fast time-stepping finite element scheme is designed and numerical examples are provided to validate our theoretical results. Numerical experiments show that the error order is better than the present theoretical analysis and the use of graded meshes does improve the global numerical accuracy.

AB Background: Mogroside V (M5) is a primary triterpenoid compound originally from Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) C. Jeffrey fruit (SF). Notably, as a popular natural high-intensity sweetener, M5 has multiple benefits for human health. The increasing demand for natural and functional foods has facilitated the market development of M5 products. Scope and approach: This review systematically summarizes the studies of extraction technologies, pharmacokinetics, health benefits and food applications of M5, with special attention given to its underlying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the review identified current research limitations in safety evaluations, large-scale production and clinical trials and proposed future research and application directions for M5. Key findings and conclusions: Various different extraction methods have been exploited to obtain the M5 from SF, including solvent extraction, high-pressure assisted extraction and continuous countercurrent extraction. Column chromatography separation technology based on macroporous adsorption resin, anion exchange resin and octadecylsilane bonded silica gel commonly used for purifying M5. M5 metabolized in laboratory animals mainly undergoes deglycosylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation and glucosylation. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that M5 has extensive health benefits, including improvements in asthma, acute lung injury, diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, ulcerative colitis, neurodegenerative diseases and reproductive disorders, etc. The unique physicochemical and functional properties of M5 enable it to be applied as a sweetener, functional food component, cosolvent, and emulsion stabilizer. This review provides a foundation for expanding the applications of M5 as a food additive and nutraceutical.

AB Soil bacterial communities play a vital role in biogeochemical cycles and the sustainable functioning of grassland ecosystems. Plant community characteristics, such as species diversity, asynchrony, and ground cover, interact with soil resource availability, including temperature, moisture balance, and nutrient cycling, to influence soil community structure. However, the mechanisms by which plant litter regulates bacterial communities through plant-soil interactions remain largely underexplored. We examined the response of soil bacterial community composition to a three-year experiment that added varying litter masses (0, 200, and 400 g m-2) of three litter species (Elymus nutans, Kobresia setchwanensis, and Ligularia virgaurea) in an alpine meadow. Our findings showed that L. virgaurea and K. setchwanensis litter at 200 and 400 g m-2 significantly shifted soil bacterial community composition, although soil bacterial diversity was unaffected. Soil bacterial community composition was significantly correlated with soil and plant characteristics, as well as their interactions. Further analysis revealed that changes in soil bacterial communities were indirectly driven by shifts in soil available nitrogen and soil moisture. These changes were mediated by alterations in plant community coverage induced by litter manipulation. Additionally, changes in plant species asynchrony-either directly through litter-induced effects on soil available phosphorus and plant diversity or indirectly via increased soil pH-played a role in regulating bacterial community composition under litter manipulation. This study concludes that litter-induced interactions between plant communities and soil properties are important drivers of the soil bacterial community composition, and provides insights into cascading effects in plant-soil-bacterial interactions that support multiple ecosystem functions in alpine meadows.

AB Background Gut microbiota play a critical role in developing hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN). We previously found that sulfur-containing amino acid taurine (T) has nephroprotective effects in hyperuricemia (HUA) rats. However, the mechanism is still unclear. To investigate the underlying mechanism of T, rats were fed adenine and ethambutol hydrochloride for the introduction of HN.Methods Pathological changes in the kidney were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics analyzed changes in the gut microbiota and fecal metabolism, and in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the potential action and mechanism of T against HN.Results In vitro results demonstrated that T could inhibit NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and ROS in UA-induced HK-2 cells. It also improved renal function, ameliorated renal fibrosis, and reversed enteric dysbacteriosis in HN rats. These results showed that T protects against HN through the modulation of metabolites mediated by the gut microbiota. Meanwhile, gut microbiota included Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group showed correlations with nephroprotective profiles of T. The combined analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics indicated that the anti-HN effects of T could be achieved through phenylalanine metabolism, caffeine metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, retinol metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism.Conclusion These findings suggest that the potential protective mechanism of T for HN is not only related to altered metabolic pathways and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines but also to the reciprocal regulation of microbiota structure and metabolism.

AB Donor-acceptor type dyes are commonly used frameworks for constructing G-Quadruplex (G4) DNA fluorescent probes. However, such dyes frequently exhibit environment-sensitive characteristics and are prone to generate non-specific signals due to microenvironmental changes like polarity and viscosity, which hinders their application in high-fidelity G4 detection within complex biological systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to optimize these dyes and mitigate interference from environmental factors. Herein, we present a rational strategy for constructing environment-insensitive dyes through incorporation of tailored rotor moieties to enhance nonradiative decay, thereby sustaining a "fluorescence-off" state throughout complex physiological environments prior to reaching G4 targets. In the unique strategy, three novel carbazole-pyridinium architectures incorporating different rotor substituents (N, N-dimethylaniline, triphenylamine, N-phenylcarbazole) were synthesized. Notably, the architectural framework integrating the "low-barrier rotation" of N, N-dimethylaniline rotor (named ZXS) exhibited desirable initial "fluorescence off" state across a wide range of solvent polarities and viscosities. These features not only contribute to an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio but also effectively prevent the generation of false-positive signals caused by environmental variations. Upon binding with G4s, dye ZXS can be fluorescence elicited by its specific interaction with c-MYC G-Quadruplex DNA (similar to 225-fold enhancement). Especially, dye ZXS shows superior selectivity for c-MYC, exhibiting much weaker fluorescence response in the presence of other G4 and non-G4 DNA structures. Furthermore, it serves as a potential tool for the detection of G4s in the nucleus.

AB Investigating geological and climatic shifts in the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains (HHM) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is vital for unraveling environmental impacts on biogeography and evolution. We analyzed the evolutionary history of 3 Notholirion species across these regions, studying 254 individuals from 31 populations using 5 chloroplast DNA markers (matK, ndhA, ndhG-ndhI, petB-petD, and petL-petG) and nuclear ITS. A total of 1,145 low-copy nuclear genes (LCGs) and 112 chloroplast genes from 11 representative individuals were further utilized for phylogenetic reconstruction. Divergence timing was estimated with 147 plastomes, including 10 Notholirion populations. Fourteen cpDNA and 27 ITS haplotypes revealed species-specific variation. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed a monophyletic origin for all 3 species, with population-level nested relationships and cytonuclear discordance attributed to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization. Dating and ancestral reconstruction traced Notholirion's origin to the southern Himalayas during the Late Oligocene (25.05 Ma), with diversification commencing in the Late Pliocene (7.43 Ma). MaxEnt modeling indicated stable species distributions from the Last Interglacial to future projections. The initial split of Notholirion was triggered by climate changes following the uplift of the QTP. Subsequently, dramatic climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene and the complex topography of the HHM region jointly promoted species dispersal and diversification, ultimately shaping its current biogeographic distribution and phylogenetic structure. High genetic diversity likely stems from prolonged evolutionary history, sexual reproduction, and habitat fragmentation. The high genetic differentiation observed among Notholirion populations may be attributed to pronounced environmental changes across their distribution range, along with limited seed production and dispersal capacity.

AB The herbicide florasulam is widely used to control broadleaf weeds in modern agriculture. Although the general ecotoxicity of herbicides has been verified, their effects on non-target soil functional bacteria, e.g., nitrogenfixing bacteria, remained unknown. Herein, we investigated the potential impacts of florasulam on the nitrogen-fixing model bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii and sought to understand the underlying mechanisms. The growth activity of A. vinelandii was inhibited by florasulam in a concentration-dependent pattern, and the half-lethal concentration (IC50) was calculated as 8.21 mg/L. Surprisingly, the nitrogen-fixing activity and energy metabolism of A. vinelandii were stimulated by florasulam at 4-8 mg/L. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that the gene expression of nitrogen-fixing bacteria changed significantly after florasulam treatment. The genes encoding the iron nitrogenase and the key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) were significantly upregulated. Metabolomic analyses elucidated that florasulam inhibited the folate metabolism pathways on the third and seventh days, directly impairing the DNA replication processes and consequently hindering the cell division, which led to the reduction of biotin and riboflavin levels. Notably, the up-regulation of amino acid

AB VD3 is a fat-soluble ingredient, unstable to heat, and easily oxidized in air which limit its use and reduce is bioavailability. In this study, the performance of soy protein cold-set emulsion gels was successfully regulated by increasing the content of disulfide bond and hydrogen bonding through the effect of glucono-delta lactone (GDL) and transglutaminase (TGase). Optimal gel formed at 0.3 % GDL and 0.15 % TGase (w/v), appearing as a white soft gel. Its hardness and WHC reached (60.3 f 1.1) g and (86.1 f 1.7) %, respectively, 10.4 and 1.4 times that of the gel formed by only GDL. By SEM, FTIR, XRD and intermolecular interaction force tests, a more compact and stable network structure between the proteins was confirmed in this gel. Rheological and calorimetry experiments showed superior elastic behavior and stronger thermal stability.These emulsion gels were used as a new delivery system to encapsulate and deliver vitamin D3 (VD3). The experimental results indicated that under the concentration of 0.3 % GDL and 0.15 % TGase, the emulsion gel exhibited a higher VD3 encapsulation efficiency, reaching (86.7 f 2.0) %. Moreover, the emulsion gel had excellent temperature stability and storage stability of VD3. Additionally, VD3-protective effect of the emulsion gel was evidenced by slowed protein digestion in vitro. It released the highest amount of VD3 in the intestinal phase, at (55.5 f 1.6) %, thereby improving its absorption effect. These findings suggest that TGase can work with GDL to form calcium-fortified soy protein emulsion gels that carry VD3. It can be beneficial for increasing the use of VD3 supplements in healthy foods, especially for plant-based diets.

AB Societal Impact Statement(EN) Cannabis has been used by humans for millennia, resulting in diverse landraces and uses. Its complex legal status and economic importance make sampling wild-growing populations difficult, limiting past studies to modern cultivars with low genetic diversity. Our research provides crucial insights into the genetic diversity of wild-growing and cultivated cannabis. We identified three major genetic groups-E Asia, Paleotropis, and Boreal-shedding light on evolutionary relationships within the genus. Understanding cannabis genetic structure supports conservation, sustainable breeding, and informed policy decisions. These findings lay a foundation for future research, ensuring the responsible use and preservation of this economically significant plant.Summary Cannabis has provided important and versatile services to humans for millennia. Domestication and subsequent dispersal have resulted in various landraces and cultivars. Unravelling the phylogeography of this genus poses considerable challenges because of its complex history. We relied on a Hyb-Seq approach (combining target capture with shotgun sequencing), with the universal Angiosperms353 enrichment panel, to explore the genetic structure of wild-growing cannabis accessions and cultivars by implementing phylogenomic and population genomic workflows on the same Hyb-Seq data. Our findings support the treatment of Cannabis as a monotypic genus (C. sativa L.), structured into three main genetic groups-E Asia, Paleotropis, and Boreal-with clear phylogeographic signal despite significant levels of admixture. The E Asia group was sister to the Paleotropis and the Boreal groups. Individuals within the Paleotropis group could be further structured into three subgroups: Iranian Plateau, C & S China and Himalayas, and Indoafrica. Individuals from the Boreal group split into two subgroups: Eurosiberia and W Mongolia and Caucasus and Mediterranean. Hemp and drug-type landraces and cultivars consistently matched their putative geographic origin. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic patterns in cannabis and provide a framework for future research into its current and past genetic diversity.

   El cannabis ha sido utilizado por los seres humanos durante milenios, lo que ha dado lugar a una gran diversidad de razas locales (landraces) y usos. Su estatus legal complejo, junto con su creciente importancia econ & oacute;mica, dificulta el muestreo de poblaciones que crecen de forma silvestre, lo que ha limitado los estudios previos a cultivares modernos con baja diversidad gen & eacute;tica. Nuestra investigaci & oacute;n aporta informaci & oacute;n clave sobre la diversidad gen & eacute;tica del cannabis, tanto en formas silvestres como cultivadas. Identificamos tres grandes grupos gen & eacute;ticos -Asia Oriental, Paleotr & oacute;pico y Boreal- que arrojan nueva luz sobre las relaciones evolutivas dentro del g & eacute;nero Cannabis. Comprender la estructura gen & eacute;tica del cannabis es esencial para su conservaci & oacute;n, el desarrollo de programas de mejora gen & eacute;tica sostenibles y la formulaci & oacute;n de pol & iacute;ticas p & uacute;blicas basadas en evidencia cient & iacute;fica. Estos hallazgos sientan las bases para investigaciones futuras, promoviendo un uso responsable y la preservaci & oacute;n de esta planta de gran relevancia econ & oacute;mica.

AB The influence of grazing activity, specifically excreta deposition, on the positive contributions of soil fauna to litter decomposition was not comprehensively examined. We conducted a 660-day field experiment to test the interactive effects of yak excreta and soil fauna on litter decomposition and underlying driving mechanisms. We found adding yak excreta further increased the positive effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition. The strengths, and mechanisms of this promoting effects varied depending on excreta type and decomposition stage. The changes in litter decomposition constants increased by 116.3% and 98.2% with dung addition alone and both dung and urine addition, respectively. The time required to achieve 75% mass loss was the shortest (129% in advance) under the conditions of interaction between yak excreta and soil fauna. Importantly, our findings suggested that yak excreta regulate the role of soil fauna in litter decomposition through nutrient deposition of excreta, physical breakdown by soil fauna, and trophic interaction. In the early decomposition stage, the primary determinants included soil nitrogen and soil moisture. Conversely, during the later decomposition stage, soil carbon and soil pH became the pivotal factors. This study improves our knowledge of how grazing and soil fauna affect nutrient cycling in grasslands ecosystems.

AB BackgroundThe Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) offers one of the most extreme environments for yaks (Bos grunniens). The yak is an indigenous species, and the wild yak was domesticated on the QTP. The gut microbiota plays a vital role in health and animal performance. However, little is known about the progression of gut microbes in different age developmental stages of domesticated yaks.MethodWe used the 16 S rRNA gene sequencing method to explore the progression of the fecal bacterial microbiota of 18 different confined domestic yaks at two developmental stages: 3 to 5 years (GT35) and 6 to 8 years (GT68).ResultsWe found significant differences in gut bacterial communities between the two age groups. The diversity of the gut bacterial community was significantly lower in the GT35 group, which reached stability with age. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two dominant phyla between the two age groups. Phylum Firmicutes was significantly higher in the GT68 group, and Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, and Actinobacteria were highly abundant in the GT35 age group. Genera Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Anaerovibrio were abundant in the GT35 group. The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria Rikenellaceae showed higher abundance in GT35. The core bacterial microbiota of the GT68 age group was dominated by Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae. The gut bacterial community has a great variation between the groups. Based on the exploration of dynamic changes in the gut bacterial community at different ages, our results illustrate that yaks undergo a process of reaching stability and maturity as they age.

AB Multitarget inhibitors (MIs) against insect chitinolytic enzymes are potential pesticide candidates. However, currently known Mis suffers from low biological activity and limited possibilities for structural modification. Here, cryptolepine and its halogenated derivatives were discovered as MIs against all of four insect chitinolytic enzymes from Ostrinia furnacalis (OfChtI, OfChtII, OfChi-h and OfHex1) with K i values at mu M level. Notably, the inhibitory activities of cryptolepine can be increased by 1 order of magnitude through a simple two-site halogenation (CD-4). Molecular docking results indicated that halogen modifications may directly form halogen bonds with polar residues or change the electrostatic potential of the conjugation plane to enhance its pi-pi stacking interaction with tryptophan residues. Cryptolepine and CD-4 showed insecticidal activities toward both O. furnacalis and Plutella xylostella. Interestingly, CD-4, but not cryptolepine, prevents the formation of the protective color in P. xylostella by competing with biliverdin for binding to the bilin-binding protein. This study not only reports new MIs as insecticide leads, but also provides a new idea for pest control by inhibiting its protective color.

AB Climate warming and human activities are modifying plant litter inputs in alpine grasslands, which is predicted to affect ecosystem structure and function. However, the effects of plant litter removal and warming as well as the combined impacts on the ecological functions of alpine grasslands are not well understood. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of experimental warming, litter removal, and their interaction on ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) of alpine grasslands. Our results demonstrated a significant decrease in plant diversity (p < 0.05) and vegetation cover (p < 0.01) under experimental warming treatment, whereas the richness index (R) and belowground biomass (BGB) significantly increased under litter removal treatment (p < 0.05). The interaction effect of experimental warming and litter removal results in a neutralizing effect on the ecological functions in alpine grasslands. Meanwhile, the EMF tended to increase under all treatments of experimental warming, litter removal, and experimental warming-litter removal. However, there are differences in the response of aboveground and belowground multifunctionality to experimental warming and litter removal. The aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality (AEMF) showed a decreasing trend, while belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (BEMF) increased significantly (p < 0.01) under the experimental warming treatment. In contrast, AEMF and BEMF showed an increasing trend in litter removal treatment. In addition, the study found that litter removal could alleviate the negative effect of experimental warming on multiple ecological functions. These research findings can serve as a reference for maintaining ecosystem functions in alpine grasslands under climate change conditions and provide effective measures to enhance the capacity of grassland ecosystems to respond to climate change. The application of appropriate litter management measures and other nature-based solutions (NbS) to improve ecosystem functions, aiming to adopt sustainable approaches to address environmental challenges, holds significant importance for ecological conservation.

AB Membrane-less condensates (MLCs) are highly concentrated non-membrane-bounded structures in mammalian cells, comprising heterogeneous mixtures of proteins and/or nucleic acids. As dynamic compartments, MLCs can rapidly exchange components with the cellular environment, and their properties are easily altered in response to environmental signals, thus implicating that they can mediate numerous critical biological functions. A basic understanding of these condensates' formation, function, and underlying biomolecular driving forces has been obtained in recent years. For example, MLCs form through a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) phenomenon similar to polymer condensation, which is primarily maintained via multivalent interactions of multi-domain proteins or proteins harboring intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) as well as RNAs with binding sites. Moreover, an accumulating body of research indicates that MLCs are pathophysiologically relevant and involved in gene expression regulation and cellular stress responses. Here, we review the emerging field and explore what is currently known about the varied progress in LLPS of MLCs and how their features affect various cellular process, focusing on RNAs, including in skeletal myogenesis.

ID STATE ESTIMATION
AB This paper investigates the frequency regulation problem of power system with hybrid energy storage under uncertain cyber-attacks. Firstly, a switching model of multi-area interconnected power systems with hybrid energy storage under uncertain cyber-attacks is established. Then, a fuzzy adaptive event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the data transmission. Based on this mechanism, a non-fragile controller is designed in the sense of control recovery. Further, the H infinity exponential stability criterion with less conservatism is established by proposing an improved piecewise asymmetric Lyapunov functional method. Finally, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the frequency regulation performance. Simulation examples are provided to validate the proposed strategies regarding the effectiveness in economic operation. The results demonstrate that the developed control strategy has intelligence to improve the power system operation stability with enhanced frequency regulation performance and less communication resources occupation. Meanwhile, total energy consumption is reduced in the presence of uncertain cyber-attacks.

AB Objective: Cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector B (CIDEB), a family member of Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effectors (CIDEs), is well known as a crucial regulator for lipid metabolic signaling pathways in various metabolic tissues and secretory glands. However, its role in regulating intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in goat remains unclear. Methods: The expression vector pcDNA3.1-CIDEB was constructed and transfected into goat intramuscular preadipocytes; the overexpression and interference efficiency and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism were measured by Real-time polymerase chain reaction; the effect of overexpression of CIDEB and interfering with CIDEB on lipid droplet formation was observed by Oil Red O staining and glycerol phosphate oxidaseTrinder enzymatic reaction. Then RNA-Seq was used to investigate the metabolic pathway of CIDEB affecting adipocyte deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Results: Overexpression of CIDEB significantly promoted the lipid droplets accumulation and the triglyceride deposition, and significantly upregulated the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. After overexpression of CIDEB in goat intramuscular preadipocytes, 171 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found, including 122 upregulated and 49 down-regulated DEGs, and the top three significantly changed pathways filtered by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were Cocaine addiction, Amphetamine addiction and Malaria pathways. Conversely, the silencing of CIDEB significantly reduced lipid accumulation in goat intramuscular preadipocytes, meanwhile changing the expression of lipid metabolism genes. For CIDEB silencing, a total of 2140 DEGs were found, including 1252 up-regulated and 888 down-regulated DEGs, and the top three significantly changed pathways filtered by KEGG analysis were Ribosome, Thyroid hormone signaling pathway and Alzheimer disease. Conclusion: The expression of CIDEB can significantly promote lipid deposition of intramuscular adipocytes in goats, and these results provide important data to support further clarifying the mechanism of CIDEB gene on the regulation of intramuscular adipogenesis, and the IMF formation in goats.

AB Alpine grasslands have undergone severe desertification due to climate warming and overgrazing. Artificial reseeding has been widely employed for the restoration of these alpine sandy grasslands. However, its effectiveness in enhancing biodiversity remains unclear, particularly regarding the consistency of responses between aboveground plant diversity and belowground microbial diversity. To investigate the impacts of artificial reseeding on plant and microbial diversity of sandy meadows, we conducted field investigations in alpine grasslands of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that had undergone artificial reseeding, natural restoration, or remained as sandy meadows. The findings revealed that artificial reseeding yields inconsistent restoration outcomes for aboveground plant communities and belowground soil microbial communities in sandy meadows, thereby altering the typical relationships between above- and belowground biodiversity. Artificial reseeding significantly promoted plant diversity in sandy meadows, with the Shannon-Wiener index of restored meadow communities increased by 67% (p < 0.01), while its impact on restoring soil microbial diversity was less pronounced. Introducing new plant species through reseeding improved vegetation cover, plant diversity, and fungal richness. In addition, artificial reseeding altered soil properties, reducing soil pH by 0.35 units and altering soil nutrient content, which in turn influenced the composition and structure of plant and microbial communities. These results have essential implications for regional ecological security and the sustainable development of alpine meadows.

AB The content of selenium in environmental water directly affects the metabolism of organisms. In this work, the metal organic framework (MIL-125-NH2, MOF) was synthesized by microwave, and used as an adsorbent for the determination of selenium in water by direct slurry sampling hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (Slurry-HG AFS). By controlling a single variable, the pH, kinetics, thermodynamic and isothermal adsorption curves of selenium adsorption by the material were investigated. When pH = 6 and temperature = 298 K, the adsorption performance of the material was the best, and the maximum adsorption capacity of Langmuir was 78.77 mg g-1. Slurry-HG AFS for the determination of selenium exhibited good linearity (R = 0.9972), low detection limit (LOD = 0.92 ng L-1) and high accuracy (recovery rate: 90.0-106.2%), and high precision (RSD: 1.4-6.5%). The results indicated that this method has the advantages of reducing target loss, simple operation, high sensitivity and strong anti-interference ability, and was of great significance for the preconcentration and detection of ultra-trace selenium in water.

AB This paper examined the thermal gelation of yak myofibrillar protein (MP) incubated in a Fenton oxidation system at different pH values for 24 h. The effect of protein oxidation on the gel properties at different pH levels was explored by studying the water-holding capacity (WHC), solubility, texture, and other characteristics, while the chemical force, rheological, and microstructural variation in these conditions were analyzed. The results showed that protein oxidation negatively impacted the yak meat MP gel characteristics (p < 0.05). Increasing the H2O2 interval at different pH levels significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the WHC, solubility, and texture of the protein gel, the average reduction was 7.5%, 27.5%, 12.5% respectively. The H2O2 concentration and pH level substantially affected ionic and hydrogen bond formation (p < 0.05). Oxidation had the most obvious impact on the gel characteristics at pH 5.0. The MP gel displayed a loose, disordered microstructure with the lowest WHC, textural strength, storage modulus (G'), and intermolecular protein force. Oxidation had the least impact on the gel properties at pH 6.0. The MP gel exhibited the highest textural strength, G', and intermolecular forces, characterized by a compact, orderly microstructure with small, uniformly distributed pores. The gel displayed the best WHC after oxidation at pH 8.0.

TI Context-aware prompting for LLM-based program repair
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE APR; LLMs; Repair directions; Adaptive context selection
AB Automated program repair (APR) plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality of software code, as manual bug-fixing is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. Traditional APR tools (e.g., template-based approaches) face the challenge of generalizing to different bug patterns, while deep learning (DL)-based methods heavily rely on training datasets and struggle to fix unseen bugs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in APR due to their ability to generate patches, having achieved promising results. However, their effectiveness is still constrained by the casually-determined context (e.g., being unable to adaptively select the specific context according to the situation of each defect). Therefore, a more effective APR approach is highly needed, which provides more precise and comprehensive context for the given defect to enhance the robustness of LLM-based APRs. In this paper, we propose a context-aware APR approach named CodeCorrector, which designs a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach to follow developers' program repair behaviors. Given a failing test and its buggy file, CodeCorrector first analyzes why the test fails based on the failure message to infer repair direction; then selects the relevant context information to this repair direction; finally builds the context-aware repair prompt to guide LLMs for patch generation. Our motivation is to offer a novel perspective for enhancing LLM-based program repair through context-aware prompting, which adaptively selects specific context for a given defect. The evaluation on the widely-used Defects4J (i.e., v1.2 and v2.0) benchmark shows that overall, by executing a small number of repairs (i.e., as few as ten rounds), CodeCorrector outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines on the more complex defects in Defects4J v2.0 and the defects without fine-grained defect localization information in Defects4J v1.2. Specifically, a total of 38 defects are fixed by only CodeCorrector. We further analyze the contributions of two core components (i.e., repair directions, global context selection) to the performance of CodeCorrector, especially repair directions, which improve CodeCorrector by 112% in correct patches and 78% in plausible patches on Defects4J v1.2. Moreover, CodeCorrector generates more valid and correct patches, achieving a 377% improvement over the base LLM GPT-3.5 and a 268% improvement over GPT-4.

ID RISK-ASSESSMENT; HUMAN HEALTH; BIOAVAILABILITY
AB Naore Village in Shuang'an Township, China is a rare high-Se area where incidents of Se poisoning have occurred due to the consumption of locally grown crops with high Se level. To study the content and speciation of Se in crops from Se poisoning area, a total of 95 crops samples, including 11 types of the most commonly consumed local crops, were collected in Naore Village and its surrounding areas. The contents of total Se (tSe), organic Se (orgSe), inorganic Se (inorgSe), and major enzyme-soluble Se species (SeMet, SeCys2, MeSeCys, SeEt, Se(IV), and Se(VI)) in crop samples were analyzed. The results are as followed: 1) The tSe content in crops ranged from 0.008 to 165.645 mg center dot kg- 1, with an average of 5.362 mg center dot kg- 1. The tSe content within the same type of crop varied greatly, with the maximum and minimum values differing by up to 1205.57 times (in maize). 2) Different type of crops exhibited varying abilities to accumulate Se, with pakchoi showing the strongest accumulation (165.465 mg center dot kg- 1 at Se poisoning site). 3) The predominant form of Se in crops was orgSe, with 95.88 % of crops having orgSe accounting for over 50 % of the tSe content. The predominant form of orgSe in crops was SeMet. 4) Consuming locally produced grains and vegetables with high Se level can lead to excessive daily Se intake. The long-term dependence on locally grown crops could increase the risk of Se poisoning. 5) At Se poisoning site, where Se poisoning cases once occurred, the intake of orgSe from locally produced grain and pakchoi exceeds the tolerable limit. The safety of orgSe may be overestimated. Our findings are expected to enhance the understanding of the potential risk of orgSe and provide a basis for the reasonable dietary intake of orgSe.

AB Recent research on yak milk has revealed that it is an alternative to cow milk as another high-quality milk source for infant formula milk powder; however, the differences in the lipid profiles of human and yak milk are not yet clear. In this study, the lipidome and fatty acid composition of milk samples were analyzed and compared. We identified 298 lipid molecular species and 169 lipid molecular species that were significantly different in positive and negative ion modes. Yak milk showed significant differences in the contents of most triglycerides (TG), diacylglycerols, and polar lipid species compared with human milk, especially TG (14:0/14:0/15:0) and TG (12:0/16:0/17:0), which were more abundant in yak milk and were mainly related to glycerolipid metabolism. The potential biomarkers we discovered did not include PUFA. This comprehensive analysis will hopefully aid in the design of infant formulas using yak milk.

AB Rational design of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets through combined elemental doping and defect functionalization to optimize the photocatalytic performance remains a promising yet challenging strategy. In this study, sulfur/oxygen atoms and vacancy defects were engineered sequentially in CN nanosheets (CN-SO-v) through a dual approach of thermal polymerization and oxidative etching. The as-prepared CN-SO-v exhibiting atomically thin nanosheet architecture exposed abundant active sites accessible for catalytic processes. Under visible light irradiation, CN-SO-v exhibited exceptional photocatalytic activity, achieving complete degradation of tetracycline by 99.1% within just 15 min. The kinetics rate constant of CN-SO-v was 9.1 times higher than that of pristine CN. DFT calculations revealed that the incorporation of sulfur into CN induced lattice distortions attributed to its large atomic size and electron donor. The synergistic effects of defect engineering and co-doping promoted photogenerated exciton formation while substantially enhancing charge separation efficiency.

AB Selenium-enriched yeast (SeY), a high-quality organic source of selenium, enhances antioxidant activity and intestinal health in swine. This study aims to evaluate the effects of varying dietary SeY levels on intestinal morphology, epithelial mucus production, antioxidant activity, and colonic bacterial communities in growing-finishing pigs. Thirty 90-day-old DurocxLandracexYorkshire growing-finishing pigs (average body weight of 54.37 +/- 2.13 kg) were randomly assigned to five treatment groups. The control group (CON) was fed a basal diet, while the other four groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with SeY at 0.3, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg, respectively, for an 80-day of feeding trial. The results showed that the addition of SeY at 0.3 mg/kg increased villus height, villus height/crypt ratio, and mucus production in the ileum, as evidenced by the increase in goblet cell number and mucus thickness (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 0.3 mg/kg SeY up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of the MUC-1, claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1 genes (P < 0.05). In contrast, high-dose SeY at 5 mg/kg resulting in damage to mucosal morphology. Ileal antioxidant activity of SOD and GSH-Px, and jejunal mRNA expression of GPX-1 and GPX-4, were higher in response to SeY (P < 0.05). Faecal Se excretion increased in SeY groups in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). SeY led to a significant difference in beta diversity among treatment groups (P = 0.002) and led to a significant decrease in the concentrations of isobutyric and isovaleric acids when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The acetate, propionate, butyrate, and total short-chain fatty acids were positively correlated with the biomarker genera Agathobacter (SeY at 0.3mg/kg), while isobutyrate and isovalerate were negatively correlated with biomarker genera Lactobacillus (SeY at 0.3mg/kg) (P < 0.05). Faecal accumulation of Se was positively correlated with the biomarker genera Alloprevotella (SeY at 3mg/kg) and Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 (SeY at 5mg/kg) and was negatively correlated with biomarker genera Agathobacter (SeY at 0.3mg/kg), Bacteroides (CON), and Faecalibacterium (CON) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, SeY doses of 0.3 mg/kg have beneficial effects on intestinal health, whereas prolonged SeY doses up to 5 mg/kg may compromise the intestinal mucus function in growing-finishing pigs.

AB Since 2017, goose astrovirus (GoAstV) has been widely prevalent in various provinces of China, causing economic losses in the goose industry, with outbreak mortality rates ranging from 10 to 60%. Notably, a goose farm in Sichuan Province has faced an outbreak of infectious disease in 1-3 weeks old goslings, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples identified Goose astrovirus genotype 1 (GoAstV-1), and PCR analysis confirmed the presence of GoAstV-1. Furthermore, we successfully isolated a GoAstV-C1 strain using goose embryos named AAstV/Goose/CHN/2023/C1 (GenBank No. PP108251), and its viral titer was calculated as 10<^>4.834 ELD50/0.5 mL using the Reed-Muench method. The genome size of GoAstV-C1 was about 7,261 nucleotides through amplifying with Sanger sequencing and assembling with SeqMan software. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GoAstV-1 strains are classified into three major subtypes: A, B, and C, with the GoAstV-C1 strain identified as a unique variant within subtype B, characterized by distinct genetic divergence features. Experimental inoculation of one-day-old goslings with the virus resulted in a mortality rate of 5 out of 15 (p-value = 0.0421) and a significant reduction in weight gain compared to controls (p-value = 0.005). Pathological examination revealed that GoAstV-C1 infection caused severe damage to the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Interestingly, unlike most GoAstV, which leads to characteristic gout symptoms, our isolates GoAstV-C1 caused obvious intestinal damage characterized by necrosis, inflammatory infiltration, and crypt architectural disruption. We indicated that GoAstV-C1 displays a unique intestinal tropism rather than characteristic gout symptoms and elucidated genomic features and evolutionary relationships of GoAstV strains. These findings help advance our knowledge of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of GoAstV-1, and the predicted structure of capsid protein could serve as a potential target for designing novel antiviral drugs or vaccines against GoAstV-1.

AB In this article, the synchronization issue of Markovian neural networks with reaction-diffusion phenomena (RDMNNs) in complex noise environments is studied. Firstly, L & eacute;vy noise is incorporated into the model as the stochastic noise source for the system, and the impact of different noise intensities on the stability of the error system is analyzed. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in system parameters are analyzed using Markovian switching theory. Secondly, a Time-Space sampled control (TSSC) strategy is adopted, which integrates time and space dimensional information to address the challenges of diffusion phenomena. This control strategy expands the control dimensions of the controller and enhances the efficiency of system information utilization. Subsequently, an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed and It & ocirc; formula is employed to derive a less conservative synchronization criterion for both the master and slave systems. In the end, a numerical example is given to verify and support the validity of the theoretical result obtained from the derivation.

AB Pasteurella multocida is one of the most important pathogens that infect goats, causing serious economic losses in the goat breeding industry. To understand the biological characteristics of P. multocida from goats, a comprehensive characterization of bacteria isolated from 342 nasal swabs and 8 lung tissue samples from goat farms in Sichuan, China, was performed. A total of 34 isolates were assigned to one capsular type, D, and one lipopolysaccharide (LPS) genotype, L3, indicating that the D: L3 was the predominant serotype in goat farms. In the 34 isolates, multiple virulence-related genes were identified, with a detection rate of 100 % (34/34) for the genes ompA, ompH, oma87, exbB, and exbD. It is noteworthy that the prevalence of the toxA gene, which encodes the P. multocida toxin (PMT), was found to be 85.2 % (29/34). Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated a high prevalence of multidrug resistance, with resistance rates of 41.1 % for ampicillin, 38.2 % for tetracycline, and 32.3 % for kanamycin. Overall, this study provides a foundational understanding of the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of P. multocida in goats, offering insights for future prevention and control measures.

AB Phosphorus (P) and water are essential for plant growth and development, exerting a significant influence on global crop production. The phosphate transporter (PHT) gene family plays a pivotal role in phosphate (Pi) uptake, transport, and homeostasis under diverse environmental conditions. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide identification and characterization of the PHT gene family in Avena sativa. A total of 32 non-redundant AsPHT genes were identified in the OT3098 genome, classified into two subfamilies: AsPHT1 (21 genes) and AsPHO (11 genes). AsPHT1 proteins were predominantly hydrophobic with one or two exons, whereas AsPHO proteins were hydrophilic, exhibiting a more complex structure with 13-15 exons. Cis-regulatory element analysis revealed an abundance of hormone- and stress-responsive elements in the promoters of AsPHT genes, indicating their potential roles in adaptive responses to Pi and water deficiency. Gene expression profiling under low Pi and drought conditions demonstrated differential expression of 22 AsPHT genes in roots and leaves at the seedling stage, with distinct responses to the two stresses, highlighting the functional diversity of the AsPHT gene family. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Pi and water acquisition in oats and offer potential applications for developing varieties with enhanced Pi use efficiency and drought tolerance.

AB Objective: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the regulation of lipid deposition in animals, but there are few reports on key circRNAs regulating intramuscular adipocyte differentiation in goats. Therefore, this study took an abundantly expressed in goat adipocytes chi-circ_0009659 as the object. Methods: Based on the identification of back splicing site in chi-circ_0009659, its expression level during the goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) . The chi-circ_0009659 loss-of-function and gain-of-function cell models were obtained by adenovirus and smarter silencer, respectively. and the adipocyte differentiation were explored by Oil Red O staining, Bodipy staining and qPCR. Its major cytoplasmic localization was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), nucleocytoplasmic separation and qPCR. The interaction between chi-circ_0009659, miR-3431-5p, and STEAP family member 4 (STEAP4) was verified by bioinformatics, RNA pull down and dual luciferase reporter assay. Results: Silencing chi-circ_0009659 inhibited lipid droplet accumulation and the expression of differentiation-determining genes in goat intramuscular adipocytes, while overexpression of chi-circ_0009659 reversed these results. chi-circ_0009659 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm and could regulate miR-3431 expression which in turn affects STEAP4. Consistent with expectations, miR-3431-5p acted as a negative regulator of GIMPA differentiation, while STEAP4 promoted differentiation. Conclusion: We demonstrated chi-circ_0009659 positively regulates goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation by sponging miR-3431-5p to further regulate the expression of STEAP4. This research provides a new reference for in-depth understanding of the effects of circRNA on adipocyte differentiation.

AB Growth traits are crucial for poultry breeding and production. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS) of growth traits require a substantial number of accurate genetic markers. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body size traits was performed on 248 Luning chickens to identify significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs) related to the growth and development of chickens. A total of 30 significant SNPs and 13 INDELs were obtained for body size traits. Two notable regions, spanning from 43.072 to 43.219 Mb on chromosome 1 and from 4.751 to 4.800 Mb on chromosome 11, were found to be significantly associated with growth traits in the GWAS of both SNPs and INDELs. Some genes, including PPFIA2, KITLG, DUSP6, TOX3, MTNR1B, FAT3, PTPRR, VEZT, BBS9, and CYLD, were identified as important candidate genes for the growth of chickens. The results provide valuable information for understanding the genetic basis of growth traits which is beneficial for the subsequent selective breeding in Luning chickens.

AB Galangin (GAL), a flavonol found in Alpinia officinarum and propolis, is a promising functional food. This study investigated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of GAL in mice with hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) by focusing on renal metabolomics and network pharmacology. In this study, we conducted untargeted metabolomic analysis and network pharmacology prediction. Subsequently, a compound-reaction-enzyme-gene network was constructed based on the results of metabolomics and network pharmacology to elucidate potential connections. The results demonstrated that GAL can improve renal interstitial fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration and reduce serum levels of uric acid (UA), urea nitrogen (UREA), and creatinine (CREA). Metabolome analysis indicated that GAL affected thiamine, pyrimidine, nicotinate, nicotinamide, pyruvate, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Network pharmacology and experimental results showed that GAL reduced the key target expression of the tumor protein P53 (TP53), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90aa1), albumin (ALB), and caspase-3 (CASP3). GAL also downregulated the expression of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), phospho-JAK2 (P-JAK2), and phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3). Furthermore, a joint analysis of the metabolome and network pharmacology showed that GAL can reverse HN through amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, energy metabolism, and endocrine system pathways. GAL can alleviate HN effectively and might play synergistic therapeutic roles through regulating metabolic profiles and the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.

AB Organic selenium compounds are important molecules with a wide range of applications in pharmaceuticals, organic materials, catalysis, and other fields. Herein, we report the synthesis of alpha-selenomethylketones through the reaction of vinyl azides with arylselenols and benzylselenol. This protocol has the advantages of releasing only nitrogen as a benign byproduct, using air as an environmentally friendly initiator, a very short duration, mild reaction conditions, and broad substrate compatibility. The results of exploratory studies show that oxygen in the air is used as the initiator to promote this radical cascade reaction.

AB Quantitatively probing sub-nanometer elementary structural units of amorphous materials, such as amorphous silicon (a-Si), is essential for Si-based technological progress. However, accurately identifying and quantifying short-range order (SRO) and dangling bond/floating bond (DB/FB) defects over a large area in a-Si remains largely unexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that both the SRO and DB/FB defects at the sub-nanometer scale can be quantitatively characterized using Raman spectroscopy. Multi-wavelength lasers (450, 514, and 635 nm) are employed to modulate the sub-nanometer structures in a-Si films. Using in situ and ex situ Raman spectroscopy, structural evolution is tracked and changes in the Raman band at similar to 480 cm(-)(1) (omega 480) are investigated. These results reveal distinctly different effects of DB and FB defects on omega 480, which arise from defect-induced interfacial stress changes at the Continuous Random Network (CRN)-SRO interface. An analytical model is established to extract SRO dimensions and DB/FB defect densities from Raman spectra. These research findings deepen the understanding of sub-nanometer scale structures in amorphous materials and provide crucial methodological foundations for structural characterization and property modulation, showing promise for performance optimization and breakthroughs in amorphous material-based optoelectronic devices, especially those integrated with Si-based structures for cutting-edge applications.

AB Photosynthesis, growth, and plant maintenance respiration are closely related to tree tissue nitrogen (N) concentrations. While earlier studies of the variation in tissue N concentrations and underlying controls have mostly focused on leaves, here we identify the large-scale controls of N concentration in other tree compartments for the first time. This is achieved by constructing and analysing a novel database of N concentrations in stems, roots, and branches covering all common Northern Hemisphere boreal and temperate tree genera, combined with data for leaves mostly from existing databases. This database allows us to explore the large-scale abiotic (climate, soil N concentration) and biotic controls (tree age/size, leaf type, growth rate) of tree tissue N concentration. We find that N concentrations decrease with increasing tree age (or size) and are significantly higher in deciduous compared to evergreen trees in all tissues. Low growth rates or unfavourable climate conditions (very cold or dry climate) significantly decrease leaf (the latter only for needleleaf deciduous and needleleaf evergreen trees) but not stem N concentration, indicating their effects on N allocation. Plant traits and environmental conditions together explain very large parts of the variation in tissue N concentrations. These results suggest that changes in the distribution of tree age/size, species, and extreme climate, induced by climate change, forest management, or disturbances, will have substantial consequences for the carbon (C) sequestration potential of boreal and temperate forests by altering tissue N concentrations. We expect that the expansion of tree species better adapted to dry conditions in European temperate forests will result in a higher N concentration in all tree tissues and elevated N allocation fractions to stems, which might lead to higher productivity but also higher maintenance respiration. The identified relationships need to be represented in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) to estimate future effects of N limitation on the C cycle.

AB Objective: This study investigated how belief in a just world (BJW) influences prosocial behavior tendency (PBT) through psychological resilience (PR), and examined how empathic capacity (EC) moderates this mediation process. Method: Data were collected from 955 Chinese university students (Mage = 19.5 years, SD = 1.3; 65.6% female) using validated scales measuring BJW, PBT, PR, and EC. Results: Three key findings emerged: (1) BJW positively predicted PBT both directly (beta = 0.301, p < 0.001) and indirectly through PR; (2) EC moderated the relationship between BJW and PR, with the positive association being stronger for individuals with lower EC (b = 0.45, p < 0.001) compared to those with higher EC (b = 0.23, p < 0.01); (3) The indirect effect of BJW on PBT through PR was stronger for individuals with lower EC, indicating a moderated mediation effect. Conclusion: These findings advance our understanding of prosocial behavior by identifying distinct pathways through which beliefs and emotional capacities interact. The results suggest that interventions to promote prosocial behavior should be tailored based on individual differences in empathic capacity, with different approaches needed for high versus low EC individuals.

AB Background: Alcohol-induced liver injury (ALI) poses a significant threat to global human health. The Chinese Yi medicine Liangtoumao (LTM), which originated from the whole plant of Incarvillea arguta Royle (Royle), has been widely used by the Yi ethnic group to prevent and treat ALI and other liver diseases. However, its effectiveness and mechanisms are still under-researched. Purpose: The objective of our research is to investigate the chemical composition of LTM aqueous extract, evaluate its potential therapeutic intervention effect on ALI, and explore its mechanisms in rat models. Methods: The chemical components and constituents of LTM aqueous extract migrating to the blood were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to chronic binge alcohol exposure were utilized to establish chronic ALI models and evaluate the therapeutic effects of LTM aqueous extract. Serum and spatial metabolomics analyses were used to investigate potential mechanisms. Results: A total of 60 chemical components in LTM aqueous extract were identified, with 67 absorbed into the blood, including 29 original compounds and 38 metabolites. Treatment with LTM aqueous extract remarkably alleviated hepatic lesions in livers of ALI rats, improved liver function, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. Serum metabolomics and hepatic spatial metabolomics identified 30 and 215 differential metabolites, respectively. Metabolic pathways of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate, glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid, taurine and hypotaurine, and cysteine and methionine were closely related to the hepaprotective effects of LTM. Conclusion: Our research confirmed significant effects of LTM on ALI prevention and treatment for the first time. Metabolomic findings revealed that LTM significantly influences various aspects of lipid metabolism. This study supports expanded mechanism investigations of LTM and explores its possibility as a potential ALI therapy.

AB This study evaluated the activity and structural changes of mango polyphenol oxidase (PPO) after ultrasound (US) treatment at 21.3 W/cm(2) for 9 min, with varying concentrations of apple pectin (AP). The results showed that after US treatment, the PPO solution alone had a residual activity (RA) of 50.0%, and PPO exhibited changes in its secondary and tertiary structures. However, the addition of pectin increased RA of PPO and the RA reached 92.66% at 20 g/L AP after US, which was not significantly different from the untreated group (p > 0.05). Additionally, the introduction of pectin significantly reduced its structures changes. The exogenous fluorescence intensity of PPO solution added with 10 g/L AP treated with US did not differ significantly compared to the untreated sample. Thus, when the process of US inactivates PPO, pectin binds to PPO and exerts a protective effect, improving its stability.

AB This study developed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) biomimetic nanoparticle (Man-RBC-CVPP) containing Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide (CVP) and coated with a macrophage-targeting mannose receptor (DSPE-PEG-Man) modified RBCM. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Man-RBC-CVPP enhances antigen uptake and immune responses in RAW264.7 cells and can induce an immune response in mouse macrophages by activating the TLR4-mediated NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In vivo experiments showed that Man-RBCCVPP promotes the activation of splenic dendritic cells (DCs) by increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), CD80+, and CD86+. Further, it improves the maturation of splenic lymphocytes, increasing the expression of CD4+ and CD8+. It also upregulates the secretion of cytokines, raises serum levels of the specific antibody IgG, and slows the release of OVA at the injection site. In summary, ManRBC-CVPP can effectively enhance both cellular and humoral immune responses and provide controlled, longterm antigen release.

TI Understanding the biological identity of metal-organic framework through
   profiling proteomic fingerprinting of protein corona
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Protein corona; Proteomics; Nanomedicine; Biomaterials; Cellular uptake
AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered substantial interest in the biomedical field due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as high porosity and favorable biocompatibility. Upon exposure to biological environments, biomaterials interact with various proteins that adsorb spontaneously onto their surfaces, leading to the formation and evolution of a protein layer known as the protein corona (PC). However, the composition of the PC on MOFs and its influence on their biological identity remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examine protein corona formation on three types of MOF materials (ZIF-8, MIL-53(Fe), and UiO66) in serum, alongside their associated biological effects. Proteomics analysis revealed significant differences in protein corona composition across the three MOFs, particularly in the abundance and types of predominant proteins. Subsequent biological assessments indicated that PC formation mitigated the cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune response of macrophages toward MOFs. Regarding cellular uptake, protein corona formation markedly inhibited the uptake of ZIF-8 and MIL-53(Fe) by macrophages, while enhancing the internalization of UiO66 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, microtubule-dependent transport, and phagocytosis. Additionally, the PC of these MOFs were enriched with opsonins and dysopsonins that influence phagocytosis. This study is the first to reveal the proteomic composition of PC on these three representative MOFs and to elucidate the role of PC in modulating the biological identities of MOFs in macrophage interactions. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing MOFs-based drug delivery systems in clinical applications and provide new perspectives for exploring the complex physiological behaviors of protein coronas on biomaterials.

TI SRSF3 and hnRNP A1-mediated m6A-modified circCDK14 regulates
   intramuscular fat deposition by acting as miR-4492-z sponge

AB The intramuscular fat (IMF) content of yak beef is critical for determining its quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of endogenous non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important factors in the regulation of IMF deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms through which circRNAs regulate IMF deposition, particularly in yaks, remain unclear. In the present study, a novel circRNA, circCDK14 (originating from the yak's CDK14 gene), was identified by sequencing and RNase R treatment. In our previous study, we successfully established a ceRNA network map and identified miR-4492-z, which interacts with circCDK14. Furthermore, using methylation prediction software, we predicted two genes, SRSF3 and hnRNP A1, that have a strong binding relationship with circCDK14; existing research has confirmed their close association with m6A methylation modifications. On the basis of these findings, we comprehensively evaluated the effects of circCDK14, miR-4492-z, SRSF3 and hnRNP A1 on the proliferation and differentiation of yak intramuscular pre-adipocytes using EdU, CCK-8, BODIPY, Oil Red O and qRT-PCR analyses. Mechanistically, the interaction between circCDK14 and miR-4492-z was validated using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments. RIP assays revealed the binding interaction of circCDK14 with SRSF3 and hnRNP A1. The MeRIP experiments showed modification of circCDK14 methylation, with SRSF3 and hnRNP A1 promoting the methylation and translocation of circCDK14 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In summary, our results suggest that m6A-modified circCDK14 plays a crucial role as an miR-4492-z sponge in regulating IMF deposition in yaks and that the nuclear export of circCDK14 correlates with the expression levels of SRSF3 and hnRNP A1. This study provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of yak meat quality and promotes the development of molecular yak breeding.

AB Sanwu Huangqin Decoction (SHD), a classic prescription for nourishing yin and clearing heat, is commonly used to treat febrile diseases, erythromelalgia, autoimmune liver diseases, and skin diseases. However, research on the quality standard of SHD is still in its infancy and has focused mainly on single Chinese herbs, with few systematic studies. Currently, traditional Chinese medicine decoctions, as a complex polydisperse system, have attracted widespread attention. It is necessary to establish an integrated and rapid identification strategy for evaluating and controlling the quality of multiphase of SHD. The ingredients in the three phases of SHD were first isolated via the centrifugation-dialysis technique, and an method was established via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) for discrimination. The identification results and multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the SHD and three phases were clearly clustered, whereas the composition difference between the nanophase state and SHD was the smallest. Moreover, 34 significantly common differential markers were screened out by variable importance for projection (VIP) > 1 and P < 0.05 to construct the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) regression prediction model. Furthermore, a strategy for potential effective phase identification and quality evaluation index was established based on the absolute quantitative analysis of the 13 characteristic ingredients via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS). The comprehensive strategy of qualitative analysis combined with absolute quantitative analysis may be an effective tool for the identification and discrimination of SHD and the potential effective phase state. These findings could provide a significative reference for further revealing the material basis and determining the quality control indicators of SHD.

AB As China's rural revitalization progresses, the green and sustainable development of traditional dwellings has gained significant attention. Traditional Qiang dwellings in western Sichuan, located in high-altitude cold regions, often feature thick walls and small windows, limiting air circulation. Buffer spaces play a key role in improving indoor air quality and reducing energy consumption through natural ventilation. This study explores traditional Qiang dwellings in western Sichuan through field research, architectural analysis, and numerical simulations. The study analyzes three buffer space types and compares natural ventilation in dwellings with and without buffer spaces. The results show better air circulation in buildings with buffer spaces. The simulation further shows that when the courtyard's aspect ratio is 1.3 and the width-to-height ratio is 0.9, ventilation and air renewal rates are optimized. Based on this, the study proposes natural ventilation optimization strategies to reduce reliance on mechanical systems and improve energy efficiency. The study provides a scientific basis for low-carbon Qiang dwelling design and offers practical strategies for improving living environments, supporting sustainable rural development.

AB Alpine wetlands are crucial yet fragile ecosystems, with the Zoige alpine wetlands experiencing severe degradation. However, hydrological recovery alone has proven insufficient to restore essential wetland functions and may exacerbate degradation, particularly in nutrient cycling and microbial communities. This highlighting an urgent need for nature-based solutions. Periphyton, which could thrive in plateau and regulate nutrients, presents a promising approach. This study explored the potential of locally sourced periphyton to remediate degraded alpine wetlands, assessing its effects and mechanisms. The results demonstrated that periphyton could create an environment with stable pH and electrical conductivity. More importantly, it enhanced nutrient fixation and bioavailability by increasing the activities of beta-glucosidase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase, especially in the surface soil of alpine wetlands. It could be explained by microbiome analysis that periphyton boosted bacterial activity in the soil and improved the stability and complexity of soil bacterial communities. Specifically, periphyton promoted enzyme synthesis, metabolic function, and nutrient circulation at the functional gene level, and Pseudomonas, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria played critical roles in the remediation process. Most importantly, periphyton primarily regulated nutrients within the soil rather than directly introducing them to promote plant growth, with coverage exceeding 280 g/m2, yielding optimal physiological and reproductive states for alpine wetland plants. This study provided a potential nature-based solution for the remediation of degraded alpine wetlands.

AB Background Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a widely prevalent intracellular parasite that infects almost all warm-blooded animals and causes serious public health problems. The drugs currently used to treat toxoplasmosis have the disadvantage of being toxic and prone to the development of resistance, and the only licensed vaccine entails a risk of virulence restoration. The development of a safe and effective vaccine against T. gondii is urgently needed. Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) has been used as a potential vaccine expression vector for the treatment and prevention of various diseases. T. gondii GRA12 is a key virulence factor that resists host innate immunity and exhibits good antigenicity with several excellent B and T cell epitopes.Methods A recombinant spore named rBS-GRA12 was constructed by fusing the T. gondii GRA12 protein to the B. subtilis coat protein B (CotB). rBS-GRA12 spores were identified by PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence assays, amylase activity, and ultrastructural analysis. Immunological experiments were then conducted to assess the immunoprotective effects of rBS-GRA12. Groups of mice immunized with rBS-GRA12 (106, 108, or 1010 colony-forming units), GRA12 protein emulsified with Freund's adjuvant (FA+GRA12), Freund's adjuvant alone (FA), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or wild-type B. subtilis spores (WT). Splenocyte proliferation, antibodies, and cytokine expression levels were used to assess immune responses induced by the immunizations. All groups were inoculated with T. gondii RH strain, and survival times and parasite loads in tissues were used to assess protective effects against T. gondii infection.Results Amylase activity assays confirmed the generation of recombinant B. subtilis. PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence assays confirmed that the rBS-GRA12 spores expressed GRA12. Observation of rBS-GRA12 spores via transmission and scanning electron microscopy indicated that GRA12 expression had no effect on spore morphology or structure. Splenocyte proliferation was significantly greater in all three rBS-GRA12 groups than in the FA+GRA12 group, and IgG and IgG2a subclass titers were higher. Substantial production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-12, and an increase in IL-4 production were evident in the rBS-GRA12-108 group. Secretory sIgA levels were significantly elevated in all three rBS-GRA12 groups than in the FA+GRA12 group and the control groups. Brain and liver tissues parasite loads were significantly lower in the three rBS-GRA12 groups than in any other group. Compared to all other groups, mice in the three rBS-GRA12 groups exhibited longer survival times when challenged with acute T. gondii infection.Conclusion Mice immunized with rBS-GRA12 exhibited higher levels of cellular, humoral, and mucosal immune responses than control mice. These results provide a new perspective for the development of T. gondii vaccines.

AB Introduction Semen cryopreservation is a crucial method for preserving genetic resources and accelerating the breeding process in domestic animals. However, the frozen-thawed process often leads to physical and chemical damage in semen, resulting in oxidative stress that diminishes sperm vitality and fertilization potential. This study aimed to explore the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the quality of frozen-thawed yak semen. Methods Semen samples were collected from six healthy adult Maiwa yaks and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using extenders with varying DHA concentrations: 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL. After thawing, we assessed indices, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial activity, and apoptosis status to identify the optimal DHA concentration. Results and discussion Our findings indicate that the addition of DHA significantly improved the total motility (TM), progressive motility (PM), velocity of straight line (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), and average path velocity (VAP) of cryopreserved spermatozoa, as well as the integrity of membrane and acrosome (P < 0.05). Additionally, DHA supplementation markedly reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in frozen-thawed yak spermatozoa (P < 0.05) and enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities (T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, P < 0.05). It also improved the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP levels (P < 0.05). Notably, the group treated with 10 ng/mL DHA showed significantly better outcomes than the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the addition of 10 ng/mL DHA to the semen cryopreservation dilution effectively decreased the apoptotic ratio of frozen-thawed yak spermatozoa (P < 0.05), and notably upregulated the expression level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (P < 0.05), while downregulating the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and Caspase3 (P < 0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, the incorporation of 10 ng/mL DHA into semen extenders enhances the quality and viability of yak sperm after cryopreservation by alleviating the oxidative stress, bolstering antioxidant defenses, and preserving mitochondria function, as well as inhibiting the apoptotic pathway activation.

AB As a key tool for addressing environmental pollution and fostering a green economy, voluntary environmental regulation has a profound impact on the distribution of factor income. To increase labor income share and alleviate conflicts between labor and capital, this study offers new theoretical insights and solutions from the perspective of voluntary environmental programs. Specifically, it treats ISO14001 environmental standard certification as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the causal relationship between voluntary environmental programs and corporate labor income share and derives the following conclusions. The baseline regression results indicate that voluntary environmental programs significantly increase the labor income share of corporations. Mechanism analysis reveals that reducing financial constraints, optimizing human capital structure, and weakening market monopoly power are crucial pathways through which voluntary environmental programs enhance labor income share. Heterogeneity tests show that the positive impact of voluntary environmental programs on labor income share is more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises, highly polluting enterprises, enterprises in regions with stronger environmental governance, and those in more market-oriented industries. Further research indicates that voluntary environmental programs significantly improve the compensation of regular employees and narrow internal income disparities within corporations, thus accelerating the achievement of the strategic goal of common prosperity.

AB Encroachment of alpine grassland ecosystems by shrubs is widespread in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, effects of shrub encroachment on fungal community structure and its function are limited. The objective of this study was to elucidate the response of soil organic carbon composition, soil fungal community, and their functions to shrub encroachment within the same region. We investigated soil fungal communities in top- and subsoils of shrub-encroached patches (Potentilla fruticosa, Spiraea alpina and Caragana microphylla) and the open grassland using nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). A total of 48 samples were collected. The Fourier Translation Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted to assess the soil organic carbon (SOC) chemical composition. Potential fungal functions were explored using FUNGuild. Both top- and subsoils, total nitrogen (TN) and SOC contents did not alter under shrub patches compared to the open grassland (control sites) (TN, F=1.460, p = 0.24; SOC, F=1.294, p = 0.267). The aromatic groups were dominant fraction in SOC at top- and subsoils under shrub-encroached and unencroached sites. Shrub encroachment exhibited a higher fungal diversity in topsoil, and a significantly different fungal community composition in top- and subsoils compared with open grassland. Results of FUNGuild showed saprotroph was the dominant fungal trophic mode among the P. fruticosa, S. alpina and C. microphylla patches, and saprotroph in P. fruticosa and S. alpina were significantly higher than open grassland in the topsoil (F=6.621, p = 0.028; F=8.224, p = 0.017), not in the subsoil (F=0.467, p = 0.510; F =2.888, p = 0.120). Co-occurrence networks between fungal taxa showed higher network links and more assembled, indicating the stability of fungal community was promoted by shrub development. Hierarchical partitioning (HP) analysis indicated that pH and SOC were the main key factors affecting fungal community structure in top- and subsoils, respectively. Shrub encroachment in alpine grassland leads to soil fungi preferring to utilize the relatively accessible recalcitrant SOC (aliphatic group), and causes enrichment of copiotrophic fungi.

A total of 720 1-day-old male yellow-feathered broilers were randomly divided into 9 treatments, with 8 cages per treatment and 10 birds per cage. The Fe supplementation was 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 160, 320, 640, and 1280 mg/kg, respectively, in the form of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O. The results showed that the ADG (P = 0.002) and ADFI (P < 0.001) decreased linearly with increased dietary Fe supplementation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in plasma (P = 0.001), duodenum (P < 0.001), and jejunum (P <0.001) were increased linearly as dietary Fe increased. As dietary Fe increased, there was a linear decrease in the villus height and the villus height/crypt depth in the duodenum (P = 0.003; P = 0.001) and jejunum (P = 0.001; P < 0.001). Decreased secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) concentration in jejunal mucosa (P < 0.001) was observed with increased dietary Fe concentration. Lower jejunal sIgA concentrations were observed in birds consuming more than 160 mg/kg of Fe (P < 0.001). A quadratic response was found for jejunal diamine oxidase (DAO) activity (P = 0.011) as dietary Fe supplementation was increased. The highest response of DAO in jejunal mucosa was observed for broilers supplemented with 160 mg/kg of Fe. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of ZO-1 (P < 0.001), occludin (P = 0.004), and claudin-1 (P = 0.007) in jejunal mucosa decreased linearly with increased dietary Fe concentration. Data from the study suggests that there is no need to supplement additional Fe to a corn-soybean-based diet for yellowfeathered broilers based on growth performance, antioxidant potential, small intestinal histology, and intestinal barrier. Chronic iron exposure (>= 160 mg/kg) can damage the intestinal barrier function, and further increase of Fe supplementation can lead to oxidative stress and even cause growth inhibition for yellow-feathered broilers.

AB Zinc-iodine batteries, which have the advantages of low cost, high safety, long lifespan, and high energy density, currently rank as one of the most promising electrical energy storage devices. However, these batteries still face significant challenges, including sluggish iodine redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of polyiodides. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in cathode catalysts for zinc-iodine batteries, with a particular focus on the electrochemical processes and working mechanisms of catalysts, and delves into the prospects and scientific issues associated with their development. It then presents a detailed analysis of the mechanisms, principles, and performances of various catalysts, including heteroatom-doped carbon materials, single-atom catalysts, dual-atom catalysts, molecular catalysts, and transition metal compounds, in catalyzing the cathodes of zinc-iodine batteries. These diverse catalysts, with their unique functionalities and catalytic effects, can substantially address the kinetic challenges related to iodine conversion efficiency and the stability issues associated with polyiodide shuttle. Nonetheless, several challenges persist, such as reducing the synthesis cost of catalysts, minimizing catalyst usage to enhance the overall energy density of zinc-iodine batteries, and improving the long-term activity of catalysts. This review is expected to deepen our understanding of cathode catalysts for zinc-iodine batteries and facilitate their practical applications in the future.

AB In recent years, optimization algorithms have developed rapidly, especially those which introduce quantum ideas, which perform excellently. Inspired by quantum thought, this paper proposes a quantum dynamics framework (QDF) which converts optimization problems into the problem of the constrained ground state of the quantum system and analyzes optimization algorithms by simulating the dynamic evolution process of physical optimization systems in the ground state. Potential energy equivalence and Taylor expansion are performed on the objective function to obtain the basic iterative operations of optimization algorithms. Furthermore, a quantum dynamics framework based on the quantum tunneling effect (QDF-TE) is proposed which adopts dynamic multiple group collaborative sampling to improve the quantum tunneling effect of the QDF, thereby increasing the population diversity and improving algorithm performance. The probability distribution of solutions can be visually observed through the evolution of the wave function, which also indicates that the QDF-TE can strengthen the tunneling effect. The QDF-TE was evaluated on the CEC 2017 test suite and shown to be competitive with other heuristic optimization algorithms. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of introducing a quantum mechanism to analyze and improve optimization algorithms.

AB Business education researchers have counseled that to stimulate student engagement in online spaces, using interactive educational resources was suggested, given its efficacy. Nonetheless, the research identified numerous challenges regarding its use. Also, research acknowledges the slow adoption of these resources, given the challenges of digital literacy and other difficulties. Prior studies maintained that the major limitation of their studies was the negligence of using interactive resources in a blended form. On this premise, this study investigates the efficacy of blended interactive educational resources in improving business education student learning outcomes. The study used a convergent mixed-method research design with an experimental approach to investigate the efficacy of blended interactive educational resources. The study collected data from 90 participants through posttest and interviews on this objective. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Given the abnormal distribution, the Wisconsin sign ranked test, a non-parametric test, was administered. After collecting and analyzing the data, the study found that although business education students using blended interactive educational resources performed better, others performed below the average.

AB Monomer compounds from natural products are the major source of active pharmaceutical molecules, which provide great opportunities for discovering of new drugs. However, natural products contain a large number of rather complex compounds. It is difficult to obtain high-purity monomer compounds from complex natural products. Herein, we developed molecularly imprinted macroporous adsorption resins (MIRs-PDA) for the selective adsorption of target monomer compounds from natural products. The response surface methodology was employed to optimize the fabrication parameters. The separation performance of MIRs-PDA for the representative monomer compound rutin was thoroughly studied. We found that MIRs-PDA presented large adsorption capacity (107.82 mg/g), high selectivity (selectivity coefficient was 2.90), good repeatability, and reusability. MIRs-PDA can reach 78.5% equilibrium adsorption capacity in 20 min, showing quick binding kinetic behavior. Furthermore, MIRs-PDA showed good selective and specific adsorption performance for rutin from a representative real sample of Fagopyrum tataricum extract solution. The study of the adsorption mechanism showed that the adsorption of rutin on MIRs-PDA was spontaneous and thermodynamically feasible. The kinetic parameters adapted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and there existed equivalent binding sites in MIRs-PDA. The MIRs-PDA show promising application prospects for the separation of monomer compounds in natural products.

AB Seawater electrolysis has garnered considerable interest as an environmentally sustainable method for hydrogen production. However, the abundance of chloride ions in seawater poses a challenge to electrocatalyst stability, underscoring the need for catalysts with exceptional durability and efficiency to facilitate effective seawater oxidation. In this study, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was intercalated into a NiFe layered double hydroxide on nickel foam (NF/NiFe LDH), creating an advanced seawater oxidation electrocatalyst (NF/NiFe LDH@TPP) that effectively resists chloride-induced corrosion. Remarkably, the TPP-intercalated catalyst demonstrates superior kinetics and selectivity for the oxygen evolution reaction, reaching a current density of 1 A cm-2 with an overpotential as low as 385 mV, while sustaining stable seawater oxidation performance for over 500 h.

AB BackgroundThe St-genome-sharing taxa are highly complex group of the species with the St nuclear genome and monophyletic origin in maternal lineages within the Triticeae, which contains more than half of polyploid species that distributed in a wide range of ecological habitats. While high level of genetic heterogeneity in plastome DNA due to a reticulate evolutionary event has been considered to link with the richness of the St-genome-sharing taxa, the relationship between the dynamics of diversification and molecular evolution is lack of understanding.ResultsHere, integrating 106 previously and 12 newly sequenced plastomes representing almost all previously recognized genomic types and genus of the Triticeae, this study applies phylogenetic reconstruction methods in combination with lineage diversification analyses, estimate of sequence evolution, and gene expression to investigate the dynamics of diversification in the tribe. Phylogenomic analysis confirmed previous phylogenetic relationships, with the St/E/V lineages (Pseudoroegneria/Lophopyrum + Thinopyrum/Dasypyrum) being suffered from a chloroplast capture event prior to polyploidization events. Analyses of diversification rates detected a significant acceleration approximately five million years ago in the St-genome-sharing taxa. Molecular tests of evolution and gene expression further indicated that radiation within the accelerated group has been accompanied by adaptive genetic changes in a few chloroplast-encoded genes directly or indirectly related to photosynthesis.ConclusionsOur results support an important role for adaptive evolution in plastomes during accelerated diversification. In combination with plastome data, further investigations using other genomes, such as the nuclear genome, are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of the evolutionary history of the St-genome-sharing taxa, especially to determine whether adaptive changes in the nuclear genome are accelerated as well because plastome represents the maternal inheritation in angiosperms.

AB This paper investigates the frequency regulation problems with high level renewable energy sources (RESs) penetration under unreliable network. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) incorporated with load frequency control (LFC) method (VSG-LFC) is proposed by introducing an adaptive event-triggered mechanism with the awareness of the bandwidth occupation rate (AETM-ABOR) to reduce the system sensitivity to the penetration level of RESs and achieve a balance between control performance and network resource usage under limited communication environments. Then, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with the two-sided looped functional terms is proposed to derive criteria that satisfies the H-infinity performance index and controller design. Finally, simulation evaluations on numerical models and a two-area four-machine power system are conducted to verify the availability and effectiveness of this development. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of frequency regulation. As the penetration of RESs into the power system is gradually increasing, the lack of inertial characteristics of power electronics that connect RESs to the power system poses a threat to the frequency stability of the power system. A VSG-LFC strategy is applied to effectively compensate the equivalent system inertia. Meanwhile, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism with the awareness of the bandwidth occupation rate is designed to compromise the data transmission and system control performance. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted to illustrate that this design is capable of providing expected performance.

AB In this article, we amalgamate the low-level vision task of visible-infrared image fusion (VIIF) with the high-level vision task of target detection (TD), culminating in a holistic framework tailored for the surveillance of complex Airport scenes. Our proposed model capitalizes on the integration of detailed information from multiple sources, augmenting TD efficacy in the framework's backend, while steering the fusion process in the frontend through the utilization of semantic insights gleaned from the TD task. Central to our approach is a feature extraction module that exploits dilated convolution and dense connections to bolster feature representation. Furthermore, inspired by the top-down attention mechanisms evident in biological vision systems, we devise a multiscale fusion technique rooted in attention mechanisms. Additionally, drawing from the concept of the "sleep-wake" mechanism observed in animal brains, we enable end-to-end training of multitasks despite inherent target discrepancies. Specifically, we strategically employ the TD loss to guide the VIIF process, thereby enhancing fusion outcomes while concurrently elevating TD performance. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis of human psychophysical data, object detection performance, image quality metrics, and training and testing efficiency analysis conducted on both the publicly available M3FD and FLIR datasets, alongside a complex Airport scene dataset under five imaging conditions curated by our research group, our proposed method showcases superior performance in both VIIF and TD tasks compared to prevailing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The Airport dataset and code will be made available at https://github.com/rwerwer2024/Sleep-Wake-Joint-Fusion-main.

AB Purpose Bacterial infection, oxidative stress, vascular damage, and nutrient deficiencies significantly hinder the repair of diabetic skin wounds. Conventional wound dressings offer limited protection and fail to effectively promote the healing of diabetic wounds. To address these challenges, we developed a photothermal-responsive Bletilla striata polysaccharide hydrogel capable of releasing carbon dioxide (CO2@PDA Hydrogel). Methods This hydrogel utilizes carboxymethylated Bletilla striata polysaccharide as the primary matrix, cross-linked through metal coordination bonds, and incorporates bicarbonate-containing polydopamine nanoparticles (CO2@PDA NPs) with photothermal conversion properties to generate CO2. The structure and morphology of CO2@PDA NPs were characterized by DLS, SEM, FTIR, and XRD, and the hydrogel properties of CO2@PDA Hydrogel were characterized by SEM, rheological properties, and FTIR. The photothermal properties of the CO2@PDA Hydrogel were studied by measuring the temperature change and CO2 release after irradiation with an NIR laser (808nm). The improvement effect of CO2@PDA Hydrogel on the diabetes wound microenvironment was comprehensively evaluated by promoting L929 cell proliferation, inhibiting bacterial growth (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli), and treating diabetes wound infection in rat models. Results Under 808 nm near-infrared laser irradiation, the embedded CO2@PDA NPs convert light into heat, triggering the decomposition of HCO3- and releasing a substantial amount of CO2 locally at the diabetic wound site. The released CO2 responds to the Bohr effect, alleviating hypoxia and promoting angiogenesis. Simultaneously, the Bletilla striata polysaccharide in the hydrogel exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, while the cross-linking agent Fe3+ and the photothermal properties of CO2@PDA NPs provide robust antibacterial activity. Conclusion The self-assembled cross-linked carboxymethyl Bletilla striata polysaccharide Hydrogel with CO2@PDA NPs prepared in this study has a good photothermal conversion effect. It improves the microenvironment of diabetes wounds by improving hypoxia, antibacterial, antioxidant, and other effects, providing a good multi-functional alternative material for the treatment of refractory diabetes wounds.

AB The paradox between massive rural revitalisation and cultural preservation calls for new sustainable development strategies. How to strike a balance between them has become a research hotspot especially for traditional villages in developing countries. Through data collection, field research and analogy, this article explores the spatial prototypes of mandala, Mount Meru and 'zhai xin' (central stronghold) concept, and points out the coupling relationship between spatial patterns and Tibetan settlements and its influences on settlement layout, architectural forms, and local customs, which includes the cultural philosophy of spatial patterns, the structure of human settlements, village layout, road network planning, and core node building complex. Taking Ge'en Tibetan Village revamping program in Aba Tibetan and Qiang County as an illustrative example, this design strategy will not only improve local residents' living standards, but also helps to retain the cultural essence of traditional villages, thereby diving the development of tourism and other tertiary industries. Based on cultural heritage preservation, this work offers new perspectives on land use planning and architectural design for the revitalisation and sustainable development of traditional village in under-developed areas.

AB BackgroundHigh-quality bowel preparation is paramount for a successful colonoscopy. This study aimed to explore the effect of artificial intelligence-driven smartphone software on the quality of bowel preparation.MethodsFirstly, we utilized 3305 valid liquid dung images collected via mobile phones as training data. the most effective model was employed on mobile phones to evaluate the quality of bowel preparation. Secondly, From May 2023 to September 2023, colonoscopy patients were randomly assigned to two groups - the AI group (n = 116) and the control group (n = 116) - using a randomized, controlled, endoscopist-blinded method. We compared the two groups in terms of Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) scores, polyp detection rate, adverse reaction rate, and factors related to bowel preparation quality. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a BBPS >= 6 among those who effectively utilized the smartphone software.ResultsEfficientNetV2 exhibited the highest performance, with an accuracy of 87%, a sensitivity of 83%, and an AUC of 0.86. In the patient validation experiment, the AI group had higher BBPS scores than the control group (6.78 +/- 1.41 vs. 5.35 +/- 2.01, p = 0.001) and showed an improvement in the detection rate (71.55% vs. 56.90%, p = 0.020) for polyps. Multifactor logistic analysis indicated that compliance with enema solution usage rules (OR: 5.850, 95% confidence interval: 2.022-16.923), total water intake (OR: 1.001, 95% confidence interval: 1.001-1.002), and AI software reminders (OR: 2.316, 95% confidence interval: 1.096-4.893) were independently associated with BBPS scores >= 6.ConclusionCompared with traditional methods, the use of artificial intelligence combined with software to send reminders can lead to more accurate assessments of bowel preparation quality and an improved detection rate for polyps, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

AB Gentiana lawrencei var. farreri (GLF) is one of the varieties of the Tibetan medicinal herb "Bang Jian", known as "Longdanhua" have been employed in Tibetan medicine for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of its play on the pharmacodynamic material and anti-inflammatory mechanism are still unclear. Therefore, in this study, we proposed UPLC-Q-TOF/MS combined with network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vitro experimental validation to explore the material basis and potential mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of GLF. Firstly, 43 compounds of GLF were identified by UPLCQ-TOF/MS. Next, the potential 6 core active components, 15 core targets and 5 key pathways of GLF for the treatment of inflammation were used to predicted by network pharmacology. Then, molecular docking was used to validate the binding ability of core chemical constituents and core targets of GLF, and the results showed that the 6 core chemical constituents could bind well to 15 core targets, among which isoorientin had the lowest binding energy to AKT1 (-10.5 kcal mol- 1). Finally, the promising anti-inflammatory activity of the key component isoorientin was verified by the LPS-induced macrophage inflammation model in RAW264.7 mice. This study revealed the anti-inflammatory pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of GLF, which provide a theoretical basis for the development, utilization, and clinical application of GLF.

The system consists of a passive modified split-ring resonator (MSRR) and RF active circuits. The MSRR is improved from the conventional split-ring resonator (SRR), and the electric field is enhanced through the mutual coupling of multiple split rings to improve sensitivity. The RF active circuit is mainly composed of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a power amplifier (PA), and a microwave rectifier circuit (RC). The VCO is used to provide a stable and tunable microwave signal, and the PA serves as a compensatory element to offset power attenuation within the system. The detecting system demonstrates the capability to convert the varying concentration of liquids under test (LUTs) into a readable dc voltage value. Based on the correlation between alcohol solution concentrations and voltage values, a mathematical model has been developed to predict the concentration of unknown samples. According to the results, the maximum error in extracting concentration is 3.67% and the maximum sensitivity is 3.82 mV/%. The proposed system eliminates the need for expensive experimental equipment, such as a vector network analyzer (VNA), RF signal generator, and spectrum analyzer, thus reducing costs. Additionally, the proposed design has the feasibility detecting scenarios in solid and gas samples characterization with high precision, low cost, and portable features.

AB As crucial materials for electromagnetic transmission, even minor defects in microwave dielectric substrates can impact or deteriorate the performance of designed microwave circuits. To address it, an active microwave defect detection system has been proposed. The system employs a 3 dB directional coupler paired with two identical half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) resonators, forming a symmetric-structured sensor to enhance sensitivity and distinguish minute substrate defects. One port of the sensor is loaded with defective materials under test (MUT), while the other port remains unloaded as a reference. The proposed sensor can transform sample defect information into variations in the magnitude and phase of the transmission coefficient. The sensor is integrated into an active gain/phase detector (GPD) to output two dc voltages, both of which can be used to predict the substrate defect conditions. System simulations and measurements are performed by detecting several commercial substrates, including FR4, RO5880, RO4350, and others. Experimental results show that the maximum sensitivity is 258.8 mV/ Delta epsilon(r) ' (Where Delta epsilon(r )' represents the varying relative permittivity). With the advantages of high sensitivity, low cost, and robustness against external environments, this work paves the way for portable defect detection and monitoring of nonmetal materials.

AB The impact of calcium ion (Ca2+) on the uptake, distribution, and gene expression related to the metabolism of selenium (Se) in barley was methodically studied. The introduction of 0.5 mM Ca2+ markedly enhanced Se uptake and assimilation during the soaking phase of barley, leading to increased Se concentrations in the acrospire, rootlets, and primarily in the cell walls and cytoplasm. Calcium also elevated the expression of genes associated with Se transport and metabolism, thereby improving Se conversion in tissues and its enrichment in globulin and gliadin. In contrast, Ca2+ concentrations exceeding 4.0 mM significantly inhibited barley's growth and respiration, intensifying Se toxicity. Furthermore, Ca2+ mitigated Se-induced oxidative stress by modulating stress-responsive molecules such as NO, H2O2, and proline. It also modified intracellular Se transport and metabolic pathways, thus regulating its distribution and bioavailability in barley. The study revealed the critical role of Ca2+ in the Se uptake and transformation in barley, providing a scientific foundation for developing new crop biofortification strategies.

AB Background: Salmonella Enteritidis is one of the main pathogens of foodborne diseases and an important pathogen causing diarrhea in yaks. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for salmonellosis, but the widespread use of antibiotics has increased Salmonella resistance. Probiotics have been shown to antagonize Salmonella and reduce Salmonella infection. Bacillus pumilus is one of the microbial feed additives approved by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture for use in animal breeding, which has the effect of improving animal growth performance and immunity, among others. Therefore, this paper explored the anti-infective effect of Bacillus pumilus against Salmonella. Results: Bacillus pumilus SMU5927 significantly enhances the intestinal mechanical barrier and reduces the number of Salmonella transferred to the organs. Bacillus pumilus SMU5927 ameliorated intestinal tissue damage and attenuated intestinal inflammatory responses in mice. In addition, Bacillus pumilus increased the ratio of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in the intestinal flora, increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, and decreased the abundance of harmful bacteria. Conclusion: This study confirmed the role of Bacillus pumilus SMU5927 in preventing and attenuating Salmonella damage and provided ideas for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs.

AB BackgroundEnergy deficiency is a leading cause of the high pre-weaning mortality of neonatal piglets in the swine industry. Thus, optimal energy metabolism is of crucial importance for improving the survivability of neonatal piglets. The effective utilization of milk fat as primary energy is indispensably required.MethodsPregnant sows (n = 27) were randomly assigned into 3 treatments. Each treatment received a standard diet (3,265 kcal ME/kg) supplemented with either 0, 0.25% or 0.5% clofibrate (w/w) from d 107 of gestation to d 7 of lactation. The effects of maternal clofibrate on their milk fatty acid (FA) and performance of the piglets were evaluated. The evaluations were performed via measuring sow productive performance, milk FA composition, and hepatic FA oxidation of the piglets at birth and d 1, 7, 14 and 19 after birth.ResultsMaternal supplementation of clofibrate had no effect on reproductive performance of the sows at farrowing and weaning (P > 0.05). However, the mortality at weaning was reduced for piglets from sows with 0.25% of clofibrate, and the average weekly (and daily) gain was higher in piglets from sows that received clofibrate than sows without clofibrate in the first week (P < 0.0001). Maternal clofibrate increased percentage of milk C12:0 and C14:0 FAs but decreased C18:2 and n-6 polyunsaturated FAs. Maternal clofibrate also increased plasma ketone body levels and hepatic FA oxidation measured at the first day of birth, but the increase was not detected in piglets on d 7, 14 or 19. Clofibrate was not detected in milk collected from the clofibrate-treated sows. The percentage of FA oxidation decreased, and the percentage of FA esterification increased with increasing in postnatal age. Supplemental carnitine increased FA oxidation regardless of succinate dehydrogenase inhibition, and the increase had no effect on FA esterification.ConclusionsMaternal supplementation of clofibrate during late gestation and early lactation increases hepatic FA oxidative metabolism at birth and improves growth performance of newborn piglets. Maternal clofibrate transfer to suckling piglets via milk was not detected. Carnitine availability is critical for piglets to maintain a high FA oxidation rate during the suckling period.

AB Planting oat forage in fallow fields during winter and producing total mixed ration (TMR) silage can effectively address issues of land wastage and forage shortages while maintaining forage quality. This study used oats and common vetch grown in winter fields in southern China as base materials, with additives including corn flour, soybean meal, corn lees, cottonseed meal, and premixes to formulate mixed feeds with roughage-to-concentrate ratios of 75:25, 70:30, and 65:35 on a dry matter basis. TMR silage was inoculated with a customized mixed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) additive composed of Lactobacillus plantarum 160 (patent number ZL202210218695.5), Lactobacillus pentosus 260 (patent number ZL202210204293), and Lactobacillus buchneri 225 (patent number ZL202210204293), at a ratio of 2:1:1, with addition rates of 4 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6), and 2 x 10(6)cfu/g, respectively (IN), while sterile distilled water served as the control (CK). After a 60-day fermentation, the cornell net carbohydrate protein system (CNCPS) and in vitro digestion analysis were used to assess the effects of different roughage-to-concentrate ratios on the carbohydrate and protein components and ruminal degradation rate of fermented TMR (FTMR) silage, as well as to evaluate the impact of mixed LAB inoculation on FTMR nutritional quality, fermentation quality, and aerobic stability. The results indicated the following: (1) Regardless of the LAB addition, dry matter (DM), ether extract (EE), crude protein (CP), and Ash contents significantly decreased (p < 0.05) as the concentrate level decreased. In the IN group, as the concentrate level decreased, the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content significantly increased (p < 0.05), the pH significantly decreased (p < 0.05), and the NH3-N/TN significantly decreased (p < 0.05), with LAB counts significantly higher at a 65:35 roughage-to-concentrate ratio than in the other two groups. In the CK group, no significant changes (p > 0.05) were observed in the WSC content, pH, or LAB counts. (2) CNCPS analysis showed that in the IN group, the carbohydrate (CHO) content at a 75:25 roughage-to-concentrate ratio was significantly higher than in the other two groups (p < 0.05), while the non-utilizable carbohydrate (CC) content was significantly lower (p < 0.05). As the concentrate levels decreased, the non-protein nitrogen (PA) and moderately degradable true protein (PB2) content significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas the rapidly degradable true protein (PB1) and slowly degradable true protein (PB3) content significantly decreased (p < 0.05). In the CK group, the CHO, PA, PB2, and PC content significantly increased (p < 0.05) as concentrate levels decreased, while the PB1 and PB3 content significantly decreased (p < 0.05). (3) In vitro digestibility characteristics indicated that gas production (GP) in the IN group was significantly lower than in the CK group (p < 0.05), with crude protein degradability increasing as concentrate levels decreased, regardless of the LAB addition. (4) At a 65:35 roughage-to-concentrate ratio, aerobic stability in the IN group was significantly higher than in the CK group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, higher concentrate ratios in total mixed rations (TMRs) with varying roughage-to-concentrate proportions improve the nutritional quality and promote the ruminal degradation of the FTMR. LAB inoculant addition could be an effective approach for addressing FTMR feed challenges.

AB With the acceleration of urbanization, many traditional buildings have been dismantled and built indiscriminately, resulting in a uniform urban landscape. The problem of urban microclimate has been aggravated, and the renovation of historic districts, especially including the renewal of microclimate, has become an important component of sustainable urban renewal. The old commercial street in Huili Ancient City is used as an example in this paper. Through literature research, we note that previous studies have mainly examined the renewal of historic districts from the perspective of the old city environment, while most of the traditional neighborhood renewal designs have neglected the wind and heat environments. Combining the limitations of previous studies and field research, we summarized the current problems of the neighborhood and developed specific renovation strategies for the identified problems in terms of historical and cultural heritage, the relationship between the old and the new, and the layout of green building technologies. In addition, the green building strategy was used to optimize the microclimate environment of the neighborhood, and the wind and heat environment simulation was conducted to evaluate the modeling of the renovated neighborhood. The results show that the outdoor wind environment is better in winter than in summer, and the natural ventilation environment of the neighborhood could be optimized by optimizing the building layout to form an alleyway wind. The indoor wind-heat environment simulation was carried out with the Green Pottery Experience Hall as an example, and the indoor and outdoor air circulation and ventilation were good, and the comfort of the human thermal environment was high. This paper explores the updating strategy of the historic district in the transition zone between old and new and the wind-heat environment simulation and evaluation of green building renovation, which provides a new perspective for the related renovation research and the optimization strategy of the microclimate environment in the district.

AB Biological nitrogen (N) fixation by soil diazotrophs is the primary source of nitrogen for natural grasslands, especially at high altitudes such as alpine meadow ecosystems. However, the mechanisms shaping the compositions and assembly processes of diazotrophic communities, as well as soil nitrogenase activity in alpine meadows remain poorly understood. In this study, 241 soil samples were collected from alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to investigate the distribution patterns and driving factors of diazotrophic communities and nitrogenase activities. Our results showed that soil N fixation potential across all samples ranged from 28.8 to 110 nmol C2H4 g-1h-1, and Nitrospirillum and Bradyrhizobium were the most dominant diazotrophic genera. The composition and diversity of soil diazotrophic communities were mainly influenced by soil pH, and to a lesser extent by aridity index and mean annual precipitation. The abundance of nifH gene decreased linearly with soil pH, whereas the alpha-diversity increased linearly with soil total phosphorus. Null model analysis indicated that deterministic processes governed diazotrophic community assembly, and more acidic soil conditions led to more phylogenetically clustered diazotrophic communities. Partial least squares path modeling and linear regression analyses identified diazotrophic community composition, followed by climatic factors, nifH gene abundance and total phosphorus, as the dominant regulators of soil N fixation potential in alpine meadows. Unexpectedly, soil N fixation potential was not closely related to dominant diazotrophic genera, diversity, or assembly, but highly related to the less abundant diazotrophs. This study provides a novel insight into the ecological mechanisms shaping soil biological nitrogen fixation in alpine meadow ecosystems.

ID CONFIGURATION
AB With the increasing size of training datasets and models, parameter synchronization stage puts a heavy burden on the network, and communication has become one of the main performance bottlenecks of distributed machine learning (DML). Concurrently, optical circuit switch (OCS) with high bandwidth and reconfigurable features has increasingly introduced into the construction of network topology, obtaining the reconfigurable optical networks. Actually, OCS is conducive to accelerating the parameter synchronization stage, and thus improves training performance. However, unreasonable circuit scheduling algorithm has a great impact on parameter synchronization time because of non-negligible OCS switching delay. Besides, most of the existing circuit scheduling algorithms do not effectively use the training characteristics of DML, and the performance gains are limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study the parameter synchronization scheduling algorithm in reconfigurable optical networks, and propose PSscheduler by jointly optimizing the circuit scheduling and deployment of parameter servers in parameter server (PS) architecture. Specifically, a mathematical optimization model is established first, which takes into account the deployment of parameter servers, the allocation of parameter blocks and circuit scheduling. Subsequently, the mathematical model is solved by relaxed variables and deterministic rounding approach. The results of simulation based on real DML workloads demonstrate that compared to Sunflow and HLF , PSscheduler is more stable and can reduce parameter synchronization time (PST) by up to 46.61% and 25%, respectively.

AB During widespread applications of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the environmental hazards and risks of MOFs have aroused great concerns. In this study, we aimed to reveal the importance of the environmental stability of MOFs on their toxicity. Two Zn-MOFs, namely, ZIF-8 with high aqueous stability and Zn-BDC with low aqueous stability, were compared directly in the toxicological evaluations of a nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. Zn-BDC showed strong cytotoxicity at 100 mg/L and higher, inducing growth inhibition, cell apoptosis, structural changes, oxidative damage, and, consequently, loss of nitrogen fixation ability. In contrast, ZIF-8 was nearly nontoxic to A. vinelandii. The transcriptome analysis showed that Zn-BDC directly disturbed the ribosome pathway and lowered the expression level of nitrogen-fixing nif cluster genes. On the other hand, ZIF-8 stress could regulate the flagellar assembly, siderophore group nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, bacterial chemotaxis, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways to promote the cell growth of A. vinelandii. Beyond that, the toxicity of Zn-MOFs to A. vinelandii was associated with the release of Zn2+, but Zn-MOFs were less toxic than the mixtures of their starting materials. Overall, our results suggested that the environmental stability of Zn-MOFs determined their environmental toxicity through different molecular pathways. Designing stable MOFs is preferred due to environment-friendly considerations.

AB The low temperature during oat harvesting season in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a primary challenge for successful silage fermentation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a psychrotrophic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) L75 strain with exoploysaccharides (EPS)-producing property on fermentation quality, bacterial community, and antioxidant activity of oat silage ensiled at low temperature. The freshly chopped oat was subjected to three different treatments: i) no inoculation (control); ii) inoculated with psychrotrophic L. plantarum L75, possessing EPS-producing properties; iii) inoculated with a commercial inoculant L. plantarum. All inoculants were applied at a rate of 1 x 105 cfu/g on a fresh matter basis, and then ensiled at 25, 15, and 10 degrees C, respectively. Results indicated that the strain L75 exhibited better performance in EPS production, growth rate, and acid production compared to the commercial inoculant at low temperature. Inoculating with both strains improved the silage quality of oat forage by enhancing fermentation quality and suppressing undesirable microorganisms such as Hafnia alvei and Ewingella americana throughout the fermentation process compared to the control silage. Importantly, L75 was more effective than the commercial inoculant in enhancing fermentation quality, antioxidant activity, and the proportion of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, leading to lower dry matter loss of oat silages at low temperature. In conclusion, the psychrotrophic strain L75 with EPS-producing property has great potential to improve fermentation quality and antioxidant activities of oat silage by altering bacterial composition at low temperatures. Thus, strain L75 can be used as a candidate strain for making high-quality silage in alpine region with low temperature in forage harvesting season.

AB In this article, a novel dual-frequency-tunable metamaterial microwave sensor has been evaluated to determine the complex permittivity of the liquid materials. The presented structure consists of a dipole antenna and two pairs of varactor-loaded split-ring resonators (VLSRRs), lumped isolate inductors, and voltage tuning networks. Varactors are mounted to the capacitive regions of the VLSRRs to regulate the varactor value from 0.40 to 3.20 pF. Four variable capacitance varactors possess the capability for independent operational functionality via the voltage tuning networks. The sample under test (SUT) is contained inside the 3-D microfluidic channel. When the varactor does not work, the first and second resonant frequencies of the sensor are found to be 4.20 and 5.60 GHz, respectively. The proposed sensor enables elevated sensitivity over a broad frequency spectrum by utilizing diverse voltage tuning techniques for four varactors. The wide tuning frequency range of up to 2.0 GHz is achievable by regulating the voltages of the two resonant regions using equal values. Conversely, achieving high sensitivity requires independent control of the voltages in the two resonant regions with unequal values. Hence, the proposed sensor achieves a continuously stepped resonant frequency across a wide bandwidth, thereby enhancing sensitivity at any resonant frequency within the operational bandwidth. This novel design enables the development of a broadband tunable metamaterial sensor for predicting the dielectric permittivity of tested samples.

AB Heterogeneous sulfite-based advanced oxidation process is extremely promising for the removal of various industrial pollutants owing to its generation of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the unclear mechanism of S(IV) conversion and ROS generation hinder its practical applications. Here, the iron-copper bimetallic was synthesized for potassium pyrosulfate catalysis, which was designed for insight into the mechanism of micropollutant degradation driven by sulfur species conversion. Experimental and theoretical calculations have shown that the reaction process and corresponding mechanisms can be significantly distinguished into three different stages. Stage one prepares sufficient Fe(III) for the initiation of the reaction, while stage two generating ROS and reduces S(IV). In the stage three, the low-valent sulfur produced from S(IV) combines with iron-copper materials to form highly active sulfur sites, which react with O2 to generate a large number of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). Furthermore, a variety of contaminants were used to validate the universality of the system, and their wide distribution in wastewater implies broad application prospects. This research provides in-depth in- terpretations of the induced mechanism of sulfur species conversion in the sulfite heterogeneous system, provides a solid theoretical foundation for the engineering application of the system.

AB Outlier detection plays a crucial role in the field of data mining and machine learning. Despite the diverse range of outlier detection algorithms, most still face two main challenges: (i) the difficulty of choosing neighborhood parameter and top-n, existing algorithms can only solve one of them; (ii) the hardship of simultaneously detecting global outliers, local outliers, and outlier clusters. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a novel outlier factor, called L ocal C oulomb O utlier F actor (LCOF), inspired by Coulomb's law in physics. It can measure the outlier degree of data objects without parameters due to the use of Coulomb force and natural neighbors. LCOF first applies natural neighbors to adaptively derive the neighborhood parameter k . It further employs the interquartile range method to identify the top-n data points with the largest LCOF values as outliers. Finally, it can identify global outliers, local outliers and outlier clusters simultaneously completely without parameter k and top-n. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCOF achieves the highest average F1 and Acc scores, with a maximum value of 0.99, outperforming most existing algorithms.

AB The widespread prevalence of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) disease worldwide has impacted the livestock industry economically. No effective vaccine is available in China. In this study, we produced BCoV virus-like particles (VLPs) containing E, M, N, S, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins using a baculovirus expression system. Five recombinant baculoviruses were co-infected with Sf9 cells, and the VLPs were assembled and characterized. Mice and cattle were immunized by VLPs mixed with MF59 and CpG 55.2 adjuvants. Two doses of the VLPs/MF59/CpG vaccine were administered in mice and cattle. The immune effect of the VLPs/MF59/CpG vaccine was measured using indirect ELISA and neutralization assays. After immunization, the serum IgG-specific antibody titer against S protein and neutralization antibody titer increased to 1:1.28 x 10(4) (p < 0.01) and 1:128 (p < 0.01) in mice, respectively. Interestingly, the high IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were maintained for seven days in mice. In addition, the serum IgG-specific antibody titer against S proteins and neutralization antibody titer increased to 1:1.024 x 10(5) and 1:512 (p < 0.05) in cattle, respectively. The high IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody titers were maintained for 21 days in cattle. Notably, BCoV VLPs group interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) lymphocytes in spleens were significantly increased (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that BCoV VLPs induced strong cellular and humoral immune responses in mice and cattle. These findings suggest that BCoV VLPs could serve as a potent immunogen for vaccine development.

AB Endoperoxides are important sources of ideas for drug discovery. Endoperoxide bonds are considered to be the cause of the interesting biological activities of endoperoxides, but there is limited knowledge regarding the biosynthetic mechanisms of most endoperoxide bonds. In this minireview, we summarize current knowledge about the biosynthesis of endoperoxides in nature and focus our discussion on plant-derived endoperoxides. In short, plants have evolved two systems, photocatalysis and enzyme catalysis, to catalyse the synthesis of endoperoxide bonds. Iron-dependent oxygenases, represented by the alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG)-dependent dioxygenase (2-ODD) family, are most likely involved in the enzyme-catalysed reactions of endoperoxides in plants. Moreover, Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC, a plant native to the Himalayan alpine region, is strongly recommended for use in the discovery of plant-derived endoperoxidases.

DE Power systems; multiple-resource delays; load frequency control;

AB This paper considers intelligent event-triggered H-infinity Load Frequency Control (LFC) for a new kind of multi-area power system. Firstly, delay factors are introduced into the prime mover, engine, and energy storage unit, i.e, multiple-resource delays, and the impact of these delays on the dynamic behavior of system is discussed for the first time, making the model more realistic and accurate. Secondly, a new lemma is proposed, which introduces free variables, extending to the scenarios with time delays. Combining this lemma with the event-triggered mechanism, the control scheme is designed, which is featured by two characteristics. On the one hand, in the Lyapunov functional, looped terms on neighbor triggering instants are considered, reduce the conservatism of the obtained criteria by capturing the information of triggered instants. Meanwhile, a mandatory triggering mechanism is introduced to break the possible dead loop caused by long-term no-triggering. On the other hand, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the parameters of the trigger threshold, encouraging efficient control within the context of LFC and delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by a typical numerical example with four case studies.

AB Zearalenone (ZEN), a mycotoxin from Fusarium fungi, impairs fertility and milk production in female animals; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using the bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) as the model, this study investigated the impacts of ZEN on programmed cell death (PCD) and milk fat synthesis and explored the underlying mechanism. We found that 10 ng/mL prolactin (PRL) notably enhanced the differentiation of MAC-T cells, promoting the expression of genes related to the synthesis of milk fat, protein, and lactose. Next, the toxic effects of different doses of ZEN on the differentiated MAC-T with PRL treatment were determined. 10 and 20 mu M ZEN significantly reduced cell viability, induced oxidative stress, and triggered PCD (e.g., apoptosis and necrosis). Notably, ZEN exposure downregulated the mRNA/protein levels of critical factors involved in milk fat synthesis by disrupting the AKT-mTOR-PPAR gamma-ACSL4 pathway. Interestingly, melatonin (MT), known for its antioxidant properties, protected against the above ZEN-induced effects by enhancing the binding of PPAR gamma to the promoter regions of ACSL4, which led to the upregulated expression of the ACSL4 gene. These results underscored the potential of MT to mitigate the adverse effects of ZEN on mammary cells, highlighting a way for potential therapeutic intervention.
   This study investigated the effects of zearalenone (ZEN) on programmed cell death (PCD) and milk fat synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T) and explored its underlying mechanisms. ZEN exposure triggered oxidative stress, induced PCD, and impaired milk fat synthesis by disrupting the AKT-mTOR-PPAR gamma-ACSL4 pathway. Interestingly, melatonin (MT), known for its antioxidant properties, protected cells from ZEN-induced toxicity by enhancing PPAR gamma binding to the ACSL4 promoter region.
   Mycotoxin (e.g., Zearalenone, ZEN) widely exists in contaminated animal feeds and affects health. This study investigated the impacts of ZEN on programmed cell death (PCD, e.g., apoptosis and necrosis) and milk fat synthesis in MAC-T cells. ZEN exposure led to decreased cell viability, increased oxidative stress, and induced PCD. Additionally, ZEN disrupted the AKT-mTOR-PPAR gamma-ACSL4 pathway, resulting in the inhibition of milk fat synthesis. Melatonin (MT) partially mitigated ZEN-induced adverse effects by enhancing PPAR gamma binding to ACSL4 promoter regions. Overall, ZEN exposure resulted in PCD and impaired milk fat synthesis via repressing the AKT-mTOR-PPAR gamma-ACSL4 pathway in MAC-T cells, while MT potentially offered detoxification against ZEN-induced mammary toxicity.

AB Intramuscular adipogenesis plays an important role in muscle development, which determines the quality of goat meat. However, its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we provided detailed cellular atlases of goat longissimus dorsi during muscle development at single-nucleus resolution, and identified the subpopulations of fibroblasts/fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and muscle satellite cell (MuSC), as well as the differentiation trajectory of FAPs subpopulations. Cellular ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed enriched BMP and IGF pathways implicated in within-tissue crosstalk centered around FAPs. Through single-nucleus gene regulatory network analysis and in vitro interference verification, we found that TCF7L2 was a critical transcriptional factor (TF) in early adipogenesis in skeletal muscle. Overall, our work reveals the cellular intricacies and diversity of goat longissimus dorsi during muscle development, implementing insights into the critical roles of BMP, IGF pathways and TCF7L2 TF in intramuscular adipogenesis.

TI Lamellar conducting channels constructed by lyotropic liquid crystals as
   quasi-solid-state electrolytes toward dye-sensitized solar cells
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
LA English
DT Article
AB Developing high-performance electrolytes combining high efficiency and durability remains challenging for energy devices. Herein, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) electrolytes (Brij58-LLCn) were designed for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on commercially available polyethylene glycol-20-hexadecyl ether (Brij58) in combination with different weight contents (30%, 40%, and 50%) of a liquid electrolyte (LE). The liquid crystal behavior, molecular arrangement, electrochemical performance, and DSSC performance of Brij58-LLCn were investigated. Self-assembly of Brij58 and a LE formed a lamellar phase with a focal conic texture. The LE was concentrated to construct layered conducting channels and these channels were expanded by increasing the LE, which was beneficial for charge transfer. The best ionic conductivity of 9.01 mS cm-1 was achieved by Brij58-LLC50. DSSCs containing Brij58-LLCn exhibited promising photovoltaic performance and satisfactory thermal stability. The introduction of commercial Brij58 has extended the path of constructing 'liquid' channels in lyotropic liquid crystals for enhancing the performance of energy devices, which provides new ideas for the development of electrolytes in advanced energy devices.

AB Plant roots show flexible traits to changing precipitation, but the factors driving root trait covariation remain poorly understood. This study investigated six key root traits and explored the potential driving factors, including plant community characteristics and soil properties, in the Zoige alpine meadow across five precipitation gradients: natural precipitation (1.0P), a 50% increasing precipitation (1.5P), and 30%, 50% and 90% decreasing precipitation (0.7P, 0.5P and 0.1P, respectively). Our results demonstrated distinct root trait responses to changes in precipitation. Both increasing (1.5P) and decreasing precipitation (0.1P, 0.5P and 0.7P) inhibited root diameter (RD), specific root length (SRL) and specific root area compared with 1.0P. Conversely, root tissue density and root nitrogen content increased under decreasing precipitation but declined under 1.5P. With increasing precipitation, root foraging strategies shifted with thinner RD and larger SRL to that with a larger diameter. Shifts in root strategies were primarily influenced by soil properties, specifically soil water content and available nitrogen. Additionally, root strategies in surface soils (0-10 cm) were mainly related to the grass and sedge coverage, whereas in deeper soils (10-20 cm) root strategies were related to overall plant community coverage and biomass. Our findings indicate that root trait variations and strategies in alpine meadows are co-driven by soil properties and plant communities in response to changing precipitation.

AB Dwarf plant architecture facilitates dense planting, and increased planting densities boost the maize yield. However, breeding applications of dwarfing materials for maize are currently limited. There is an urgent need remove the obstacles to applying dwarf resources. Here, we innovated a new method to add a novel maize dwarf germplasm through the distant hybridization of Maize-Tripsacum-Teosinte allopolyploid (MTP) with maize. We identified ten independent dwarf families with unique characteristics. Five germplasms in our library were controlled by their respective dwarf genes. However, no allele was controlled by Br2. Subsequently, d024 in the library was successfully fine mapped, revealing its linkage to indel-4 in ZmCYP90D1. The indel-4 polymorphism regulates the expression of ZmCYP90D1 and is controlled by an upstream transcription factor (ZmBES1/BZR1-5). The indel-4 of ZmCYP90D1 allele, which reduces plant height, originated from Tripsacum, a wild variety of maize. However, d024 exhibits sensitivity to brassinosteroids (BRs), with lower castasterone levels in the internodes than that in the wild type. Furthermore, ZmCYP90D1 interacted with ZmFDXs and ZmNAD(P)H to positively regulate the downstream BR synthesis pathway. Additionally, we showed that introgressing the indel-4 of the Tripsacum allele into modern hybrids ensures yield potential and improves the harvest index under high-density conditions. Overall, as we begin to manufacture highly engineered dwarf materials using the MTP, this approach will solve the problems faced by corn dwarfs.

AB School readiness has a profound educational value for children's positive adjustment to primary school and holistic development. However, little research sufficiently addresses how young children view multifaceted components of learning, such as cognitive, affective and behavioural experiences on school readiness. A timely understanding of children's perceptions and experiences is crucial to shed light on how to promote transition and improve children's school readiness. This study investigated the perceptions and experiences of 41 children in China (5-6 years of age, 23 girls) regarding their school readiness based on Mosaic approach methods. The results indicated that young children have their own unique perceptions, emotional and behavioural experiences of school readiness. The perceptions of school readiness include four aspects of material supplies, subjects knowledge, interests and specialties and behavioural habits, which has similarities to that of adults in aspects of academic knowledge and social rules. Nevertheless, findings revealed young children view interests and strengths as important part of school readiness, reflecting their personal preferences and abilities. The emotional experiences could be considered positive or negative, with positive emotional experiences expressing children's curiosity and expectation, fulfilment and pleasure, and negative emotional experiences expressing academic burden, rules pressure and social worries, which need to be addressed. Young children's behavioural experiences with school readiness present two patterns of passive acceptance and active participation, they are eager to participate in activities and have a strong desire to explore and learn. Our findings extend beyond existing conception of school readiness, and give greater weight to children's interests and strengths, positive experiences and active participation. It is important to focus on children's intrinsic interests and strengths, accept children's ideas and choices, care for their emotional state and provide positive support.

AB The experiment was to compare the effects of switching all-concentrate to all-roughage diets on rumen microflora and functional metabolism of yak, cattle-yak, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle living in different altitudes. A total of 24 yaks, cattle-yaks, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle with a similar weight and good body condition aged 3.5 years were selected and divided into four groups according to species. They were fed a concentrate diet with 40% soybean meal and 60% corn meal for the first month (C group) and a roughage diet with dry corn stalks (100%) for the second month (R group); the formal experimental period was 60 d. These results showed that the conversion had a significant effect on the rumen microflora structure of the four herds, and the biggest difference between concentrate and roughage diets was yak and cattle-yak, followed by Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes still predominate in all groups. Compared with the C groups, the relative abundance of Lentisphaerae and Kiritimatiellaeota increased in all R groups, and Lentisphaerae was significantly increased in yak and cattle-yak (p < 0.05). At the genus and species levels, Prevotella had the highest abundance, and the relative abundances of Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Sarcina and Ruminobacter in R groups were lower, while the abundances of other differential genera, including Methanobrevibacter, Fibrobacter, Treponema, Eubacterium, Butyrivibrio, Succinivibrio and Succinimonas, were all higher. Roughage diets increased the number of unique genes and functional genes encoding different CAZymes in rumen microorganisms in all four herds. In the functional contribution analysis, with the exception of ABC transporters and methane metabolism, Prevotella was the main contributor to almost all of these functions. In methane metabolism, Methanobrevibacter had the highest relative abundance, followed by Prevotella, Clostridia and Bacteroidales in all groups. Compared with Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle, yaks and cattle-yaks have better adaptability to roughage, and its utilization rate can be fully improved to reduce methane emission. The study indicates that when four herds are converted to high roughage at the later stage of feeding, the growth and reproduction of rumen microorganisms are affected, and the abundance and diversity of rumen microorganisms are increased to varying degrees. The transformation of concentrate to roughage diet can change the metabolic pathways of rumen microorganisms in yaks and finally affect the fermentation mode of rumen. The above results provide a theoretical basis for the research and development of fattening feeds for yaks, cattle-yaks, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle and the intensive feeding of livestock on the plateau.

AB Red blood cells (RBCs) naturally trap some bacterial pathogens in the circulation and kill them by oxidative stress. Following neutralization, the bacteria are presented to antigen-presenting cells in the spleen by the RBCs. This ability of RBCs has been harnessed to develop a system where they play a crucial role in enhancing the immune response, offering a novel approach to enhance the body's immunity. In this work, a conjugate, G-OVA, was formed by connecting beta-glucan and OVA through a disulfide bond. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was then employed to encapsulate G-OVA, yielding G-OVA-PLGA. Finally, the nanoparticles were adsorbed onto RBCs to develop G-OVA-PLGA@RBC. The results demonstrated that the delivery of nanoparticles by RBCs enhanced the antibody response to antigens both in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this study was to investigate the increased immune activity of G-OVA-PLGA nanoparticles facilitated by RBCs transportation and to elucidate some of its underlying mechanisms. These findings are anticipated to contribute valuable insights for the development of efficient and safe immune enhancers.

AB Transition metal-catalyzed cleavage and reconstruction of the C-P bond provides a highly efficient and rapid method for the transformation of organophosphine compounds. In this study, a novel and general protocol for the palladium-catalyzed C(sp(3))-P(V) bond cleavage of free alpha-aminophosphonates and subsequent functionalization via C-P bond recombination has been developed. The reaction exhibits high reactivity between the C(sp(3))-P bond and halides, accommodating a wide range of substrates and enabling the rapid synthesis of aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl organophosphine molecules. Additionally, the synthetic utility is validated by gram-scale synthesis, and the reaction process is corroborated by mechanistic experiments.

AB This study investigates the impact of broadband infrastructure on the labour share. We exploit the implementation of the 'Broadband China Strategy' (BCS) as an exogenous policy shock and use the staggered difference-in-differences framework with a panel dataset of Chinese industrial enterprises spanning 2011-2015. We find that the BCS leads to a significant reduction in the labour income share of firms in pilot cities compared with those in non-pilot cities, which remains robust after conducting various robustness checks. Rising market power and deepening capital are the two mechanisms underlying this effect. While our further analysis underscores significantly positive impact of broadband infrastructure on firm productivity and skilled labour structure, they do not highlight an elevated skill premium tied to broadband infrastructure. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effects are more pronounced among larger firms, industries with higher concentrations, and cities with higher innovation capacities. Overall, this study augments the existing literature on the firm-level determinants of labour share, providing a micro-level assessment of the labour market implications of broadband infrastructure.

AB Intergroup contact has been reliably associated with reduced prejudice and improved intergroup relations in research; however, relatively little is known about the association between intergroup contact and psychological capital. Guided by the tertiary transfer effect of intergroup contact, this study examined the latter association. A total of 1501 adolescents (M = 15.72 years, 55.8 % female) from areas in China mainly inhabited by ethnic minorities participated in this study. Latent profile analysis revealed that psychological capital could be classified into four different types: lowest (7.1 %), lower (51.0 %), mid (34.5 %), and high (7.3 %). Multinomial logistic regression revealed a positive association between contact quality (but not contact quantity and the product of contact quantity and quality) and the odds of adolescents being classified into the lower, mid, and high groups when compared to the lowest group. Moreover, the association between contact quality and being classified into the high group, compared to the lowest group, was stronger for boys than for girls. The implications of these findings are discussed in both theoretical and practical terms.

AB Vanadium dioxide (VO2) 2 ) is an excellent phase transition material widely used in various applications, and thus inevitably enters the environment via different routes and encounters various organisms. Nonetheless, limited information is available on the environmental hazards of VO2. 2 . In this study, we investigated the impact of two commercial VO2 2 particles, nanosized S-VO2 2 and micro-sized M-VO2 2 on the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. . The growth of P. chrysosporium is significantly affected by VO2 2 particles, with S-VO2 2 displaying a higher inhibitory effect on weight gain. In addition, VO2 2 at high concentrations inhibits the formation of fungal fibrous hyphae and disrupts the integrity of fungus cells as evidenced by the cell membrane damage and the loss of cytoplasm. Notably, at 200 mu g/mL, S-VO2 2 completely alters the morphology of P. chrysosporium, , while the MVO2 2 treatment does not affect the mycelium formation of P. chrysosporium. . Additionally, VO2 2 particles inhibit the laccase activity secreted by P. chrysosporium, , and thus prevent the dye decoloration and sawdust decomposition by P. chrysosporium. . The mechanism underlying this toxicity is related to the dissolution of VO2 2 and the oxidative stress induced by VO2. 2 . Overall, our findings suggest that VO2 2 nanoparticles pose significant environmental hazards and risks to white rot fungi.

ID URBAN; URBANIZATION; AREAS
AB The various hydrological processes that cause waterlogging exhibit regional differences. Studies on the causes of waterlogging in Chinese southern hilly cities from the perspective of urban regional hydrological processes are needed. This article examines Changsha Central City to study the hydrological processes of Chinese southern hilly cities based on waterlogging point data from 2015 to 2017, analyzing the relationships between the degree of waterlogging and changes in the material elements of runoff sources, runoff convergence terminals, and runoff convergence processes using correlation analysis, principal component analysis and comparative analysis. These results show that the urban waterlogging in Chinese southern hilly cities is caused by the hardening of convergence spaces, concentrated water distribution, a decrease in the connectivity of rainwater corridors, complex topographic slopes, and a lag in the construction of drainage facilities. The expansion of impervious surfaces, particularly in areas intended for convergence terminals, has significantly reduced the number of these critical structures. Additionally, disordered changes in topographic slopes, the division caused by roads, and the hardening of underlying surfaces in rainwater corridors have collectively diminished the structural and ecological connectivity of the rainwater corridor system. This obstruction of surface runoff into concentrated water bodies has rendered the runoff regulation function of these water bodies ineffective, making their size a leading cause of urban waterlogging. To mitigate the risk of waterlogging, Chinese southern hilly cities should prevent urban development from encroaching on natural runoff areas. They should also implement dispersed water body layouts, enhance both the structural and ecological connectivity of rainwater corridors and their underlying surfaces, and improve the design standards of drainage facilities.
