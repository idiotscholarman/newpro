ID WIDE ASSOCIATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MODEL APPROACH
AB Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction/selection (GP/GS) are the two essential enterprises in genomic research. Due to the great magnitude and complexity of genomic and phenotypic data, analytical methods and their associated software packages are frequently advanced. GAPIT is a widely-used genomic association and prediction integrated tool as an R package. The first version was released to the public in 2012 with the implementation of the general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), compressed MLM (CMLM), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). The second version was released in 2016 with several new implementations, including enriched CMLM (ECMLM) and settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). All the GWAS methods are based on the single-locus test. For the first time, in the current release of GAPIT, version 3 implemented three multi-locus test methods, including multiple loci mixed model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK). Ad-ditionally, two GP/GS methods were implemented based on CMLM (named compressed BLUP; cBLUP) and SUPER (named SUPER BLUP; sBLUP). These new implementations not only boost statistical power for GWAS and prediction accuracy for GP/GS, but also improve computing speed and increase the capacity to analyze big genomic data. Here, we document the current upgrade of GAPIT by describing the selection of the recently developed methods, their im-plementations, and potential impact. All documents, including source code, user manual, demo data, and tutorials, are freely available at the GAPIT website (http://zzlab.net/GAPIT).

AB Based on the contributions of carbon nanostructures and their composited species, great advances in electromagnetic wave interference shielding have been achieved. In this article, recent progress in electromagnetic wave shielding enabled by the synergism of carbon nanostructures and their corresponding composites is discussed encompassing the factors of microstructural defects, filler concentration, filler alignment, filler inherent conductivity and the surrounding temperature. Carbon nanostructures and their composites would energize the advanced electromagnetic wave shielding because of their light weight, high corrosion resistance, excellent thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, broad absorption frequency bandwidth and cost-effectiveness. In this context of identifying suitable carbon composites that can enhance electromagnetic wave absorption. This review provides updated electromagnetic wave shielding knowledge of carbon nanostructures and their composites as well as their prospects and challenges. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid development of electronic devices have brought increased concern on electromagnetic radiation (EMR) problems. The radiated EM waves can not only affect the normal operation of devices, but also threat people's health. The most effective way to solve the EM pollution is to fabricate electromagnetic interference shielding materials (ESMs) and microwave absorption materials (MAMs) with lightweight, strong attenuation ability, and excellent mechanical stability. In this case, carbon materials and their nanocomposites attracted great attentions in the fields of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding due to the advantages of low density, natural abundance, easy preparation, excellent conductivity and flexibility. In this review, we firstly carried out a summary of recent achievements for carbon materials with different microstructures as ESMs/MAMs during the past five years. It is found that 3D carbon materials such as foams, sponges, and aerogels, as well as their composites are favorable for enhancing the EMI shielding efficiency. Then we introduced the latest progress of novel composites including MXene/carbon composites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) derived porous carbon nanocomposites. In the end, current challenges and prospects were proposed toward the development of carbon based materials as ESMs/MAMs, which indicated the trend and key point for future research.

AB In this work, the hierarchical NiS microflowers were synthesized using Ni(OH)(2) as precursors through sulfuration process. The microstructure and chemical composition of as-prepared NiS was confirmed by means of SEM, TEM, XRD, BET and XPS. The SEM analysis results demonstrated that the NiS microflowers were composed of hierarchical nanoplates, and its surface was much rougher compared to that of Ni(OH)(2) templates after sulfidation. Electrochemical characterization revealed that NiS presented high specific capacitance in 3 M KOH electrolyte (1122.7 F.g(-1) at current density of 1 A.g(-1)) and good electro-chemical cycling stability (97.8% of the specific capacitance is retained after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at current density of 10 A.g(-1)). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor, NiS as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, delivered high energy density of 31 Wh.kg(-1) at power density of 0.9 kW.kg(-1) under operating voltage window of 1.8 V.

AB Plasmonic metal-semiconductor nanostructures endow them with an enormous potential application in photocatalysis, however, the uniform deposition of metal NPs as small as a few nanometers remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of two-step polymer-network gel process in the synthesis of Ag-ZnO nanocatalyst with superior photocatalytic properties. Because of uniform distributed Ag NPs, large specific surface area and abundant surface oxygen vacancies, the Ag-ZnO nanoparticles exhibit a super high photocatalytic efficiency in comparison to pure ZnO nanoparticles. The efficiency can be further improved by optimizing the external factors, such as catalyst dosage, ambient temperature and initial solution pH. Good stability and practicability indicate its potential application in environmental purification. Our work does not only provide a feasible strategy for the synthesis of high property Ag-ZnO nanophotocatalysts, but also enriches the understanding of metal-metal oxide nanostructures.

AB This paper investigates the issue of the reliable asynchronous sampled-data filtering of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy delayed neural networks with stochastic intermittent faults, randomly occurring time-varying parameters uncertainties and controller gain fluctuation. The asynchronous phenomenon occurs between the system modes and controller modes. First, in order to reduce the utilization rate of communication bandwidth, a novel alterable sampled-data terminal method is considered via variable sampling rates. Second, based on the fuzzy-model-based control approach, improved reciprocally convex inequality and new parametertime-dependent discontinuous Lyapunov approach, several relaxed conditions are derived and compared with the existing work. Third, the intermittent fault-tolerance scheme is also taken into fully account in designing a reliable asynchronous sampled-data controller, which ensures such that the resultant neural networks is asymptotically stable. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising approach for upgrading excessive CO2 into value-added chemicals, while the exquisite control of the catalyst atomic structures to obtain high C2+ alcohol selectivity has remained challenging due to the intrinsically favored ethylene pathways at Cu surface. Herein, we demonstrate a rational strategy to achieve similar to 70% faradaic efficiency toward C2+ alcohols. We utilized a CO-rich environment to construct Cu catalysts with stepped sites that enabled high surface coverages of *CO intermediates and the bridge-bound *CO adsorption, which allowed to trigger CO2 reduction pathways toward the formation alcohols. Using this defect-site-rich Cu catalyst, we achieved C2+ alcohols with partial current densities of > 100 mA.cm(-2) in both a flow-cell electrolyzer and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. A stable alcohol faradaic efficiency of similar to 60% was also obtained, with similar to 500 mg C2+ alcohol production per cm(2) catalyst during a continuous 30-h operation.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, known as Dang Gui (in Chinese), is a traditional medicinal and edible plant that has long been used for tonifying, replenishing, and invigorating blood as well as relieving pain, lubricating the intestines, and treating female irregular menstruation and amenorrhea. A. sinensis has also been used as a health product and become increasingly popular in China, Japan, and Korea.
   Aim of the review: This paper aims to provide a systemic review of traditional uses of A. sinensis and its recent advances in the fields of phytochemistry, analytical methods and toxicology. In addition, possible trends, therapeutic potentials, and perspectives for future research of this plant are also briefly discussed.
   Materials and methods: An extensive review of the literature was conducted, and electronic databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Reaxys were used to assemble the data. Ethnopharmacological literature and digitalised sources of academic libraries were also systematically searched. In addition, information was obtained from local books and The Plant List (TPL, www.theplantlist.org).
   Result: This study reviews the progress in chemical analysis of A. sinensis and its preparations. Previously and newly established methods, including spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra-performance liquid chromatography(UPLC), and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (NMR), are summarized. Moreover, identified bioactive components such as polysaccharides, ligustilide and ferulic acid were reviewed, along with analytical methods for quantitative and qualitative determination of target analytes, and fingerprinting authentication, quality evaluation of A. sinensis, and toxicology and pharmacodynamic studies. Scientific reports on crude extracts and pure compounds and formulations revealed a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory activity, antifibrotic action, antispasmodic activity, antioxidant activities, and neuroprotective action, as well as cardio- and cerebrovascular effects.
   Conclusions: Within the published scientific literature are numerous reports regarding analytical methods that use various chromatographic and spectrophotometric technologies to monitor various types of components with different physicochemical properties simultaneously. This review discusses the reasonable selection of marker compounds based on high concentrations, analytical methods, and commercial availabilities with the goal of developing quick, accurate, and applicable analytical approaches for quality evaluation and establishing harmonised criteria for the analysis of A. sinensis and its finished products. Compounds isolated from A. sinensis are abundant sources of chemical diversity, from which we can discover active molecules. Thus, more studies on the pharmacological mechanisms of the predominant active compounds of A. sinensis are needed. In addition, given that A. sinensis is one of the most popular traditional herbal medicines, its main therapeutic aspects, toxicity, and adverse effects warrant further investigation in the future.

AB Electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide (CO) has recently emerged as a potential approach for obtaining high-value, multicarbon products such as acetate, while the activity and selectivity for prodution of acetate have remained low. Herein, we develop an atomically ordered copper-palladium intermetallic compound (CuPd) composed of a high density of Cu-Pd pairs that feature as catalytic sites to enrich surface *CO coverage, stabilize ethenone as a key acetate path intermediate and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus substantially promoting acetate formation. The CuPd electrocatalyst enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 70 +/- 5% for CO-to-acetate electroreduction and a high acetate partial current density of 425 mA cm(-2). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, the CuPd electrocatalyst demonstrated a 500 h CO-to-acetate conversion at 500 mA cm(-2) with a stable acetate Faradaic efficiency of similar to 50%.

AB Developing an effective theranostic nanoplatform remains a great challenge for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, BiOI@Bi2S3@BSA (bovine serum albumin) semiconductor heterojunction nanoparticles (SHNPs) for triple-combination radio/photodynamic/photothermal cancer therapy and multimodal computed tomography/photoacoustic (CT/PA) bioimaging are reported. On the one hand, SHNPs possess strong X-ray attenuation capability since they contain high-Z elements, and thus they are anticipated to be a very competent candidate as radio-sensitizing materials for radiotherapy enhancement. On the other hand, as a semiconductor, the as-prepared SHNPs offer an extra approach for reactive oxygen species generation based on electron-hole pair under the irradiation of X-ray through the photodynamic therapy process. This X-ray excited photodynamic therapy obviously has better penetration depth in bio-tissue. What's more, the SHNPs also possess well photothermal conversion efficiency for photothermal therapy, because Bi2S3 is a thin band semiconductor with strong near-infrared absorption that can cause local overheat. In vivo tumor ablation studies show that synergistic radio/photodynamic/photothermal therapy achieves more significant therapeutic effect than any single treatment. In addition, with the strong X-ray attenuation and high near-infrared absorption, the as-obtained SHNPs can also be applied as a multimodal contrast agent in CT/PA imaging.

AB Root exudates are an essential carrier for material cycling, energy exchange, and information transfer between the belowground parts of plants and the soil. We synthesize current properties and regulators of root exudates and their role in the belowground ecosystem as substances cycle and signal regulation. We discussed the composition and amount of root exudates and their production mechanism, indicating that plant species, growth stage, environmental factors, and microorganisms are primary influence factors. The specific mechanisms by which root secretions mobilize the soil nutrients were summarized. First, plants improve the nutrient status of the soil by releasing organic acids for acidification and chelation. Then, root exudates accelerated the SOC turnover due to their dual impacts, forming and destabilizing aggregates and MASOC. Eventually, root exudates mediate the plant-plant interaction and plant-microbe interaction. Additionally, a summary of the current collection methods of root exudates is presented.

AB This paper deals with the non-fragile memory filtering issue of T-S fuzzy delayed neural networks with randomly occurring time-varying parameters uncertainties and variable sampling rates. Compared with existing sampled-data control schemes, an improved switched fuzzy memory sampled-data control protocol is designed for the first time, which involves not only a signal transmission delay but also switched topologies. By developing some new terms and taking full advantage of the variable characteristics related to the actual sampling pattern, a modified loose-looped fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed based on the information of the time derivative of FMFs. Meanwhile, some relaxed matrices chosen in LKF are not consequentially positive definite. Moreover, with the LKF methodology and employing the developed estimation technique, several optimized control algorithms with both a larger sampling period and upper bound of time-varying delays for achieving the stabilization of the resultant T-S fuzzy delayed neural networks are derived. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the superiority and applicability of the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid industrialization leads to increased wastewater discharge encompassing hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which leads to serious environmental problems of toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. Removal of these species is normally carried out by ion-exchange, precipitation, membrane filtration, sorption, photocatalytic reduction, etc. This review mainly focuses on the photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of Cr (VI), because of their advantages over other methods such as reduced risk of secondary pollution by non-reduced Cr (VI), no sludge formation, no need for a large amount of chemical reagents, clean and easy installation. The main factors influencing the photocatalytic reduction efficiency of Cr (VI) such as catalyst activity, solution pH, Cr adsorption on the catalyst and additives, are briefly discussed. Finally, a special emphasis is provided to the photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of Cr (VI).

AB Recently, network function virtualization (NFV) has been proposed to solve the dilemma faced by traditional networks and to improve network performance through hardware and software decoupling. The deployment of the service function chain (SFC) is a key technology that affects the performance of virtual network function (VNF). The key issue in the deployment of SFCs is proposing effective algorithms to achieve efficient use of resources. In this article, we propose an SFC deployment optimization (SFCDO) algorithm based on a breadth-first search (BFS). The algorithm first uses a BFS-based algorithm to find the shortest path between the source node and the destination node. Then, based on the shortest path, the path with the fewest hops is preferentially chosen to implement the SFC deployment. Finally, we compare the performances with the greedy and simulated annealing (G-SA) algorithm. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is optimized in terms of end-to-end delay and bandwidth resource consumption. In addition, we also consider the load rate of the nodes to achieve network load balancing.

AB Here, the authors develop a polyphenol-based single-cell coating that forms a nanoarmor on the surface of probiotics, showing that protects from a wide range of antibiotics and enhances probiotic action against antibiotic-mediated diarrhea.
   The gut microbiota represents a large community of microorganisms that play an important role in immune regulation and maintenance of homeostasis. Living bacteria receive increasing interest as potential therapeutics for gut disorders, because they inhibit the colonization of pathogens and positively regulate the composition of bacteria in gut. However, these treatments are often accompanied by antibiotic administration targeting pathogens. In these cases, the efficacy of therapeutic bacteria is compromised by their susceptibility to antibiotics. Here, we demonstrate that a single-cell coating composed of tannic acids and ferric ions, referred to as 'nanoarmor', can protect bacteria from the action of antibiotics. The nanoarmor protects both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria against six clinically relevant antibiotics. The multiple interactions between the nanoarmor and antibiotic molecules allow the antibiotics to be effectively absorbed onto the nanoarmor. Armored probiotics have shown the ability to colonize inside the gastrointestinal tracts of levofloxacin-treated rats, which significantly reduced antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) resulting from the levofloxacin-treatment and improved some of the pre-inflammatory symptoms caused by AAD. This nanoarmor strategy represents a robust platform to enhance the potency of therapeutic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of patients receiving antibiotics and to avoid the negative effects of antibiotics in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB Noble metal-metal oxide nanohybrids play an ever-increasing role in photocatalytic applications. Here, a ZnO-Ag nanoparticle prepared by a modified polymer-network gel method was utilized for room temperature light-assisted NO2 gas detection. Since a heterojunction forms between the two materials and surface oxygen vacancies increase, the sensitivities of the sensors to NO2 gas (0.5-5 ppm) under various light (lambda = 365-520 nm) illumination conditions are enhanced in comparison with those of pure ZnO sensor. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was found to result in the excellent visible-light performance of this ZnO-Ag nanostructure. More importantly, by tuning the working wavelength using different LED light sources, we can obtain an optimized sensitivity. When blue-green LED (470 nm, 75 mW/cm(2)) is used, the 3 mol% Ag-loaded ZnO sensor shows the highest sensitivity as well as superior stability and selectivity. The effect of humidity on the sensor performance is also discussed in detail. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon black (CB)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposites with a range of nanoparticle loadings were prepared successfully by using a joint co-coagulation technique and hot pressing. The presence of hydrogen bonding interactions between the CB particles and TPU chains was identified from the results of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Uniform dispersion of CB particles throughout the TPU matrix improved the overall mechanical properties of the TPU nanocomposites, as compared with the neat TPU. The thermal conductivity and thermal stability of the CB/TPU nanocomposites were also found to be enhanced with increasing the CB loading. All samples exhibited a rapid increase of erosion rate with the impact velocity between 20 and 30 m/s. The largest and smallest erosion rates (ER) were observed at 30 degrees and 90 degrees impact angle, respectively, for all CB/TPU nanocomposites. This shows a typical ductile erosion behavior in this material. In addition, the ER (TPU-2CB > TPU-12CB > TPU > TPU-6CB) under all test conditions showed an opposite trend to the tensile strength. These results indicate that the CB/TPU nanocomposites are suitable for protective coatings.

AB The demand for environmental monitoring and remediation stimulates tremendous research efforts to develop highly efficient and advanced functional nanomaterials capable of combining multiple functions with the arbitrary switching of application scenarios. However, there remains a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the multiple properties and the surface structure of the nanomaterials, which is crucial for the design and application of advanced functional nanomaterials. Here, we present a feasibility demonstration of a single ZnO nanorod-based material platform that uniquely synergizes several highly desired capabilities for gas sensing, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic applications. In such a nanomaterial platform, a research route and elaborate experiments uncover the surface structure-property relationships of the facet effect in conjunction with first-principles density functional theory calculations, identifying the defect effects of the dominant exposed (100) surfaces of the hydrothermally synthesized ZnO nanorods. The smaller diameter and higher density of the ZnO array remarkably promote the exposure area to the surrounding and surface oxygen vacancy amount as well as O-2 and H2O adsorption. Furthermore, the visible light absorption was enhanced by the raising valence band maximum position stemming from the enhanced surface oxygen vacancies. Importantly, this work offers unprecedented insights into the fundamental understanding of the essence behind the realization of multiple functions on a single nanomaterial platform, which could significantly boost the efficiency and reliability of miniaturized high-technology assets and other critical equipment, enabling the development and optimization of high-performance multifunctional electronics.

AB Energy crisis and atmospheric contamination urgently warrants the low-energy consumption and scalable hazardous gas detection for environmental government. However, most of existing gas sensors are restricted by tremendous power supply and burdensome maintenance as well as bulky volume. Herein, a core-shell structured smart textile (CST) was constructed via coaxial electrospinning to synchronously and sympatrically couple the piezoelectric transduction of polyvinylidene fluoride/lead zirconate titanate (PVDF/PZT) core layer and chemoresistor-sensing of polyaniline/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PANI/PVP) shell layer in a single fiber, enabling autonomous and simultaneous monitoring of pressure and concentration of NO2 gas. The three basic gas sensing attributes of receptor function, transducer function and utility factor of the sensing body can be concurrently modulated/optimized by tuning the composition and mesoscopic configuration of porosity and sensing-transducing component ratio. A high sensitivity of 0.32 ppm(-1), low detection limit (similar to 100 ppb) and good selectivity was achieved toward NO2 detection. Furthermore, the as-prepared CST demonstrates great capability in simultaneous gas pressure (57 mV/KPa) and concentration detection. By combining theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, a sensing mechanism was established to well unravel/predict the gas sensing behaviors. This work opens a new paradigm for constructing active multifunctional environmental sensors and multimodal smart textiles.

AB Radioresistance is one of the undesirable impediments in hypoxic tumors, which sharply diminishes the therapeutic effectiveness of radiotherapy and eventually results in the failure of their treatments. An attractive strategy for attenuating radioresistance is developing an ideal radiosensitization system with appreciable radiosensitization capacity to attenuate tumor hypoxia and reinforce radiotherapy response in hypoxic tumors. Therefore, we describe the development of Gd-containing polyoxometalates-conjugated chitosan (GdW10@CS nanosphere) as a radio sensitization system for simultaneous extrinsic and intrinsic radiosensitization, by generating an overabundance of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) using high-energy X-ray stimulation and mediating the hypoxia-inducible factor-la (HIF-la) siRNA to down-regulate HIF-la expression and suppress broken double-stranded DNA self-healing. Most importantly, the GdW10@CS nanospheres have the capacity to promote the exhaustion of intracellular glutathione (reduced GSH) by synergy W6+-triggered GSH oxidation for sufficient ROS generation, thereby facilitating the therapeutic efficiency of radiotherapy. As a result, the as-synthesized GdW10@CS nanosphere can overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors through a simultaneous extrinsic and intrinsic strategy to improve radiosensitivity. We have demonstrated GdW10@CS nanospheres with special radiosensitization behavior, which provides a versatile approach to solve the critical radioresistance issue of hypoxic tumors.

AB Oil/water separation becomes a research hotspot because of the frequent oil spill accidents. Although lots of separating membranes with super-wettability have been fabricated to separate oil or water from the mixtures, to separate both heavy (rho(oil) > rho(water)) and light (rho(oil) < rho(water)) oil/water mixtures with high efficiency and high flux is still a challenge, especially to obtain a membrane with mechanically robust nanostructures, and simultaneously anti-corrosive and self-cleaning ability. Herein, a novel titania nanostructured mesh membrane with superamphiphilicity in air, and dual superlyophobicity in liquid mediums were fabricated, Both high separation efficiency and flux of more than 99.2% and 16,954 L m(-2)h(-1) were obtained for both light and heavy oil/water mixtures. Importantly, the TiO2 mesh membrane showed mechanically robust nanostructures and anti-corrosive ability, which can remain dual superlyophobicity, i.e., both underwater superoleophobicity and underoil superhydrophobicity and high oil-water separating behavior even after immersion in solutions of strong acid, basic, high salty, various organic solvents, and even after being abrased and adhered by pure sands and adhesive tape, respectively. Meanwhile, TiO2 mesh membrane had shown photocatalytic decomposition of oil and organic molecules under UV irradiation, demonstrating unique self-cleaning and anti-fouling ability of the membranes. Given so many merits of these unique membranes, it is believed to these membranes have great potentials to be used in wastewater treatment and oil spill recovery.

AB Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSP) have attracted extensive research interest due to their potential medical application. Herein, infrared-assisted technique is employed for the first time to extract BSP from B. striata (Thunb.) Reichb.f. based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology, with the optimum extraction parameters as follows: 75 degrees C extraction temperature, 2.5 h extraction time; and water to solid ratio (53 ml/g). Based on it, 43.95 +/- 0.26% yield of crude BSP was obtained. Subsequently, crude BSP was further decolorized, deproteinized, freeze-dried, and purified by a DEAE-52 cellulose column. Furthermore, the micro-structure and a triple-helical structure of BSP were characterized. Fourier transform infrared spectra confirmed its polysaccharide characterization via typical peaks. In addition, the significant in vitro antioxidant profiles of BSP were demonstrated by superoxide anion radical-scavenging assay, hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, DPPH free radical scavenging activity and chelation of ferrous ions. Taken together, this study provide an efficient extraction technique for BSP as a promising natural antioxidant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organic dye in water is a crucial global environmental problem. Notably, dyes, especially anionic dye Congo red (CR) and cationic dye Methylene blue (MB), have carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on human health. However, the commercial activated carbon with bad reusability is difficult to collect, which results in poor actual adsorption. In this paper, ZIF-67@wood obtained by in situ growth of ZIF-67 on wood is carbonized to prepare magnetic WC-Co composites. The hierarchical porous structure of wood can facilitate the rapid passage of dye solution, and promote full contact between magnetic core-shell Co/C nanoparticles and dyes. The adsorption capacities of CR and MB by Co/C-1000 are 1117.03 and 805.08 mg g(-1), respectively. The pH(pzc) (7.9) of Co/C-1000 is then determined. When the dye concentration reaches 1200 mg L-1, the removal efficiency of Co/C-1000 reaches 99.98% under gravity. With the flux of 1.0 x 10(4) L m(-2)h(-1) for CR solution (100 mg L-1), the removal efficiency of Co/C-1000 filter connected with peristaltic pump is almost 99.28%. In addition, the Co/C-1000 filter with high reusability and the adsorbed dyes can be removed by simple burning. This economical, recyclable and self-supporting filter with ultra-high adsorption capacity feature has the potential to replace commercial activated carbon and it will be widely used in practical wastewater treatment.

AB Diabetic wound management still faces great challenges mainly due to immune disorders at wound area. Especially, macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype is severely inhibited at the inflammatory stage. Thus, targeted regulation of macrophage polarization could be a useful approach to normalize the immune environment of diabetic wound to accelerate wound healing. Herein, a composited hydrogel derived from natural polymers, as an immunoregulatory dressing, was fabricated to treat diabetic wound. The composited hydrogel (GBTF) was synthesized by one step photo-polymerization of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), Bletilla Striata polysaccharide (BSP) and tannic acid/ferric iron complex (TA/Fe3+). Attributed to the chemical and physical cross-linking, the GBTF hydrogel exhibited adequate mechanical properties. Thanks to the photothermal transition of TA/Fe3+ in GBTF, good antibacterial capacity was achieved. Meanwhile, the polyphenol in TA could help to attenuate excessive ROS and induce macrophage polarization toward M2 phenotype. Furthermore, the potential immunoregulatory mechanism of the GBTF hydrogel was investigated through RNA sequencing in vitro. In addition, BSP showed positive contribution in vascularization. In vivo, results from diabetic wound model showed that the wound treated by GBTF hydrogel presented the fastest closure rate, superior granulation tissue regeneration, re-epithelialization and collagen deposition. These results indicated GBTF hydrogel rapidly promoted wound healing through anti-inflammation and pro-angiogenesis. The GBTF hydrogel showed great potential to serve as promising dressing for treatment of diabetic wounds in clinic.

AB The self-healing hydrogels are extremely attractive in biological and biomedical fields. The imine bond obtained by the Schiff base reaction is a commonly used dynamic covalent bond to fabricate self-healing hydrogels. Gelatin is a commonly used natural macromolecule in the biomedical field with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nonimmunogenicity. However, the gelatin-based hydrogels with self-healing ability are rarely reported based on imine bonds. Herein, we present a facile approach to fabricate a gelatin hydrogel with self-healing ability based on the Schiff base reaction. The gelatin was first reacted with ethylenediamine to increase the content of amino groups. Then dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose was used to cross-link amino-gelatin to fabricate the self-healing hydrogel. The results showed that the fabricated hydrogel exhibited good self-healing ability as expected because of the formed dynamic imine bonds between amino-gelatin and dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose. The hydrogel also presented good fatigue resistance and self-recovery capacity. Moreover, the self-healing hydrogel possessed ideal hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility. In sum, the fabricated self-healing hydrogel has application prospects in biomedical fields, such as injectable cell and drug carrier and injectable tissue engineering scaffold.

AB It has been well established by field experiments that warming stimulates either net ecosystem carbon uptake or release, leading to negative or positive carbon cycle-climate change feedback, respectively. This variation in carbon-climate feedback has been partially attributed to water availability. However, it remains unclear under what conditions water availability enhances or weakens carbon-climate feedback or even changes its direction. Combining a field experiment with a global synthesis, we show that warming stimulates net carbon uptake (negative feedback) under wet conditions, but depresses it (positive feedback) under very dry conditions. This switch in carbon-climate feedback direction arises mainly from scaling effects of warming-induced decreases in soil water content on net ecosystem productivity. This water scaling of warming effects offers generalizable mechanisms not only to help explain varying magnitudes and directions of observed carbon-climate feedback but also to improve model prediction of ecosystem carbon dynamics in response to climate change.

AB This paper proposes an optimized tracking control approach using neural network (NN) based reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of nonlinear dynamic systems, which requires both tracking and optimizing to be performed simultaneously. Generally, for obtaining optimal control solution, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is expected to be solvable, but, owing to strong nonlinearity, the equation is solved difficultly or even impossibly by analytical methods. Therefore, adaptive NN approximation based RL is usually considered. In the optimized control design, for driving output state following to the desired trajectory, an error term is split from optimal performance index function, and then both actor and critic NNs are built to perform RL algorithm. Actor NN aims to execute control behaviors, and critic NN aims to appraise control performance and make feedback to actor. The proof of stability concludes that the desired control performances are obtained. A numerical simulation is designed and implemented, and the desired results are shown.

AB Natural resource consumption and the digital economy are increasingly critical in empowering industrial green transformation, which is also an ongoing and valuable topic worth exploring. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of natural resource use and the digital economy on industrial green transformation in 30 Chinese provincial-level administrative data from 2006 to 2020. The outcomes reveal that digital economy can significantly drive industrial green transformation by elevating natural resource consumption. Significant heterogeneity is observed in the effects of natural resource use and digital economy on industrial green transformation. Manifestly, the digital economy stimulates industrial green transformation by promoting natural resource use in the east-central regions of China, while the mechanism is insignificant in the western region of China. Finally, the positive impact of natural resource use on industrial green transformation is gradually strengthening with the continuous increase in the digital economy level. Our findings imply that policymakers should differentiate the execution of digital economy policies and build an empowered natural resource usage system led by the digital economy to accelerate industrial green transformation.

AB Conservation agriculture through the use of crop residue retention and no-tillage (NT) has been widely practiced to improve agricultural soil quality, such as to increase soil organic carbon (C) content and the microbial population size. However, there has been no quantitative analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (C-mic) and nitrogen (N-mic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC, C-mic-to-organicC ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture practices on soil C-mic, N-mic and qMIC on a global scale using meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue retention (NTRO) increased C-mic by 33% (P < 0.05), while NT with residue retention (NTR) increased (P < 0.05) C-mic, N-mic and qMIC by 25, 64, and 57%, respectively. Greater C-mic and N-mic were found in the NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g., soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising conservation agriculture practice to increase C-mic and N-mic in global farmlands, and NTRO can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the subhumid (600-1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under long-term (> 20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase C-mic and N-mic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands.

AB The biological nitrogen input is essential for nutrient enrichment in natural grassland ecosystems. This process is carried out by diazotrophic microbes. However, the patterns and assembly processes of diazotrophic communities in grassland soil are not fully understood, especially in alpine meadows of high-altitude Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). In this study, the diversity patterns and community assembly processes of soil diazotrophic communities were investigated in QTP alpine meadows. The results showed that different diazotrophic taxa responded differentially to the increase of soil pH, and alpha-diversity increased linearly with pH values. Diazotrophic community turnover was enhanced by the increased variation in soil pH, moreover, it also showed strong response to mean annual temperature. Null model analysis showed that deterministic processes were most important in shaping the phylogenetic community structure and assembly of diazotrophs. Diazotrophic communities of each sampling site tended to be phylogenetically clustered, while communities at high pH soils (pH 7.00 to 8.00) showed more clustering than those of low pH (pH 5.02 to 7.00). The soil pH is a main driver in structuring soil diazotrophic community assembly by regulating the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in QTP alpine meadows.

AB NiFe2O4/polypyrrole (NiFe2O4/PPy) nanocomposites are prepared by a simple surface-initiated polymerization method and demonstrate negative permittivity in the low frequency regions. These nanocomposites also exhibit significantly enhanced electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption property in the high frequency regions. Compared with pure PPy, the enhanced negative permittivity is observed in the NiFe2O4/PPy nanocomposites with a NiFe2O4 loading of 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 and 40.0 wt%, indicating the formation of metal-like electrical conducting network in NiFe2O4/PPy nanocomposites. Moreover, the negative permittivity could be tuned by changing the NiFe2O4 loading. The minimum reflection loss (RL) of -40.8 dB is observed in the 40.0 wt% NiFe2O4/PPy composites with a thickness of only 1.9 mm. The effective absorption bandwidth below -10.0 and -20.0 dB reaches 6.08 and 2.08 GHz, respectively. The enhanced EMW absorption performance benefits from the improved independence matching, EMW attenuation capacity, and synergistic effects of conduction loss, dielectric loss (interfacial and dipole polarizations) and magnetic loss (exchange and natural resonances). This research work provides a guidance for the fabrication of nanocomposites with an excellent EMW absorption.

AB The search of multifunctional epoxy nanocomposites with both strength and toughness combined with smart features such as electrical conductivity is essential in design of advanced materials. In this work, by utilizing a binary nanofiller strategy, both strength and toughness as well as high electrical conductivity are obtained in epoxy with trace nanopolystyrene grafted with epichlorohydrin (nano g-PS) to facilitate the dispersion of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The increased tensile strength (37.6%) and flexural strength (34.4%) are acquired in nano g-PS (0.0677 vol%)/MWCNTs (0.0335 vol%)/epoxy in contrast to pure epoxy. A remarkably improved tensile toughness up to 379.2% and an increased elongation at break up to 208.3% are obtained in this epoxy nanohybrid. The synergistic interactions among nano g-PS, MWCNTs and epoxy matrix as well as the state transition of nano g-PS from glassy state to fluid state provide an improved dispersion of nanofillers which is responsible for the increased electrical conductivity and enhanced mechanical properties. The decreased surface resistivity allows these nanohybrids to sufficiently dissipate surface charges as an antistatic material. This work provides an effective way to disperse carbon nanotubes with small amount of thermoplastic PS to simultaneously strengthen and toughen the thermosetting epoxy while introducing highly conductive function.

AB Gelatin-based composite hydrogel fibers were prepared by gel-spinning with PEG6000 as the modifier. Dialdehyde carboxymethyl cellulose (DCMC), as an ideal crosslinking reagent for protein, was used to fix the composite hydrogel fibers. Then the biological properties of the hydrogel fibers for wound dressings were evaluated. The results indicate that the hydrogen bond interactions and C=N linkages between gelatin and DCMC can be formed. The addition of DCMC can efficiently improve the mechanical properties, enzymatic stability and blood compatibility of the hydrogel fibers. Crosslinking with DCMC can reduce the degree of swelling of the hydrogel fibers, which is beneficial for hydrogel fibers to avoid undesired reduction in mechanical properties. Moreover, the composite hydrogel fibers present three-dimensional structure, porous networks and low cytotoxicity. The study suggests that DCMC is an effective crosslinking reagent for biomaterials fixation. The developed composite hydrogel fibers can be well-suited for biomedical applications such as wound dressings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The measurement scales, consistency index, inconsistency issues, missing judgment estimation and priority derivation methods have been extensively studied in the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). Various approaches have been proposed to handle these problems, and made great contributions to the decision making. This paper reviews the literature of the main developments of the PCM. There are plenty of literature related to these issues, thus we mainly focus on the literature published in 37 peer reviewed international journals from 2010 to 2015 (searched via ISI Web of science). We attempt to analyze and classify these literatures so as to find the current hot research topics and research techniques in the PCM, and point out the future directions on the PCM. It is hoped that this paper will provide a comprehensive literature review on PCM, and act as informative summary of the main developments of the PCM for the researchers for their future research.

AB There is an urgent need for cost-effective strategies to produce hydrogen from renewable net-zero carbon sources using renewable energies. In this context, the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction can be boosted by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the oxidation of small organic molecules, such as ethylene glycol (EG). EG is a particularly interesting organic liquid with two hydroxyl groups that can be transformed into a variety of C1 and C2 chemicals, depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions. Here, a catalyst is demonstrated for the selective EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) to formate on nickel selenide. The catalyst nanoparticle (NP) morphology and crystallographic phase are tuned to maximize its performance. The optimized NiS electrocatalyst requires just 1.395 V to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 1 m potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 1 m EG. A combination of in situ electrochemical infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) to monitor the electrocatalytic process and ex situ analysis of the electrolyte composition shows the main EGOR product is formate, with a Faradaic efficiency above 80%. Additionally, C2 chemicals such as glycolate and oxalate are detected and quantified as minor products. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the reaction process show the glycol-to-oxalate pathway to be favored via the glycolate formation, where the C-C bond is broken and further electro-oxidized to formate.

AB Beyond conventional hybrid ion capacitors (HICs) based on porous carbon capacitive materials, the introduction of faradaic pseudocapacitance in HICs is an effective method to enhance energy density. Herein, we prepare methylene blue functionalized graphene (MB-X) composites taking advantage of electrostatic and extensive pi-conjugated interaction. The test results confirm that the composites have high rate capability and excellent cycle stability on account of the synergistic effect between graphene and MB molecules. In order to improve the safety of HICs, an aqueous electrolyte is a promising candidate as long as the cell voltage can be efficiently increased. Therefore, we skillfully employ aqueous solutions with different pH values as asymmetric electrolytes to assemble HICs, where polyimide acts as the battery material and MB-X serves as the capacitive material. Thanks to the asymmetric electrolytes, the constructed aqueous HICs can operate at a cell voltage of 1.9 V, much larger than the decomposition voltage of water. Moreover, the flexible structure, and reversible and fast redox reactions of both the anode and cathode make the aqueous HICs display a maximum energy density of 48.6 W h kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 19 kW kg(-1), as well as a long-cycle lifetime with a decay of 0.00172% per cycle.

AB Objective: Internet addiction is one of the most common problems among adolescents and effective treatment is needed. This research aims to test the effectiveness and underlying mechanism of multi-family group therapy (MFGT) to reduce Internet addiction among adolescents.
   Method: A total of 92 participants consisting of 46 adolescents with Internet addiction, aged 12-18 years, and 46 their parents, aged 35-46 years, were assigned to the experimental group (six-session MFGT intervention) or a waiting-list control. Structured questionnaires were administered at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2) and a three-month follow-up (T3).
   Results: There was a significant difference in the decline both in the average score and proportion of adolescents with Internet addiction in MFGT group at post-intervention (M-T1 = 3.40, M-T2 = 2.46, p < 0.001; 100 versus 4.8%, p < 0.001) maintained for three months (M-T3 = 2.06, p < 0.001; 100 versus 11.1%, p < 0.001). Reports from both adolescents and parents were significantly better than those in the control group. Further explorations of the underlying mechanisms of effectiveness based on the changed values of measured variables showed that the improvement in adolescent Internet use was partially explained by the satisfaction of their psychological needs and improved parent-adolescent communication and closeness.
   Conclusions: The six-session multi-family group therapy was effective in reducing Internet addiction behaviors among adolescents and could be implemented as part of routine primary care clinic services in similar populations. As family support system is critical in maintaining the intervention effect, fostering positive parent-adolescent interaction and addressing adolescents' psychological needs should be included in preventive programs for Internet addiction in the future.

AB The agaric-like anodes of porous carbon decorated with MoO2 nanoparticles (MoO2/C) for reversible Li/Na storage were synthesized via a green and facile bio-inspired route. The uniformly distributed MoO2 nanoparticles, the porous agaric-like carbon matrix and high degree graphitization of carbon materials, effectively mitigated the huge volume changes during cycling and improved the reversible capacity, resulting in the outstanding electrochemical behaviors with excellent rate capability, high capacity and excellent stable long cycling lifespan as anodes for lithium and sodium storage. Especially, the MoO2/C electrodes showed ultralong cycling performance under high current density of 5.0 A g(-1), presenting a reversible capacity of 363.2 mAh g(-1) after a prolonged 2000-cycles as anodes for Li storage. Meanwhile, the MoO2/C electrodes displayed a super-long cycling lifespan of 3000 cycles with the reversible discharge capacity of 193.5 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 5.0 A g(-1) for Na storage. Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of MoO2/C-4 electrodes as anodes for Li/Na storage was carried out to further investigate the electrochemical behavior. The ultralong cycling performance under high-density could satisfy the demands of next-generation anode electrodes for Li/Na ion batteries, promoting the commercialization process of MoO2-based materials.

AB Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) holds great promise for deep tissue visualization. Development of novel clinical translatable NIR-II probes is crucial for realizing the medical applications of NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Herein, the glutathione-capped gold nanoclusters (AuNCs, specifically Au-25(SG)(18)) demonstrate highly efficient binding capability to hydroxyapatite in vitro for the first time. Further in vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging of AuNCs indicate that they accumulate in bone tissues with high contrast and signal-background ratio. AuNCs are also mainly and quickly excreted from body through renal system, showing excellent ribs and thoracic vertebra imaging because of no background signal in liver and spleen. The deep tissue penetration capability and high resolution of AuNCs in NIR-II imaging render their great potential for fluorescence-guided surgery like spinal pedicle screw implantation. Overall, AuNCs are highly promising and clinical translatable NIR-II imaging probe for visualizing bone and bone related abnormalities.

TI Time Series Prediction Based on LSTM-Attention-LSTM Model
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Time series forecasting; long short-term memory networks; encoder and
   decoder model; attention mechanisms
AB Time series forecasting uses data from the past periods of time to predict future information, which is of great significance in many applications. Existing time series forecasting methods still have problems such as low accuracy when dealing with some non-stationary multivariate time series data forecasting. Aiming at the shortcomings of existing methods, in this paper we propose a new time series forecasting model LSTM-attention-LSTM. The model uses two LSTM models as the encoder and decoder, and introduces an attention mechanism between the encoder and decoder. The model has two distinctive features: first, by using the attention mechanism to calculate the interrelationship between sequence data, it overcomes the disadvantage of the coder-and-decoder model in that the decoder cannot obtain sufficiently long input sequences; second, it is suitable for sequence forecasting with long time steps. In this paper we validate the proposed model based on several real data sets, and the results show that the LSTM-attention-LSTM model is more accurate than some currently dominant models in prediction. The experiment also assessed the effect of the attention mechanism at different time steps by varying the time step.

AB Although gray matter (GM) damages caused by long term and excessive alcohol consumption have long been reported, the structural neuroimaging findings on alcohol-use disorders (AUD) are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis, using a novel voxel-based meta-analytic method effect size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM), to characterize GM changes in AUD patients. Twelve studies including 433 AUD patients and 498 healthy controls (HCs) were retrieved. The AUD group demonstrated significant GM reductions in the corticostriatal-limbic circuits, including bilateral insula, superior temporal gyrus, striatum, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left thalamus and right hippocampus compared to HCs. GM reduction in the right striatum is significantly negatively related to duration of alcohol dependence, while GM shrinkage of the left superior, middle frontal gyrus, and left thalamus is related to lifetime alcohol consumption. The findings demonstrate that the GM abnormalities caused by AUD are in corticostriatal-limbic circuits whose dysfunctions may involve in craving and observed functional deficits.

Numerous multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have been proposed to handle the measurement of the priorities of conflicting tangible/intangible criteria and in turn use them to choose the best alternative for a decision. However, the presence of many MCDM methods bewilders users. The existence of these methods becomes a decision problem in itself, and decision makers may be uncertain about which one to use. Thus the comparative analysis and evaluation of various MCDM methods has come under scrutiny by both researchers and practitioners in order to discover if there are logical, mathematical, social or practical reasons why one method is better than another. Criteria for their evaluation are the first important issue that needs to be resolved. In this paper, 16 criteria are introduced that may be used to judge and evaluate various MCDM methods. The criteria proposed and some guidelines for their evaluation are given to help readers evaluate these MCDM methods.

AB Carbon mitigation in the urban residential building sector is critical for China to achieve its carbon peak and carbon neutral commitment. However, how urbanization affects urban residential building carbon emissions is still unclear. This study adopts the panel threshold regression model to explore the dynamic influence mechanism of the urbanization on urban residential building CO2 emissions based on the evidence from China's 30 provincial regions during 2000-2015. Results indicate that urbanization contributes positively to the increase of urban residential building CO2 emissions, while such degree of influence varies across different stages of income and energy structure. As for per capita income, the promoting effect of the urbanization on urban residential building CO2 emissions is enhanced with the growth of per capita income. And the degree of such increasing effect becomes greater when per capita income exceeds its threshold value. Regarding the energy mix, the driving effect of urbanization on urban residential building CO2 emissions is also strengthened when the energy mix crosses its threshold value, showing a "stepwise growth" feature. This study reveals the nonlinear influence mechanism of urbanization on urban building CO2 emissions, and this is helpful in boosting the related theoretical and practical exploration on the impact of urbanization on the environment. Based on our findings, an environmentally-friendly consumption pattern should be promoted and more penetration of deaner energies should be improved in urban households, which will be effective to alleviate the increase of residential carbon emissions.

AB Carbon fiber composite laminates were interfacially reinforced through in-situ synthesis of g-C3N4 on the carbon fibers. The introduced g-C3N4 greatly improved the roughness, functional groups and wettability on the carbon fiber surface and markedly enhanced the interfacial properties of composite laminates. The surface free energy of carbon fibers was increased by 67.81%. Interlaminar shear strength and interfacial shear strength of composite laminates were increased from 51.84 to 72.09 MPa and 44.62-73.41 MPa, respectively. The significantly enhanced interfacial properties enabled the mechanical performance of composite laminates to reach a superior state. Tensile strength and bending strength were increased by 19.54 and 10.51%, respectively. The total absorbed energy of impact experiment was also enhanced from 1.14 to 1.78 J. Meanwhile, dynamic mechanical properties and hydrothermal aging resistance were also ameliorated significantly. The improved interfacial properties and mechanical properties were ascribed to the increased mechanical interlocking, enhanced chemical bonding and ameliorated wettability created by g-C3N4.

AB Soil represents the largest phosphorus (P) stock in terrestrial ecosystems. Determining the amount of soil P is a critical first step in identifying sites where ecosystem functioning is potentially limited by soil P availability. However, global patterns and predictors of soil total P concentration remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we constructed a database of total P concentration of 5275 globally distributed (semi-)natural soils from 761 published studies. We quantified the relative importance of 13 soil-forming variables in predicting soil total P concentration and then made further predictions at the global scale using a random forest approach. Soil total P concentration varied significantly among parent material types, soil orders, biomes, and continents and ranged widely from 1.4 to 9630.0 (median 430.0 and mean 570.0) mg kg(-1) across the globe. About two-thirds (65 %) of the global variation was accounted for by the 13 variables that we selected, among which soil organic carbon concentration, parent material, mean annual temperature, and soil sand content were the most important ones. While predicted soil total P concentrations increased significantly with latitude, they varied largely among regions with similar latitudes due to regional differences in parent material, topography, and/or climate conditions. Soil P stocks (excluding Antarctica) were estimated to be 26.8 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- standard deviation) Pg and 62.2 +/- 8.9 Pg (1 Pg =1 x 10(15) g) in the topsoil (0-30 cm) and subsoil (30-100 cm), respectively. Our global map of soil total P concentration as well as the underlying drivers of soil total P concentration can be used to constraint Earth system models that represent the P cycle and to inform quantification of global soil P availability. Raw datasets and global maps generated in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14583375 (He et al., 2021).

AB Numerous carbon networks materials comprised of benzene moieties, such as graphene and fullerene, have held great fascination for radioprotection because of their acknowledged good biocompatibility and strong free radical scavenging activity derived from their delocalized pi-conjugated structure. Recently, graphdiyne, a new emerging carbon network material consisting of a unique chemical structure of benzene and acetylenic moieties, has gradually attracted attention in many research fields. Encouraged by its unique structure with strong conjugated pi-system and highly reactive diacetylenic linkages, graphdiyne might have free radical activity and can thus be used as a radioprotector, which has not been investigated so far. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized bovine serum albumin (BSA)-modified graphdiyne nanoparticles (graphdiyne-BSA NPs) to evaluate their free radical scavenging ability and investigate their application for radioprotection both in cell and animal models. In vitro studies indicated that the graphdiyne-BSA NPs could effectively eliminate the free-radicals, decrease radiation-induced DNA damage in cells, and improve the viability of cells under ionizing radiation. In vivo experiments showed that the graphdiyne-BSA NPs could protect the bone marrow DNA of mice from radiation-induced damage and make the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (two kinds of vital indicators of radiation-induced injury) recover back to normal levels. Furthermore, the good biocompatibility and negligible systemically toxicity responses of the graphdiyne-BSA NPs to mice were verified. All these results manifest the good biosafety and radioprotection activity of graphdiyne-BSA NPs to normal tissues. Therefore, our studies not only provide a new radiation protection platform based on graphdiyne for protecting normal tissues from radiation-caused injury but also provide a promising direction for the application of graphdiyne in the biomedicine field.

AB The dimension of polyaniline (PANI) is effectively tuned by changing the end groups of additive surfactants. PANI fiberboards, dendrites, and rods are separately obtained through the guidance of micelle soft templates formed by the corresponding surfactants, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), sodium lauryl sulfonate (SLS), and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that PANI structures are fabricated from a bottom-up self-assembly process where one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are aggregated into higher order architectures. Electrochemical properties of these PANI nanostructures are examined in details, and exhibit morphological dependence. The PANI rods having high specific surface area and rough surface favor more ions enter into their body contact with active sites. As a consequence, they have higher specific capacitance (192 F g(-1)) than fiberboards (55 F g(-1)) and dendrites (64 F g(-1)) at 3.0 A g(-1). Varying the substituent of additive molecules is in a position to alter the dimension of PANI that plays a decisive role in resulting electrochemical performances. This strategy may control the dimension and the properties of other conducting polymers for future applications.

AB This paper investigates the constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) source localization problem by using time difference of arrival and frequency difference of arrival measurements. The problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming with two indefinite quadratic equality constraints, which is nonconvex and NP-hard. Moreover, the weighting matrix is coupled with the unknown source position and velocity. We propose an iterative CWLS method that can efficiently solve this problem. It iteratively performs a linearization procedure on the quadratic equality constraints to obtain an approximate programming with linear constraints, which can be analytically solved, and the weighting matrix is updated in each iteration. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed method, if converges, can lead to the global optimal solution of the formulated problem that reaches the CRLB accuracy under mild assumptions on the measurement noises. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the percentage of convergence within 20 iterations is more than 96%, and the localization accuracy is significantly improved over the previous methods with less computation time requirement. Moreover, it is found from simulations that the iterative CWLS method retains acceptable performance even under the ill-conditioned situation when the sensor geometry is not desirable.

AB Next generation tissue-engineered skin scaffolds promise to provide sensory restoration through electrical stimulation in addition to effectively rebuilding and repairing skin. The integration of real-time monitoring of the injury motion activities can fundamentally improve the therapeutic efficacy by providing detailed data to guide the clinical practice. Herein, a mechanically-flexible, electroactive, and self-healable hydrogels (MESGel) was engineered for the combinational function of electrically-stimulated accelerated wound healing and motion sensing. MESGel shows outstanding biocompatibility and multifunctional therapeutic properties including flexibility, self-healing characteristics, biodegradability, and bioelectroactivity. Moreover, MESGel shows its potential of being a novel flexible electronic skin sensor to record the injury motion activities. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that MESGel can facilitate effective electrical stimulation, actively promoting proliferation in Chinese hamster lung epithelial cells and therefore can accelerate favorable epithelial biology during skin wound healing, demonstrating an effective therapeutic strategy for a full-thickness skin defect model and leading to new-type flexible bioelectronics.

AB A methanol economy will be favored by the availability of low-cost catalysts able to selectively oxidize methanol to formate. This selective oxidation would allow extraction of the largest part of the fuel energy while concurrently producing a chemical with even higher commercial value than the fuel itself. Herein, we present a highly active methanol electrooxidation catalyst based on abundant elements and with an optimized structure to simultaneously maximize interaction with the electrolyte and mobility of charge carriers. In situ infrared spectroscopy combined with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that branched nickel carbide particles are the first catalyst determined to have nearly 100 % electrochemical conversion of methanol to formate without generating detectable CO(2)as a byproduct. Electrochemical kinetics analysis revealed the optimized reaction conditions and the electrode delivered excellent activities. This work provides a straightforward and cost-efficient way for the conversion of organic small molecules and the first direct evidence of a selective formate reaction pathway.

AB Neuromorphic photonics system based on the principle of biological brain is emerging as one of the potential solutions to the bottleneck inherent in classical von Neumann computing system. Optoelectronic synaptic devices, used to mimic the visual function of bio-synapse by adapting synaptic weights, can construct a highly efficient brain-inspired computing system, in which the nanostructured materials and device architectures are attracting extensive interests, giving many potential benefits in confined light-matter interaction, fast carrier dynamics, and photocarriers trapping. Moreover, the conjunction of traditional nanostructured photodetectors and newly realized electronic synapses also exhibit appealing performance for many practical applications including information processing and computing. This review focuses and summarizes on recent achievement in developing advanced optoelectronic synaptic devices based on nanostructured materials as 0D (quantum dots), 1D, and 2D materials, as well as, the rapidly evolving hybrid heterostructures. In addition, challenges and promising prospects in this research field are also discussed.

AB This study sought to validate the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S), an instrument that measures perseverance and passion for long-term goals, among Chinese high school students. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the scale retains the two-factor structure of the original scale. The scale demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Evidence for construct validity was found in relation to the Big Five personality traits, self-control, and IQ. Evidence for criterion validity was found via the observation that grit explained unique variance in academic performance. Together, the Grit-S is a sound measure of grit among Chinese adolescents.

AB Electrocatalysis of ethylene glycol oxidation (EGO) on shape-controlled Pd nanocrystals is of great interest in the pursuit of efficient biomass fuel utilization and nanomaterial application. The present work is aimed at a mechanistic study of electrocatalytic EGO in alkaline media on surface-cleaned high-index Pd concave nanocubes (Pd CNCs) with and without surface Bi modification. CO -adsorption displacement effectively removes the surfactants on as -synthesized Pd CNCs, facilitating controlled Bi adatom formation. EGO on the Pd CNCs is notably enhanced as a result of Bi modification, with the activity peak at a Bi coverage of ca. 0.31 in terms of apparent and specific oxidation current densities. Internal (ATR-SEIRAS) and external (IRRAS) reflection modes of in situ infrared spectroscopy have been used to probe the EGO process at a molecular level. High surface sensitivity ATR-SEIRAS enabled ready identification of the formation and removal of CO and 2-hydroxyacetyl surface species during EGO on Pd CNCs and Bi-modified Pd (Bi/Pd) CNCs. In comparison to that on bare Pd CNCs, the CO,(ad) band is significantly stronger on Bi/Pd CNCs, suggestive of a promoted C- C bond cleavage. IRRAS results further reveal that glycolate and glyoxal are the main products of EGO on both pristine and Bi/Pd CNCs. In addition, formations of glyoxal, CO, and CO2 on Bi/Pd CNCs are relatively enhanced, in comparison to those on bare Pd CNCs. On the basis of the comprehensive spectral results and literature reports, relevant reaction pathways are proposed for EGO at Pd and Bi/Pd CNCs in alkaline media.

AB Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are known for their unique optical properties. In recent years, carbon nanomaterials of surface and/or structural defects have been found to exhibit similar properties after functionalization in various schemes. Among these carbon-based QDs are carbon dots, which are generally defined as small carbon nanoparticles with surface passivation. In fact, carbon dots now represent a rapidly advancing and expanding research field. As measured by the optical properties of carbon dots, the most effective passivation has been the surface functionalization of carbon nanoparticles with organic or polymeric molecules, corresponding to much brighter fluorescence emissions across the visible spectrum and extending into the near-IR. Therefore, carbon dots have been pursued extensively for potential bioimaging and other biomedical applications. The mechanistic framework for carbon dots includes photoinduced redox processes, similar to those found in conventional semiconductor QDs. As a result, carbon dots have also been pursued for their photocatalytic functions. In this article on surface-functionalized carbon nanoparticles or carbon dots, their representative syntheses and demonstrated properties and their potential uses as high-performance yet nontoxic fluorescence probes for bioimaging in vitro and in vivo are highlighted, so is their serving as potent photocatalysts in energy conversion applications.

AB Inspired by the molecular mechanics of mussel adhesive formation, a novel water-soluble fluorescent macromolecule (polydopamine-polyethyleneimine (PDA-PEI)) is prepared by one-pot copolymerization of dopamine (DA) and PEI. In this method, DA is polymerized to form PDA, which is then coupled with PEI mainly through Michael addition. The fluorescence property of PDA-PEI is mainly attributed to the Michael addition of PEI on the 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) units of PDA, where PEI can form hydrogen bonds with oxidative products such as DHI and force the DHI units to twist out of plane, resulting in a decrease in the intra- and intermolecular coupling of PDA. In addition, the influence of various metal cations on the fluorescence of the PDA-PEI copolymer is investigated. This work may facilitate the development of new strategies for controlling the emission characteristics of PDA.

AB Electronic health record (EHR) has recorded the process of occurrence, development, and treatment of diseases. So it has high medical value. Owing to the private and sensitive nature of medical data for patients, the data sharing and privacy preservation are critical issues in EHR. Blockchain technology may be a promising solution for the problems above since it holds the features of decentralization and tamper resistance. In the paper, we propose a medical data sharing and protection scheme based on the hospital's private blockchain to improve the electronic health system of the hospital. Firstly, the scheme can satisfy various security properties such as decentralization, openness, and tamper resistance. A reliable mechanism is created for the doctors to store medical data or access the historical data of patients while meeting privacy preservation. Furthermore, a symptoms-matching mechanism is given between patients. It allows patients who get the same symptoms to conduct mutual authentication and create a session key for their future communication about the illness. The proposed scheme is implemented by using PBC and OpenSSL libraries. Finally, the security and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is given.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles were adopted for the synthesis of magnetic graphene adsorbents, but the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles significantly reduced the adsorption capacity of graphene for antibiotics. In this study, we prepared magnetic graphene oxide sponge (MGOS) by lyophilizing the dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) for tetracycline adsorption. GO self assembled to form large sheets that built the large pores in MGOS. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were attached on GO sheets, enabling the magnetic property of MGOS. The adsorption capacity of MGOS for tetracycline was 473 mg/g, showing 50% increase comparing to GO. The adsorption was moderately fast and could be described by pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamics investigation indicated that the adsorption was endothermic and the driving force was entropy increase. The pH had mild influence on the adsorption, while ionic strength nearly had no impact. The implication to the applications of MGOS in antibiotics remediation is discussed.

AB This paper addresses the exponential synchronization issue of delayed chaotic neural networks (DCNNs) with control packet dropout. A novel stochastic switched sampled-data controller with time-varying sampling is developed in the frame of the zero-input strategy. First, by making full use of the available characteristics on the actual sampling pattern, a newly loop-delay-product-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LDPTLKF) is constructed via introducing a matrix-refined-function, which can reflect the information of delay variation. Second, based on the LDPTLKF and the relaxed Wirtinger-based integral inequality (RWBII), novel synchronization criteria are established to guarantee that DCNNs are synchronous exponentially when the control packet dropout occurs in a random way, which obeys certain Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences. Third, a desired sampled-data controller can be designed on account of the proposed optimization algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the obtained results are illustrated by two numerical examples with simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Piezo-potential promoted photocatalysis enables a scalable and high-efficiency dye decomposition by conju-gating the photoexcitation and mechanical stimulus. However, its catalytic efficiency is significantly restricted by the limited quantum yield and piezoelectric activity of catalysts. Herein, a heterogeneous CdS-Au composite photocatalyst was synthesized via a facile water bath heating and reflux condensation method for organic pol-lutants degradation. The synergism between piezo-phototronic effect and localized surface plasmon resonance facilitates photon-generated carrier separation and internal quantum efficiency. The loading of Au nanoparticles remarkably modulates the morphologies, surface defect, effective optronics utilization and photocatalytic ac-tivities of CdS nanospheres. A 2.3 folds enhancement in the photodegradation of Methyl Orange (MO) was observed with the optimal 4 mol% Au loading. Furthermore, the impact of frequency and intensity of ultra-sonication on the electrochemical impedance and photocatalytic activity was systematically investigated. This work offers a promising approach for harnessing noise or vibration for environmental remediation and opens up a new route for designing and developing high-performance piezo-photocatalyst.

AB This paper proposes a new hybrid-driven (HD) sampling control strategy to investigate the finite-time (FT) H-infinity synchronization issue for complex networks with stochastic cyber attacks (SCAB) and random memory information exchanges (RMIEs). The HD control scheme with random switching memory storage which is described by independent Bernoulli variables, is employed to alleviate the burden of the network. Different from the existing work, a novel memory interconnection Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is structured by taking full advantage of more information of sampling interval and state, and developing some new terms. Moreover, by utilizing the integral inequality treatment techniques together with stochastic analysis methods, several optimized control algorithms (OCAS) with a larger sampling period (LSP) are established for analyzing the FT synchronization issue of homologous error system with the optimal performance index. Then, the desired controllers can be synthesized by resorting to some matrix inequalities. Finally, the chua's circuit model is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed strategies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collagen is a favorable candidate in the field of biomaterials as a wound dressing. However, it cannot be ignored that the application of collagen is limited to its poor physicochemical and perishable properties. It is significant to endow collagen with antibacterial activity and simultaneously improve its physicochemical properties. Here, we present a simple method to fabricate antibacterial collagen-based wound dressing with appropriate physicochemical properties. First, dialdehyde xanthan gum (DXG) was used as an environmentally friendly reducing agent and stabilizer to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Then, collagen/DXG-AgNP composite dressings were fabricated by directly immersing a collagen sponge in the obtained DXG-AgNP aqueous solutions. Our results showed that the spherical AgNPs with diameters of 12-35 nm were successfully synthesized. The presence of DXG effectively prevented aggregation and precipitation of AgNPs in aqueous solution. By the simple one-step solution-immersion approach, AgNPs were homogeneously introduced into the collagen matrix and collagen was simultaneously cross-linked by the existent DXG. Robust antibacterial activity was endowed to collagen as expected while the physicochemical properties of collagen were effectively improved. It is interesting that collagen/DXG-AgNP composite dressings possessed the properties of shape memory, good blood compatibility, and cytocompatibility. In addition, collagen/DXG-AgNP composite dressings could accelerate the deposition of collagen and thereby effectively promote full-thickness burn healing without scar formation.

AB It is significant to develop new approaches to incorporate naturally active agents into gelatin-based edible films for effective antioxidant and long-term antibacterial activities. Here the naturally active compound rosmarinic acid (RosA) was firstly conjugated onto gelatin backbone via EDC/NHS chemistry. Then the conjugates were plasticized by glycerol and crosslinked by dialdehyde xanthan gum to fabricate active RosA-gelatin edible films. The results indicate that the RosA-gelatin edible films present good water resistance property, strong mechanical property and excellent ultraviolet light barrier ability. The conjugation of RosA confers gelatin-based edible films with effective antioxidant and antibacterial activities as expected. It is interesting that RosA-gelatin edible films after 3 months of storage still show good antibacterial activity as that of newly prepared ones, demonstrating the long-term antibacterial activity. Overall, the fabricated RosA-gelatin edible films may have promising application in the fields of food and pharmaceutical packaging.

AB Due to the presence of pores and low density, a high recoverable energy density (W-rec) value is usually obtained at the cost of energy storage efficiency (eta) in lead-free potassium sodium niobate [(K, Na)NbO3, KNN] based ceramics, which also affects the hardness of ceramics, finally limiting the further development of practical applications. A high W-rec (similar to 3.60 J/cm(3)) and a high eta (similar to 74.2%) are obtained in 0.975K(0.5)Na(0.5)NbO(3)-0.025LaBiO(3) (0.975KNN-0.025LB) ceramics simultaneously under a high dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) of 340 kV/cm, together with a fast discharge rate (t(0.9) similar to 46 ns) and high power density (P-D similar to 49.4 MVV/cm(3)). Further analysis of the intrinsic electronic structure is carried out via the first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory (DFT). An ultrahigh hardness (H) of 6.63 GPa can be accordingly obtained. This work combines excellent energy storage properties and ultrahigh hardness, which provides significant guidelines for applications in pulsed-power systems.

AB Inflammation is a beneficial and physiological process, but there are a number of inflammatory diseases which have detrimental effects on the body. In addition, the drugs used to treat inflammation have toxic side effects when used over a long period of time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can be isolated from a variety of tissues and can be differentiate into diverse cell types under appropriate conditions. They also exhibit noteworthy anti-inflammatory properties, providing new options for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The therapeutic potential of MSCs is currently being investigated for various inflammatory diseases, such as kidney injury, lung injury, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSCs can perform multiple functions, including immunomodulation, homing, and differentiation, to enable damaged tissues to form a balanced inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment under severe inflammatory conditions. In addition, accumulated evidence indicates that exosomes from extracellular vesicles of MSCs (MSC-Exos) play an extraordinary role, mainly by transferring their components to recipient cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and clinical trials of MSCs and MSCExos in various inflammatory diseases in detail, with a view to contributing to the treatment of MSCs and MSC-Exos in inflammatory diseases.

AB This paper studies the stochastic exponential synchronization problem for uncertain chaotic neural networks (UCNNs) with probabilistic faults (PFs) and randomly occurring time-varying parameters uncertainties(ROTVPUs). To reflect more realistic control behaviors, a new stochastic reliable nonuniform sampling controller with Markov switching topologies is designed for the first time. First, by taking into full account more information on sawtooth structural sampling pattern, time delay and its variation, a novel loose-looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LLLKF) is developed via introducing matricesrefined-function and adjustable parameters. Second, with the aid of novel LLLKF and relaxed Wirtinger-based integral inequality (RWBII), new synchronization algorithms are established to guarantee that UCNNs are synchronous exponentially under probabilistic actuator and sensor faults. Third, based on the proposed optimization algorithm, the desired reliable sampled-data controller can be achieved under more larger exponential decay rate. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the designed algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Isolation of earth abundant biopolymer, Lignin, from Dendrocalamus sinicus and their structural properties were investigated to achieve its large-scale practical applications in value-added products. Two lignin fractions (MWL DSL) were isolated with successive treatments of dioxane and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) from dewaxed and ball milled bamboo (D. sinicus) sample. The two-step treatments yielded 52.1% lignin based on the total lignin content in the dewaxed bamboo sample. Spectroscopy analyses indicated that the isolated bamboo lignin was a typical grass lignin, consisting of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl units. The major interunit linkages presented in the obtained bamboo lignin were beta-O-4' aryl ether linkages, together with lower amounts of beta-beta', beta-5' and beta-1' linkages. The tricin was detected to be linked to lignin polymer through the beta-O-4' linkage in the bamboo. In addition, phenyl glycoside and benzyl ether lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC) linkages were clearly detected in bamboo (D. sinicus), whereas the gamma-ester LCC linkages were ambiguous due to the overlapping NMR signals with other substructures. The detailed structural properties of the obtained lignin fraction together with the light-weight will benefit efficient utilization of natural polymers as a possibly large-scale bio-based precursor for making polymeric materials, biochemicals, functional carbon and biofuels, and multifunctional polymer nanocomposites.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can provide safety and nonsafety applications to improve passenger safety and comfort. Grouping vehicles into platoons in VANETs can improve road safety and reduce fuel consumption. It is critical to design an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for platoon-based VANETs. Moreover, because of the space and time dynamics of moving vehicles, network connectivity is an important performance metric to indicate the quality of the network communications and the satisfaction of users. Unfortunately, network connectivity is often ignored in the design of existing MAC protocols for VANETs. In this paper, we study the connectivity characteristics and present a connectivity-aware MAC protocol for platoon-based VANETs. The connectivity probabilities are analyzed for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication scenarios in one-and two-way VANETs, respectively. A multipriority Markov model is presented to derive the relationship between connectivity probability and system throughput. Based on variable traffic status and network connectivity, a multi-channel reservation scheme is adopted to dynamically adjust the length of the control channel interval and the service channel interval for the improvement of the system throughput. Analysis and simulation results show that the throughput increases with connectivity probability. However, with a further increase in connectivity probability, the throughput will decrease due to numerous channel contentions.

AB The dysfunction of the circulatory system leads to various pathological processes with high morbidity. Recently, fluorescence imaging in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window (1000-1700 nm) has attracted immense attention in many biological processes. The rapid metabolism and low toxicity of some NIR-II organic small molecules indicate their feasibility for use in visualizing the circulatory system. However, most of the reported NIR-II organic small molecules presently encounter such dilemmas as complicated synthetic procedures and low quantum yields (QY). To address this challenge, a series of facilely prepared NIR-II organic small molecule CQ-T (CQ-1-4T) are designed and these compounds are loaded with biocompatible human serum albumin (HSA) to improve QY. Among them, CQL (CQ-4T/HSA) demonstrates superior optical properties and a 6.65-fold increase in fluorescence compared to the small molecule alone. Further work validates the efficacy and accuracy of CQL in monitoring the real-time circulatory system-related physiological and pathological processes in vivo, including thrombosis, peripheral arterial disease, tumor angiogenesis, and lymphatic drainage. Moreover, the excellent optical properties of CQL enable precise tumor resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy under NIR-II navigation. In conclusion, CQL is a novel and promising NIR-II organic probe with multifunctional imaging capability. It is highly desirable to accelerate its future translations into the clinic.

AB In-situ synthesis of C3N4 on the carbon fiber surface was reported for enhancing interfacial properties of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin composite. The formed C3N4 on the carbon fiber surface can greatly increase the roughness, polar functional groups and wettability of carbon fiber surface, thereby leading to significant enhancement of interfacial properties of composites. After modification, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of carbon fibers composites are increased from 44.3 to 60.7 MPa and from 43.1 to 75.9 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the surface free energy of carbon fibers is increased by 65.6%. The improved interfacial properties endow carbon fiber composites with better mechanical properties, leading to an increased tensile strength of composites from 1063 to 1279 MPa and total absorbed energy of impact experiment from 1.22 to 1.75 J. Meanwhile, the dynamic mechanical properties and hydrothermal aging resistance are also enhanced significantly. The storage modulus increases from 64.3 to 74.1 GPa. The markedly enhancement of interfacial mechanical properties and mechanical properties could be attributed to the improved resin wettability, enhanced mechanical interlocking and increased chemical bonding induced by the existence of C3N4 on the carbon fiber surface.

AB ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by deoxidizing ZnO powder in a vacuum drying process. This process reduces the size of the NPs and increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies on their surfaces. ZnO NPs with sufficient oxygen vacancies are highly effective for the photodecomposition of methylene blue (MB) dye in water under ultraviolet irradiation. The MB degradation efficiency exceeds 99 percent after 50 min of light irradiation, and the catalytic property of the NPs remains stable over several complete degradation cycles. It is revealed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface, and the photocatalytic activity, are both higher for smaller NPs. Oxygen vacancies reduce the recombination rate of photo-generated charge carriers by capturing the electrons and hence, improve the efficiency of redox reactions. In addition, a smaller particle size leads to a larger specific surface area and a higher photonic efficiency for the ZnO NPs.

AB The oxidized kappa-carrageenans with different oxidation levels were prepared through the hydrogen peroxide and copper sulfate redox system. The oxidation level of oxidized kappa-carrageenan was successfully controlled by adjusting the dosage of hydrogen peroxide. The results showed that the microtopography of oxidized kappa-carrageenan changed from rough granules to smooth flakes, mainly resulting from the easily melting property of oxidized kappa-carrageenan induced by introduced carboxyl and aldehyde groups. Especially, the antibacterial activity of oxidized kappa-carrageenans against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was systematically investigated. The results showed that the oxidized kappa-carrageenan could damage the bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane and suppress the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The oxidized kappa-carrageenan possessed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which may be used as a new antibacterial agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB NiO microspheres with well-defined hollow structure were successfully obtained using spherical yeast as a natural bio-template. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphologically uniform NiO hollow microspheres prepared with yeast template after calcination had an averaged diameter of 1.5 -2 mu m and the shell thickness of similar to 500 nm. The concentration of Ni(NO3)(2), calcination temperature and aging time play important roles on the crystal phase and morphologies of the NiO hollow microspheres. Meanwhile, the NiO/C hollow microspheres were successfully fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method using glucose as carbon source. A possible formation mechanism of forming NiO/C hollow microspheres was proposed and the electrochemical performance of the NiO/C hollow microspheres as anode material for Li-ion batteries was investigated. Compared with the samples prepared without template or without carbon coating, the as-prepared NiO/C hollow microspheres show higher discharge capacity and better cycle performance as an anode material in Li-ion batteries.

AB Visible-light-responsive ZnO/NiO/In2O3 mixed metal oxide (ZNI-MMO) photoelectrocatalysts with different Ni/In molar ratios were derived from corresponding ternary hydrotalcite-like precursors followed by calcination at 600 degrees C. The as-obtained samples were characterized by XRD, TGA, BET, XPS, SEM, TEM, and UV-vis spectra techniques. The optimal molar ratio of Ni/In was found to be 1:1, where the sample (ZNI-1-MMO) was formed by the aggregation of nanospheres with an average diameter of about 50 nm and a BET specific surface area of 33.80 m(2)/g. With a 1.5 V bias potential, the ZNI-1-MMO photoelectrode exhibited high photoelectrocatalytic activity toward methylene blue (MB) degradation. The photoelectrocatalytic degradation of MB followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Radical trapping experiments were conducted to probe the reactive species in the degradation processes. Results indicated that h(+) and (OH)-O-center dot may be responsible for the efficient MB removal. The photoelectrodegradation mechanism of MB by ZNI-1-MMO-1.5 V photoelectrode was also discussed.

AB This research presents an optimum design scheme and a hierarchical energy management strategy for an island PV/hydrogen/battery hybrid DC microgrid (MG). In order to efficiently utilize this DC MG, the optimum structure and sizing scheme are designed by HOMER pro (Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources) software. The designed structure of hydrogen MG includes a PV generation, a battery as well as a hydrogen subsystem which composes a fuel cell (FC) system, an electrolyzes and hydrogen tank. To improve the robustness and economy of this DC MG, this study schedules a hierarchical energy management method, including the local control layer and the system control layer. In the local control layer, the subsystems in this DC MG are controlled based on their inherent operating characteristics. And the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is applied in the system control layer, the power flow between the battery and FC is allocated to minimum the fuel consumption. An island DC MG hardware-in-loop (HIL) Simulink platform is established by RT-LAB real-time simulator, and the simulation results are presented to validate the proposed energy management strategy.

AB This study examines the influence of message framing and how a match or mismatch between message framing and individuals' regulatory focus can influence their destination image perceptions and visit intentions utilizing attribute framing and regulatory focus fit theories. This study also examines the mediating role of cognitive fluency and emotional state on attribute framing effects on destination image formation and visit intentions. Findings indicate that framing of marketing messages exerts significant influences on consumers' decision making and destination selection process. Consumers under gain-framed message condition tend to have higher destination image perceptions compared to those under loss-framed message conditions. A match between attribute framing and regulatory focus results in formation of better destination image perceptions compared to mismatch. Furthermore, cognitive fluency and emotional state mediate attribute framing effects on destination image formation.

AB Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) causes hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis (HPM) in shrimp. HPM is not normally associated with shrimp mortality, but is associated with significant growth retardation. In this study, the responses induced by EHP were investigated in hepatopancreas of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei using proteomics and metabolomics. Among differential proteins identified, several (e.g., peritrophin-44-like protein, alpha2 macroglobulin isoform 2, prophenoloxidase-activating enzymes, ferritin, Rab11A and cathepsin C) were related to pathogen infection and host immunity. Other proteomic biomarkers (i.e., farnesoic acid o-methyltransferase, juvenile hormone esterase-like carboxylesterase 1 and ecdysteroid-regulated protein) resulted in a growth hormone disorder that prevented the shrimp from molting. Both proteomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis" and "Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism") and metabolomic KEGG pathway (e.g., "Galactose metabolism" and "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids") data indicated that energy metabolism pathway was down-regulated in the hepatopancreas when infected by EHP. More importantly, the changes of hormone regulation and energy metabolism could provide much-needed insight into the underlying mechanisms of stunted growth in shrimp after EHP infection. Altogether, this study demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of microsporidial infection in the shrimp L. vannamei.

AB A low-cost wound dressing with efficient sterilization and exhibiting long-term antimicrobial activity is required for the absence of antibiotics, particularly for the wound healing of patients with chronic wounds or long-term activities under low sanitary conditions (e.g., battlefield and poverty-stricken areas). Here, a dual dynamic crosslinking hydrogel was introduced. The hydrogel was supported by gallic acid grafted chitosan and oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide as the scaffold and formed by two types of dynamic crosslinking: Schiff base, pyrogallol-Fe3+. It exhibited its adhesion, self-healing, good biocompatibility, great intrinsic antibacterial, and near-infrared photothermal conversion activity. In addition, the use of two types of polysaccharides, and the existence of the photothermal effect, making the hydrogel has the functions of accelerating gelation, degradation on-demand, and rapid sterilization. In brief, such cost-effective multifunctional hydrogel could support wound healing in patients prone to bacterial infection, and it has a promising application in the care of infected wounds.

AB Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) was applied to enhance the extraction efficacy of protein from brewer's spent grain (BSG). The effects of ultrasonic extraction conditions including power, time and duty cycle on the techno-functional properties of protein were also evaluated. The results demonstrated that in 110 mM sodium hydroxide solution, UAE working at 250 W for 20 mM under duty cycle of 60% could significantly improve the protein yield to 86.16% compared with traditional extraction without ultrasound (45.71%). The structural analysis including CD, UV-Vis, SH content results and SDS-PAGE patterns clearly showed that BSG protein was modified under ultrasonication. The extracted BSG protein increased 5.83% of beta-sheet content while decreased alpha-helix, beta-turn and random coil contents by 4.76%, 0.33% and 0.74%, respectively. Besides, SDS-PAGE pattern of protein was slightly strengthened. The enhancement in SH content and UV-Vis spectra further indicated that exposure and unfolding of protein structure occurred and thus the functional properties of BSG protein were enhanced. Indeed, fat absorption capacity, emulsifying and foaming properties of BSG protein treated by UAE were all improved except for the water absorption capacity. Thus, UAE could be a promising method to separate protein from this valuable feedstock for further utilization in the food industry.

AB Rh-based catalysts might resolve the long-standing problem of poor C1 pathway efficiency toward an ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). To facilitate the rational design and preparation of Rh-based EOR catalysts, here we fundamentally study ethanol adsorptive dissociation and oxidation on an Rh electrode surface by electrochemical infrared absorption spectroscopy. First, real-time infrared spectral results show that ethanol could be easily split on an Rh surface into COad and CHx intermediates only in alkaline media but not in acidic media. Second, the onset oxidation potential of EOR on Rh is ca. 180 mV more negative than that on Pd and Pt electrode in alkaline media. The EOR J(f)/J(b) ratio is ca. 5.73, 1.62, and 0.35 on Rh, Pt, and Pd, respectively, suggesting that COad and/or CHx intermediates could be readily oxidized into CO2 on Rh. Accordingly, the apparent selectivity efficiency of the C1 pathway (eta) is estimated to be 100% when the potential is at 0.4-0.6 V vs RHE, subsequently eta sharply decreases to zero at 0.65-0.8 V vs RHE, and then, eta gradually rebounds to ca. 15% when the potential moves positively. This work may provide some theoretical support for fabricating highly efficient EOR catalysts.

The as-prepared carbon materials were fully characterized to determine their morphology and structure features, and it was found that the obtained NPCN has a unique interconnected sheet-like morphology and a hierarchically porous structure with a relatively high specific surface area of 1540 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.85 cm(3) g(-1). Owing to the inherent nitrogen-containing functional groups existing in the silk cocoon, in-situ doping of nitrogen heteroatom can be realized by the carbonization treatment, which can efficiently boost the electrical conductivity of the porous carbon nanosheets. By employing the NPCP as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur for lithium-sulfur batteries, the resulting carbon/sulfur composite (NPCN/S) shows a remarkably improved rate performance and superior long-term cycling stability With an extremely low decay rate (0.1% per cycle) up to 300 cycles at a high rate of 2C (3350 mAg(-1)). What is more, a Coulombic efficiency of approximatively 100% is obtained. Taking into consideration various factors including sustainable development, low-cost carbon source, and facile mass production, this work shows a great scientific significance and promising prospect in scalable preparation of advanced carbon-based host matrix for the efficient immobilization of sulfur towards developing high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

AB A common variant in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), rs53576, has been broadly linked to socially related personality traits and behaviors. However, the pattern of published results is inconsistent. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the association. The literature was searched for relevant studies and effect sizes between individuals homozygous for the G allele (GG) and individuals with A allele carriers (AA/AG). Specifically, two indices of sociality were evaluated independently: i) general sociality (24 samples, n = 4955), i.e., how an individual responds to other people in general; and ii) close relationships (15 samples, n = 5262), i.e., how an individual responds to individuals with closed connections (parent-child or romantic relationship). We found positive association between the rs53576 polymorphism and general sociality (Cohen's d = 0.11, p =.02); G allele homozygotes had higher general sociality than the A allele carriers. However, the meta-analyses did not detect significant genetic association between rs53576 and close relationships (Cohen's d = 0.01, p =.64). In conclusion, genetic variation in the rs53576 influences general sociality, which further implies that it is worthy to systematically examine whether the rs53576 is a valid genetic marker for socially related psychiatric disorders.

AB Nickel selenide (NiSe) nanoparticles were grown on graphene nanosheets (GN) with different mass ratios to obtain their corresponding NiSe/GN(x) (x = 0.25 to 1.00) nanohybrids by a facile in situ hydrothermal process to integrate the advantages of the high specific surface area of graphene and the homogeneously immobilized catalytic sites of NiSe. The nanohybrid with a mass ratio of 1 : 0.50 (i.e., NiSe/GN(0.50)) exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity and electrolyte diffusion. Thus, NiSe/GN(0.50) exhibited an improved photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12% (eta = 8.62%) compared to a standard Pt (eta = 7.68%)-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). This improved PCE mainly originated from the catalytic ability of NiSe and the multiple interfacial electron transfer pathways of graphene, resulting in enhanced charge transfer and fast tri-iodide reduction kinetics at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The results obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical AC-impedance (EIS) and Tafel polarization studies validated the synergistic effects of NiSe and GN and the high potential of this nanohybrid as an efficient counter electrode (CE) for DSSCs.

AB Graphene nanomaterials have many diverse applications, but are considered to be emerging environmental pollutants. Thus, their potential environmental risks and biosafety are receiving increased attention. Bioaccumulation and toxicity evaluations in plants are essential for biosafety assessment. In this study, C-13-stable isotope labeling of the carbon skeleton of graphene oxide (GO) was applied to investigate the bioaccumulation and toxicity of GO in wheat. Bioaccumulation of GO was accurately quantified according to the C-13/C-12 ratio. Wheat seedlings were exposed to C-13-labeled GO at 1.0 mg/mL in nutrient solution for 15 d. C-13-GO accumulated predominantly in the root with a content of 112 mu g/g at day 15, hindered the development and growth of wheat plants, disrupted root structure and cellular ultrastructure, and promoted oxidative stress. The GO that accumulated in the root showed extremely limited translocation to the stem and leaves. During the experimental period, GO was excreted slowly from the root. GO inhibited the germination of wheat seeds at high concentrations (>= 0.4 mg/mL). The mechanism of GO toxicity to wheat may be associated with oxidative stress induced by GO bioaccumulation, reflected by the changes of malondialdehyde concentration, catalase activity, and peroxidase activity. The results demonstrate that 13C labeling is a promising method to investigate environmental impacts and fates of carbon nanomaterials in biological systems.

AB Clustering analysis has been widely used in statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, image processing, and so on. It is a great challenge for most existing clustering algorithms to discover clusters with arbitrary shapes. Clustering algorithms based on Minimum spanning tree (MST) are able to discover clusters with arbitrary shapes, but they are time consuming and susceptible to noise points. In this paper, we employ local density peaks (LDP) to represent the whole data set and define a shared neighbors-based distance between local density peaks to better measure the dissimilarity between objects on manifold data. On the basis of local density peaks and the new distance, we propose a novel MST-based clustering algorithm called LDP-MST. It first uses local density peaks to construct MST and then repeatedly cuts the longest edge until a given number of clusters are found. The experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets show that our algorithm is competent with state-of-the-art methods when discovering clusters with complex structures.

The membranes are formed by copolymerizing d(3) with norbornene and (3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-2-methyl-2-(3-(trimethylammonio)propyl)-2,3,3a,4,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-4,7-methanoisoindol-2-ium iodide (a(3)) at varying ratios. The water uptake is 41.35% at 60 degrees C, and ion exchange capacity is 2.35 mequiv g(-1) for a mole ratio of a(3), norbornene, and d(3) (1:6:3). The conductivity is 12, 37, and 40 mS cm(-1) when d(3) is decreased. Meanwhile, the conductivity increases quickly with increasing the temperature. Furthermore, the mechanical properties and thermal properties are improved, attributed to the increased cross-linker. The membrane has a tensile strength of 41.3 MPa and the elongation at break of 38.0 %, and the 5 wt% loss temperature for membrane is approximate to 159 degrees C. The H-2/O-2 single fuel cells with this membrane show a maximum power density of 124 mW cm(-2) at 50 degrees C. The cross-linked membranes demonstrate high-dimensional stability in alkaline solution.

TI High-Power CO2-to-C2 Electroreduction on
   Ga-Spaced, Square-like Cu Sites
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY

DT Article
ID ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; CO2; SURFACE; CARBON
AB The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon (C-2) products on Cu-based catalysts is strongly affected by the surface coverage of adsorbed CO (*CO) intermediates and the subsequent C-C coupling. However, the increased *CO coverage inevitably leads to strong *CO repulsion and a reduced C-C coupling efficiency, thus resulting in suboptimal CO2-to-C-2 activity and selectivity, especially at ampere-level electrolysis current densities. Herein, we developed an atomically ordered Cu9Ga4 intermetallic compound consisting of Cu square-like binding sites interspaced by catalytically inert Ga atoms. Compared to Cu(100) previously known with a high C-2 selectivity, the Ga-spaced, square-like Cu sites presented an elongated Cu-Cu distance that allowed to reduce *CO repulsion and increased *CO coverage simultaneously, thus endowing more efficient C-C coupling to C-2 products than Cu(100) and Cu(111). The Cu9Ga4 catalyst exhibited an outstanding CO2-to-C-2 electroreduction, with a peak C-2 partial current density of 1207 mA cm(-2) and a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 71%. Moreover, the Cu9Ga4 catalyst demonstrated a high-power (similar to 200 W) electrolysis capability with excellent electrochemical stability.

AB Construction of durable multi-function electrocatalysts for hydrogen production is still highly challenging. Herein, we report a hierarchical integrated tri-functional heterogeneous CNTs/MoC/CoNiMo electrode for HER and related OER/UOR. The carbon-protected Ni nanoparticles yield abundant gamma-NiOOH active intermediates to boost OER/UOR, while DFT calculations verify Mo migration induced by MoC and CoNiMo alloy under negative potentials generates HER super-active sites on Mo-rich surfaces. Additionally, the parallel aligned nanosheets with out-plane extended CNTs arrays can guide the rapid bubbles release and expand the accessible surface area. Therefore, the optimized CNT/MoC/NMC-3 electrode can achieve overpotentials of 51 mV (HER) and 226 mV (OER), with low potential threshold of 1.257 V (UOR) at 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the assembled symmetric urea electrolyzer reaches a 1.291 V cell voltage at 10 mA cm-2. This work provides a novel strategy for heterostructure multi-component integration for achieving high-efficiency hydrogen production and urea-containing wastewater purification.

AB Catalytic and sensing performance of ZnO/Ag nanocomposites greatly depends on the synthesis method used for its production, presenting both challenges and opportunities for optimization. A polymer-network gel process is one of the promising techniques that enables cheap and efficient synthesis of photoactive ZnO/Ag nanocomposites. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of ZnO/Ag interfaces are not completely understood, and the photocatalytic efficiency of the ZnO/Ag nanocomposites produced by a simple gel process is not sufficient. In this paper we describe a comparative study on the one- and two-step polymer network gel synthesis techniques, and investigate the mechanisms that account for the significant differences in the observed performance of ZnO/Ag produced by these two methods. The ZnO/Ag nano-composites synthesized by the two-step method exhibit remarkably enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for Methylene blue, Methyl orange, Rhodamine B, Malachite Green and Formaldehyde (HCHO) under UV light irradiation and simulated sunlight. As the gas sensing material, the ZnO/Ag nanocomposites synthesized by the two-step method show the higher sensitivity and better stability and selectivity. The microstructures and optical characteristics of the samples were revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, room temperature photoluminescence measurements, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis. Samples synthesized by the two-step process possess a more uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, a smaller Ag crystallite size, and a narrower bandgap. Chemically, more oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl radicals are present in the samples synthesized by the two-step process. Jointly, these factors favor enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, and sensitivities of the sensors. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Child health is not only a key indicator of overall quality of public health, but also vital for the future economic development of a country. In recent years, with unprecedented urbanization of China, many children in rural areas have been left behind while their parents migrate to urban areas to seek employment opportunities. Thus, it is considerably important for us to understand the effects of lack of parental care on the health status of left-behind children. Using data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we find that the left-behind children in rural areas are significantly 20.0% more likely to get sick or develop chronic conditions than those living with their parents. We also find that girls are more vulnerable than boys and younger children are more vulnerable than older children to lack of parental care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Trans-anethole (AT) has a variety of antimicrobial properties and is widely used as food functional ingredient. However, the applications of AT are limited due to its low water solubility, strong odor and low physicochemical stability. Therefore, the aim of this work was to encapsulate AT with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) for obtaining inclusion complex by co-precipitation method. The measurements effectively confirmed the formation of inclusion complex between AT and beta-CD. The results showed that the inclusion complex presented new solid crystalline phases and was more thermally stable than the physical mixture and beta-CD. The phase solubility study showed that the aqueous solubility of AT was increased by being included in beta-CD. The calculated stability constant of inclusion complex was 1195 M-1, indicating the strong interaction between AT and beta-CD. Furthermore, the release study suggested that beta-CD provided the protection for AT against evaporation. The release behavior of AT from the inclusion complex was controlled. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Identifying factors for the prediction of depression is a long-standing research topic in psychiatry and psychology. Perceived stress, which reflects the tendency to appraise one's life situations as stressful and overwhelming, has emerged as a stable predictor for depressive symptoms. However, the neurobiological bases of perceived stress and how perceived stress influences depressive symptoms in the healthy brain remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated these issues in 217 healthy adolescents by estimating the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A whole-brain correlation analysis showed that higher levels of perceived stress were associated with greater fALFF in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), which is a core brain region for cognitive control and emotion regulation-related processes. Mediation analysis further indicated that perceived stress mediated the link between the fALFF in the left SFG and depressive symptoms. Importantly, our results remained significant even when excluding the influences of head motion, anxiety, SFG gray matter structure, and school environment. Altogether, our findings suggested that the fALFF in the left SFG is a neurofunctional marker of perceived stress in adolescents and revealed a potential indirect effect of perceived stress on the association between the SFG spontaneous activity and depressive symptoms.

AB Iron-nitrogen-carbon nanoparticles modified porous graphene (Fe-N-C/PGR) was synthesized from the pyrolysis of porous freeze-dried composites of iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc) nanoclusters and graphene oxide (GO). By pyrolysis in argon atmosphere, the GO was reduced into graphene (GR), and the FePc nanoclusters were converted to Fe-N-C nanoparticles on the GR surface. The morphologies and composition of the resulted Fe-N-C/PGR composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectra. The Fe-N-C/PGR composites exhibited three-dimensional interpenetrated porous structure, and many particles with Fe-N-C active sites were distributed on the GR nanosheets. Electrocatalytic properties of the Fe-N-C/PGR composites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. For the Fe-N-C/PGR composites with 3:1 mass ratio of FePc nanoclusters to GO precursor, it showed the highest electrocatalytic activity with the peak current density of 5.82 mA cm(-2) at -0.39 V, which was ascribed to the synergistic effect of Fe-N-C active sites and PGR with good porous structures. The electron transfer number of 3.94 for the Fe-N-C/PGR composite indicated a direct 4-electron pathway for the ORR. Furthermore, the Fe-N-C/PGR composites showed high stability and better tolerance to methanol than the commercial 20% Pt/C catalysts. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Graphene sponge (GS) has been widely employed for water purification, but adsorption capacity loss frequently occurs during the formation of spongy structure. In this study, we reported the hydrothermal preparation of S-doped GS for the removal of Cu2+ with a huge adsorption capacity of 228 mg/g, 40 times higher than that of active carbon. The adsorption isotherm could be well fitted into the Freundlich model with a K-F value of 36.309 (L/mg)(1/n). The equilibrium adsorption could be fully achieved in the first 5 min. In the thermodynamics study, the negative Delta G indicated that the adsorption was spontaneous and physisorption in nature. The positive Delta H implied that the adsorption was endothermic. The changes of both pH and ionic strength had no apparent influence on the adsorption. S-doped GS could be easily regenerated by washing with acidic thiourea. Moreover, S-doped GS could be used for the adsorption of other heavy metal ions, too. The implication to the applications of S-doped GS in water treatment is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cadmium (Cd)-caused water environment pollution has become a matter of concern. Gill is an organ with respiratory and mucosal immune functions, and is also one of the organs directly attacked by pollutants. It was found that excess Cd could cause Cd accumulation and gill injury in carp. However, the mechanism of Cd-caused damage in common carp gills is still unclear. Oxidative stress, immunosuppression, and apoptosis took part in the mechanism of poisoning caused by some harmful substances. The aim of the study was to investigate complex molecular mechanism of apoptotic injury caused by Cd in common carp gills. Hence, in this study, we established a Cd poisoning model to explore whether excess Cd can induce apoptosis through observing histomorphology and apoptotic cells; and determining mineral elements, oxidative stress-related factors, immune-related, and apoptosis-related genes in common carp gills. Fifty-four fish were randomly separated into the control group and the Cd group and were cultured for 45 days. The water of the control group was drinking water and the water of the Cd group was CdCl2-added drinking water (0.26 mg/L Cd). In our results, we found that excess Cd increased Cd level, decreased the levels of essential mineral elements (Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn), damaged mitochondria, and increased apoptotic cells in common carp gills, meaning that excess Cd caused Cd accumulation and apoptotic injury via mitochondrion in common carp gills. Furthermore, we found that Cd inhibited anti-apoptosis-related gene Bcl-2 and stimulated pro-apoptosis-related genes (JNK, FoxO3a, PUMA, Box, Apaf-1, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3) on 15th, 30th, and 45th days. Above data meant that Cd exposure caused apoptosis via mitochondrion and JNK-FoxO3a-PUMA pathway in common carp gills. In addition, in our experiment, Cd treatment increased oxidants (H2O2 and MDA) and decreased antioxidants (CAT, GPx, GST, SOD, T-AOC, and GSH), indicating that Cd caused oxidative stress via oxidation/antioxidation imbalance. Meanwhile, compared to the control group, T-help 17 (Th17) cell-related factors (IL-17, TNF-alpha, and ROR gamma) were up-regulated, regulatory T (Treg) cell-related factors (IL-10 and Foxp3) were down-regulated, and IL-17/IL-10, TNF-alpha/IL-10, and ROR gamma/Foxp3 were increased in Cd-exposed group; meaning that excess Cd induced immunosuppression via the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells. Taken together, our findings indicated that JNK-FoxO3a-PUMA pathway and mitochondrion participated in oxidative stress and immunosuppression-mediated apoptosis caused by Cd in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) gills. Our data provided new perspectives on the negative effects of heavy metal pollutants on fish.

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antibacterial agents because of their significant antimicrobial activities and little sign of antimicrobial resistance. However, the relatively high toxicity to healthy cells and low penetration efficiency into bacterial biofilms prevent their further use in biomedical applications. In order to decrease the cytotoxicity of the AgNPs to mammalian cells while increasing their antibacterial and antibiofilm efficiency, a novel nanocomposite composed of AgNPs decorated with carboxyl betaine groups (AgNPs-LA-OB) was prepared. The zwitterion modified AgNPs showed a pH responsive transition from a negative charge to a positive charge, which enabled the AgNPs to be compatible with mammalian cells and red blood cells (RBCs) in healthy tissues (pH similar to 7.4), while strongly adhering quickly to negatively charged bacterial surfaces at infectious sites (pH similar to 5.5) based on electrostatic attraction. The AgNPs penetrated deeply into bacterial biofilms and killed the bacteria living in an acidic environment. The results indicated that the designed zwitterion NPs for antibacterial applications and eradication of bacterial biofilms, which also had particles that did not harm the healthy cells showed promise for future use in humans. The satisfactory selectivity for bacteria compared to RBCs, together with their potent eradication of bacterial biofilms make AgNPs-LA-OB a promising antibacterial nanomedicine in biomedical fields.

AB Biofilm microenvironment (BME)-activated antimicrobial agents display great potential for improved biofilm-related infection therapy because of their superior specificities and sensitivities, effective eliminations, and minimal side effects. Herein, BME-activated Fe-doped polydiaminopyridine nanofusiform-mediated single-atom nanozyme (FePN SAzyme) is presented for photothermal/chemodynamic synergetic bacteria-infected wound therapy. The photothermal therapy (PTT) function of SAzyme can be specifically initiated by the high level of H2O2 and further accelerated through mild acid within the inflammatory environment through "two-step rocket launching-like" process. Additionally, the enhanced chemodynamic therapy (CDT) for the FePN SAzyme can also be endowed by producing hydroxyl radicals through reacting with H2O2 and consuming glutathione (GSH) of the BME, thereby contributing to more efficient synergistic therapeutic effect. Meanwhile, FePN SAzyme could catalyze biofilm-overexpressed H2O2 decomposing into O-2 and overcome the hypoxia of biofilm, which significantly enhances the susceptibility of biofilm and increases the synergistic efficacy. Most importantly, the synergistic therapy of bacterial-induced infection diseases can be switched on by the internal and external stimuli simultaneously, resulting in minimal nonspecific damage to healthy tissue. These remarkable characteristics of FePN SAzyme not only develop an innovative strategy for the BME-activated combination therapy but also open a new avenue to explore other nanozyme-involved nanoplatforms for bacterial biofilm infections.

AB Microbial communities of human gut directly influence health and bear adaptive potential to different geography environment and lifestyles. However, knowledge about the influences of altitude and geography on the gut microbiota of Tibetans is currently limited. In this study, fecal microbiota from 208 Tibetans across six different locations were analyzed by MiSeq sequencing; these locations included Gannan, Gangcha, Tianzhu, Hongyuan, Lhasa and Nagqu, with altitudes above sea level ranging from 2800 m to 4500 m across the Tibetan plateau. Significant differences were observed in microbial diversity and richness in different locations. At the phylum level, gut populations of Tibetans comprised Bacteroidetes (60.00%), Firmicutes (29.04%), Proteobacteria (5.40%), and Actinobacteria (3.85%) and were marked by a low ratio (0.48) of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. Analysis based on operational taxonomic unit level revealed that core microbiotas included Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia, whereas Prevotella predominated all locations, except Gangcha. Four community state types were detected in all samples, and they mainly belong to Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcaceae. Principal component analysis and related correspondence analysis results revealed that bacterial profiles in Tibetan guts varied significantly with increasing altitude, BMI, and age, and facultative anaerobes were rich in Tibetan guts. Gut microbiota may play important roles in regulating high-altitude and geographical adaptations.

AB This paper investigates the source localization problem based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements in the presence of random noises in both the TDOA and sensor location measurements. We formulate the localization problem as a constrained weighted least squares problem which is an indefinite quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. Owing to the non-convex nature of this problem, it is difficult to obtain a global solution. However, by exploiting the hidden convexity of this problem, we reformulate it to a convex optimization problem. We further derive a primal-dual interior point algorithm to reach a global solution efficiently. The proposed method is shown to analytically achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under some mild approximations. Moreover, when the location geometry is not desirable, the proposed algorithm can efficiently avoid the ill-conditioning problem. Simulations are used to corroborate the theoretical results which demonstrate the good performance, robustness and high efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with the robust H-infinity control issues for uncertain T-S fuzzy systems (TSFSs) with time-varying delays and stochastic packet dropouts. An improved time-delay interval segmentation method is developed to construct a more general Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with relaxed conditions, which fully considers information concerning time delays and the derivative information of both states and time delays. Then, by applying some valid integral inequalities, some new criteria are established. Furthermore, based on the above methods, the desired randomly occurring asynchronous or synchronized state feedback controllers are designed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop TSFSs. Finally, four numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Here, we introduce phase change mechanisms in lead-free piezoceramics as a strategy to utilize attendant volume change for harvesting large electrostrain. In the newly developed (K,Na)NbO3 solid-solution at the polymorphic phase boundary we combine atomic mapping of the local polar vector with in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density functional theory to uncover the phase change and interpret its underlying nature. We demonstrate that an electric field-induced phase transition between orthorhombic and tetragonal phases triggers a dramatic volume change and contributes to a huge effective piezoelectric coefficient of 1250 pm V-1 along specific crystallographic directions. The existence of the phase transition is validated by a significant volume change evidenced by the simultaneous recording of macroscopic longitudinal and transverse strain. The principle of using phase transition to promote electrostrain provides broader design flexibility in the development of high-performance piezoelectric materials and opens the door for the discovery of high-performance future functional oxides.
   Functional oxides with coexisting states of comparable energy typically exhibit extraordinary responses to external stimuli. Here, the authors demonstrate that coexisting phase structures provide large electric field-triggered volume change.

AB Background: Chinese adolescents encounter a lot of stressors, such as academic burden and parental pressure. However, little is known about their perception of stress. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is a widely used instrument to measure individuals' appraisal of global stress in academic research and clinical practice. The current study aimed to evaluate the best-fit factor structure model of the PSS-10 and the measurement invariance across genders in Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: A total of 1,574 Chinese senior high school students completed the PSS-10 (mean age = 15.26 +/- 0.56 years, female = 54%). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to determine the factor structure of the PSS-10. Multigroup CFA was carried out to test the measurement invariance of the PSS-10 across genders. A subsample (N = 1,060) answered additional questionnaires measuring stressful life events, anxiety, and depression to examine the convergent and concurrent validity of the PSS-10.
   Results: The two-factor model was supported [i.e., chi(2) (34) = 332.224, p < 0.001; non-normal fit index (NNFI) = 0.901, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.925, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.075, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.051]. Importantly, the model exhibited strong measurement invariance across female and male groups. Furthermore, the PSS-10 had adequate convergent validity for stressful life events (number: r = 0.13, p < 0.001; impact: r = 0.23, p < 0.001) and could explain incremental variance in predicting anxiety (Delta R-2 = 0.13, beta = 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (Delta R-2 = 0.16, beta = 0.41, p < 0.001), suggesting excellent concurrent validity.
   Conclusion: A two-factor model best fits the structure of PSS-10 among Chinese adolescents, with strong measurement invariance between gender groups, demonstrating its validity for assessing perceived stress among Chinese adolescents.

AB Dialdehyde-amyloses, dicarboxyl-amyloses and dialdehyde-carboxyl-amyloses with different oxidation levels were prepared and used to study the effects of aldehyde and carboxyl groups on the antibacterial activity of oxidized amyloses. The results showed that dicarboxyl-amyloses presented antibacterial activity through acidic pH effect produced by carboxyl groups, which was easily reduced or eliminated by adjusting pH. Dialdehyde-amyloses possessed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity owing to the reactivity of aldehyde groups rather than acidic pH effect. Aldehyde would irreversibly damage bacterial cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in decay and death of bacterial cells. It is interesting that the antibacterial properties of dialdehyde-carboxyl-amyloses were improved to some extent compared to dialdehyde-amyloses. The improvement of antibacterial effect of dialdehyde-carboxyl-amyloses may be due to the increasing dispersibility endowed by carboxyl groups, which could effectively enhance the interaction between dialdehyde-carboxyl-amyloses and bacteria.

AB Nanotechniques that can improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy (RT) by integrating it with multimodal imaging are highly desirable.
   Results In this study, we fabricated Bi2S3 nanorods that have attractive features such as their ability to function as contrast agents for X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging as well as good biocompatibility. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that the Bi2S3 nanoagents could potentiate the lethal effects of radiation via amplifying the local radiation dose and enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of RT by augmenting the photo-thermal effect. Furthermore, the nanoagent-mediated hyperthermia could effectively increase the oxygen concentration in hypoxic regions thereby inhibiting the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha). This, in turn, interfered with DNA repair via decreasing the expression of DNA repair-related proteins to overcome radio-resistance. Also, RT combined with nanoagent-mediated hyperthermia could substantially suppress tumor metastasis via down-regulating angiogenic factors.
   Conclusion In summary, we constructed a single-component powerful nanoagent for CT/PA imaging-guided tumor radiotherapy and, most importantly, explored the potential mechanisms of nanoagent-mediated photo-thermal treatment for enhancing the efficacy of RT in a synergistic manner.

AB Fruit rotting at the postharvest stage severely limits their marketing supply chains and shelf-life. Thus, developing a green and cost-effective approach to extend the shelf-life of perishable foods is highly desired. In this study, inspired by the mussel-adhesion strategy, a multifunctional fruit coating material has been developed using a quaternized catechol-functionalized chitosan (CQ-CS) grafted with 2, 3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and 3, 4-dihydroxy benzaldehyde. The as-prepared CQ-CS coating exhibited excellent mechanical properties, universal surface adhesion abilities, antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities without any potential toxicity effects. Using strawberry and banana as model fruits, we showed that the CQ-CS coating could effectively maintain the fruit's firmness and color, decrease the weight loss rate, and prevent microbial growth, thus finally extending their shelf- life when compared to uncoated samples, indicating the universal application of the asprepared CQ-CS coating. These findings demonstrated that this novel conformal coating of CQ-CS has great potential for fruit preservation in the food industry.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate effects of dietary grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) supplementation on meat quality, muscle fiber characteristics and antioxidant capacity of finishing pigs. The data showed GSPE increased pH(24 h), redness, crude protein content and decreased shear force, drip loss(48 h), lactate content and glycolytic potential in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, accompanied by increased contents of total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), n-3 PUFA, and the ratio of PUFA to saturated fatty acid. GSPE promoted MyHC I mRNA and slow MyHC protein expression, and increased slow-twitch fiber percentage. The activities of total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in LD muscle were increased by GSPE while malondialdehyde content was decreased. Together, this study demonstrated that dietary GSPE supplementation can effectively improve the color, water-holding capacity, tenderness and nutritional value of pork, and increase slow-twitch fiber percentage and antioxidant capacity of finishing pigs.

AB It is critical to evaluate the quality of clusters for most cluster analysis. A number of cluster validity indexes have been proposed, such as the Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin indexes. However, these validity indexes cannot be used to process clusters with arbitrary shapes. Some researchers employ graph-based distance to cluster nonspherical data sets, but the computation of graph-based distances between all pairs of points in a data set is time-consuming. A potential solution is to select some representative points. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel Local Cores-based Cluster Validity (LCCV) index to improve the performance of Silhouette index. Local cores, with local maximum density, are selected as representative points. Since graph-based distance is used to evaluate the dissimilarity between local cores, the LCCV index is effective for obtaining the optimal cluster number for data sets containing clusters with arbitrary shapes. Moreover, a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the LCCV index is proposed. The experimental results on synthetic and real data sets indicate that the new index outperforms existing ones.

AB At present, selective and efficient removal of cesium ions (cs(+)) from nuclear waste is of significant importance but still challenging. In this study, an easy-to-get and low-cost hydrogel adsorbent has been developed for effective adsorption and removal of Cs+ from aqueous environment. The novel Cs+-recognizable poly(acrylic acid-co-benzo-18-crown-6-acrylamide) (poly(AAc-co-B18C6Am)) hydro gel is specifically designed with a synergistic effect, in which the AAc units are designed to attract Cs+ via electrostatic attraction and the B18C6Am units are designed to capture the attracted Cs+ by forming stable 2:1 "sandwich" complexes. The poly(AAc-co-B18C6Am) hydrogels are simply synthesized by thermally initiated free-radical copolymerization and display excellent Cs+ adsorption from commonly coexisting metal ions. Important parameters affecting the adsorption are investigated comprehensively, and the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms are also discussed systematically. The poly(AAc-co-B18C6Am) hydrogels exhibit rapid Cs+ adsorption within 30 min and the adsorption process is governed by the pseudo-second order model. Adsorption isotherm results demonstrate that the equilibrium data are well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model, indicating that the Cs+ adsorption is probably a monolayer adsorption process. Such Cs+-recognizable hydrogel materials based on the host-guest complexation are promising as efficient and feasible candidates for adsorption and removal of radioactive Cs+ from nuclear contaminants.

AB The purpose of the study was to determine the inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus fermentum Suo (LF-Suo) on HCl/ethanol induced gastric injury in ICR (Institute for Cancer Research) mice and explain the mechanism of these effects through the molecular biology activities of LF-Suo. The studied mice were divided into four groups: healthy, injured, LF-Suo-L and LF-Suo-H group. After the LF-Suo intragastric administration, the gastric injury area was reduced compared to the injured group. The serum MOT (motilin), SP (substance P), ET (endothelin) levels of LF-Suo treated mice were lower, and SS (somatostatin), VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) levels were higher than the injured group mice. The cytokine IL-6 (interleukin 6), IL-12 (interleukin 12), TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and IFN-gamma (interferon-gamma) serum levels were decreased after the LF-Suo treatment. The gastric tissues SOD (superoxide dismutase), GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase), NO (nitric oxide) and activities of LF-Suo treated mice were increased and MDA (malondialdehyde) activity was decreased compared to the injured group mice. By the RT-PCR assay, LF-Suo raised the occludin, EGF (epidermal growth factor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), Fit-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1), I kappa B-alpha (inhibitor kappaB-alpha), nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase), eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT (catalase) mRNA or protein expressions and reduced the COX-2, NF-kappa B (nuclear factor kappaB), and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) expressions in gastric tissues compared to the gastric injured group mice. A high concentration (1.0 x 10(9) CFU/kg b.w.) of LF-Suo treatment showed stronger anti-gastric injury effects compared to a low concentration of (0.5 x 10(9) CFU/kg b.w.) of LF-Suo treatment. LF-Suo also showed strong survival in pH 3.0 man-made gastric juice and hydrophobic properties. These results indicate that LF-Suo has potential use as probiotics for its gastric injury treatment effects.

AB Low temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma-induced polymerization was demonstrated as a fast and facile strategy for tailoring of packing phase of COF-1 as well as preparing diverse covalent organic frameworks (COFs) including both two-dimensional (2D) COFs and three-dimensional (3D) COFs. By regulating the solvents, the fast construction of well-ordered AB staggered COF-1 and AA eclipsed COF-1 was facilely realized in minutes. The plasma approach presented here led to the rapid preparation of eight classical 2D COFs, including boronate ester-linkage (COF-5, COF-8 and COF-10), azine-linkage (NUS-2), beta-ketoenamine-linkage (TpPa, TPBD), imine-linkage (ILCOF-1, Py-COF), and 3D-COF-102 (boroxine linkage) in less than 1 hour. Different from conventional methods, the proposed methodology required much less time, lower power, no extra heating, inert-gas protection and pressure. The fast nucleation and growth of COFs with good crystallinity, morphology and thermal stability can be achieved under mild conditions.

AB In this study, a novel nanofiber material with Polylactic acid (PLA), natural plant polysaccharides-Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) and Rosmarinic acid (RA) as the raw materials to facilitate wound healing was well prepared through coaxial electrospinning. The morphology of RA-BSP-PVA@PLA nanofibers was characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the successful formation of core-shell structure was verified under confocal laser microscopy (CLSM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). RA-BSP-PVA@PLA exhibited suitable air permeability for wound healing, as indicated by the result of the water vapor permeability (WVTR) study. The results of tension test results indicated the RA-BSP-PVA@PLA nanofiber exhibited excellent flexibility and better accommodates wounds. Moreover, the biocompatibility of RA-BSP-PVA@PLA was examined through MTT assay. Lastly, RA-BSP-PVA@PLA nanofibers can induce wound tissue growth, as verified by the rat dorsal skin wound models and tissue sections. Furthermore, RA-BSP-PVA@PLA can facilitate the proliferation and transformation of early wound macrophages, and down-regulate MPO+ expression of on the wound, thus facilitating wound healing, as confirmed by the result of immunohistochemical. Thus, RA-BSP-PVA@PLA nanofibers show great potential as wound dressings in wound healing.

AB Recently, catalyst-free activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) via visible light has been extensively investigated. However, the intrinsic relationship between the activation of PDS and the characteristics of pollutants has been largely ignored. This study reports that PDS activation by visible light without any artificial catalyst for the removal of fluoroquinolones (FQs), which reduced the adverse on ecological environment and human health concerns. Importantly, the mechanism of PDS activation by the excited triplet state of FQs ((3)FQs*) was proposed. Experimental results demonstrated PDS could generate more center dot OH with the existence of (3)FQs*. Meanwhile, the electron transfer pathways from FQs or (3)FQs* to PDS were studied. Both radical and non-radical oxidation reactions lead to the degradation of FQs in the Vis/PDS system. The degradation pathways and reactive sites were clarified by QTOF analysis and DFT calculations. Additionally, the degradation experiments of various contaminants demonstrated that the system showed excellent selective oxidation for FQs.

AB Oriented TiO2 nanorod array (TiO2 NA) is very attractive in the fields of halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its fewer grain boundaries and high crystallinity for effective charge collection. The optimization of TiO2 nanostructures has been proved to be an effective approach for efficient PSCs. On the other hand, tuning the crystallization of perovskite films on top of the TiO2 NA is very important for efficient TiO2-NA based PSCs. Herein, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) were used to study the crystallization of different mixed-ion Cs-0.1(FA(0.83)MA(0.17))(0.9)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)(3) perovskite (in which MA = CH3NH3+ and FA = CH(NH2)(2)(+)) films, from different perovskite precursor concentrations, on the TiO2 nanorod arrays. A mechanism was proposed to reveal the inherent connection between the precursor concentration and the crystallite growth of the perovskite film prepared with anti solvent quenching process. Meanwhile, both faster charge separation at perovskite/TiO2 NA interface and longer charge transport were observed on thicker perovskite film with larger grains, revealed by the time-resolved method. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) results indicated that too thick perovskite film impaired the charge collection owing to the increased recombination. By balancing the charge collection and film thickness, highly efficient PSC5 were prepared with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.33% with little hysteresis. The study highlights a great potential of incorporating oriented one-dimensional electron extraction materials in high-performance PSCs and other applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Both porous and scale-like wall zirconia (ZrO2) hollow microspheres were successfully prepared through a facile and mild microwave solvothermal method using the rape pollen as biotemplates. The formation mechanisms were discussed for both ZrO2 hollow microspheres fabricated using pollen biotemplate with different pollen treatments. The porous ZrO2 hollow microspheres had a specific surface area of 40.92 m(2).g(-1), significantly higher than scale-like wall ZrO2 hollow microspheres (24.79 m(2).g(-1)) and ZrO2 particles (27.99 m(2).g(-1)). The adsorption test results showed that porous ZrO2 hollow microspheres had a higher adsorption capability (96.98 g.mg(-1)) than scale-like wall ZrO2 hollow microspheres (38.55 g.mg(-1)) and ZrO2 particles (32.03 g.mg(-1)) for Congo red. The adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption process was homogeneous adsorption of monolayer.

AB The availability of the underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) based on red (R), green (G) and blue (B) lights makes the realization of the RGB wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) UWOC system possible. By properly mixing RGB lights to form white light, the WDM UWOC system has prominent potentiality for simultaneous underwater illumination and high-speed communication. In this work, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate a 9.51-Gb/s WDM UWOC system using a red-emitting laser diode (LD), a single-mode pigtailed green-emitting LD and a multi-mode pigtailed blue-emitting LD. By employing 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in the demonstration, the red-light, the green-light and the blue-light LDs successfully transmit signals with the data rates of 4.17 Gb/s, 4.17 Gb/s and 1.17 Gb/s, respectively, over a 10-m underwater channel. The corresponding bit error rates (BERs) are 2.2 x 10(-3), 2.0 x 10(-3) and 2.3 x 10(-3), respectively, which are below the forward error correction (FEC) threshold of 3.8 x 10(-3).

AB As a new strategy for wound management, probiotics are highly sensitive to the external environment during use. In this study, an attempt is made to apply oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide (OBSP) hydrogel as a delivery system to put up a physical barrier to probiotics. Bletilla striata, as a famous traditional Chinese med-icine, has been widely used for over 1500 years to promote wound healing. Firstly, probiotic-bound OBSP-Chitosan composite hydrogel (OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly approach. Subsequently, the SEM image, swelling and rheological properties of the OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel were investigated. Notably, composite probiotics to wounds are an attractive novel intervention that significantly improves the antibacterial properties of the hydrogel and avoids the pitfalls of many antibiotic therapies. Furthermore, the full-thickness skin defect model in vivo indicated an outstanding wound healing efficacy. Therefore, OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel could be applied as a promising dressing in the wound healing.

AB In order to improve the scale inhibition efficiency of existing polyepoxysuccinic acid (PESA) and to study the impact of their molecular structure on scale inhibition efficiency, a series of PESA with linear and hyper-branched structure have been designed and synthesized through copolymerization reaction with glycidyl and epoxy succinate. The scale inhibition behavior of PESA with linear and hyper-branched structure against CaCO3 and CaSO4 scales was evaluated using static scale inhibition method, and their ability to retard deposition of CaCO3 was also examined. The experimental results showed that, for CaCO3 and CaSO4 , the PESA with hyper-branched structure provides a scale inhibiting efficiency as high as 95.9% and 94.3%, respectively, at an inhibitor concentration of 15 mg/L. In addition, the processes of crystal nucleation, growth and crystal morphology have been analyzed. The experimental results show that the PESA with hyper-branched structure not only prolongs the induction period of CaCO3 crystal nucleation, but also reduces the number of crystal nuclei and changes the size and morphology of the CaCO(3 )crystal. Moreover, the FTIR, SEM and XRD analyses showed that the PESA with hyper-branched structure can induce the irregularity of growing CaCO(3 )crystal, destroy the formation of crystals and change the polymorphs of calcium scale crystal. This conclusion indicates that the prepared PESA with hyper-branched structure has great potential for applying in the treatment of industrial water. (C) 2018 King Saud University.

AB Ammonia, a kind of gas with pungent smell, is harmful to livestock and people, and has bad influence on the atmosphere. However, the mechanism of splenic toxicity caused by ammonia is still poorly understood. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of ammonia on chicken splenic lymphocytes from the perspective of apoptosis. Chicken splenic lymphocytes were divided into the control group and the two ammonium treatment groups (1 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L ammonia), and were cultured for 24 h. CCK-8, flow cytometry (FC), fluorescence microscope, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blot were used to study the differences between different groups. The results showed that ammonia exposure increased the release of calcium(Ca)(2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondrion. Besides, we found an increase in mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), inflammation-related genes (nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)), apoptosis-related genes (B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (BAX), Cytochrome c (Cytc), apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), Caspase-9, and Caspase-3), and an increase in protein levels of NF-kappa B, iNOS, BAX, Cytc, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3. At the same time, we found a decrease level of GPx protein expression, and a decrease level of glutathione S-transferase (GST) mRNA expression, and a decrease level of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and BCL-2 mRNA and protein expression in splenic lymphocytes exposed to ammonia. Meanwhile, miR-15a expression increased under ammonia exposure. In summary, these results indicated that ammonia induced oxidative stress, promoted the release of Ca2+, Cytc, and ROS from mitochondria, and then induced mitochondria-mediated inflammatory response, finally triggered apoptosis in chicken splenic lymphocytes.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising star photocatalytic material due to features of non-toxic, inexpensive, and easy to prepare, but only exhibited poor performance by the high carrier recombination rate. In this work, engineering of 2D ultrathin and O doping into g-C3N4 was achieved by using thermal gas shocking effect induced via endogenous gases from the urea solution and C/N-steam reforming reaction. The experimental results revealed that the optimal sample exhibited the photo-degradation rates of tetracycline (TC) within 2 h were 87.2%, and the photocatalytic H(2 )evolution rate reached 6.21 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This overwhelming photocatalytic performance is attributed to following factors, including ultrathin thickness results in reduced charge transfer distance, larger specific surface area exposed more active reaction sites, and O doping forms electron-rich centers to promote carrier separation and negative shift of the conduction band for enhanced the reduction potential of photogenerated electrons. This study presents an effective strategy for preparing high active g-C3N4 photocatalysts with optimized modification.

AB Background: Capsaicin (CAP) has an anti-obesity effect that has been shown to involve the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel. Importantly, recent studies in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice show that CAP also alters gut microbiota composition and causes weight loss in HFD-fed mice. Many studies have suggested that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mediate the links between diet, gut microbiota, and fat storage.
   Objective: The present study investigated whether CAP exerted its anti-obesity effect through changes in the composition of gut microbiota and SCFAs, and whether the TRPV1 contributes to CAP'S effects against obesity in HFD-fed mice.
   Design: C57BL/6J (TRPV1+/+) and B6.129X1-Trpv1tmlJula (TRPV1-/-) mice were respectively divided into three groups (n = 6),that is SLD, HFD-fed, and CAP (2 mg/kg, po) +HFD fed and were administered respective treatment for 12 weeks.
   Results: We observed significantly lower weight gain and food intake, triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels in HFD+CAP-fed TRPV1knockout (KO) mice compared to the HFD-fed KO mice, though this effect was more obvious in wild-type (WT) mice. CAP increased the numbers of Akkermansia, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Allobaculum, Coprococcus, and S24-7, and reduced the numbers of Desuitovibrio, Escherichia, Helicobacter, and Sutierella in the HFD+CAP-fed WT and KO mice compared with HFD-fed WT and KO mice. CAP increased the relative abundances of SCFAs producing the bacterial species, which increased intestinal acetate and propionate concentrations, which were beneficial in prevention and treatment of obesity.
   Conclusions: Results from our study indicate that the reduced food intake and anti-obesity effect of CAP had been observed regardless of TRPV1 channel activation, and which is mediated by changes in the gut microbiota populations and SCFAs concentrations.

AB Yak (Bos grunniens) is an unique ruminant species in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The ruminant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota is not only associated with the nutrients metabolism, but also contributes to the host's local adaptation. Examining the microbiota between cattle and yak in different geography could improve our understanding about the role of microbiota in metabolism and adaptation. To this end, we compared the microbiota in rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum of dairy cattle, yellow cattle, and three yak herds (WQ yak, SZ yak, and ZB yak) lived in different altitude, based on sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene on Illumina Miseq. The bacterial diversity was significantly different among five breeds, whereas the difference among four stomach regions is limited. The phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominated bacteria regardless of breeds and regions. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) results showed that the microbiota in dairy cattle, yellow cattle and WQ yak significantly differed from that in SZ yak and ZB yak for all four stomach compartments. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that Prevotella and Succiniclasticum spp. were abundant in dairy cattle, yellow cattle and WQ yak, whereas the Christensenellaceae R7 group and the Lachnospiraceae UCG 008 group were prevalent in SZ yak and ZB yak. Moreover, the microbiota in WQ yak was significantly different from that in SZ yak and ZB yak, which were characterized by the higher relative abundance Romboutsia spp., Eubacterium coprostanoligenes, Acetobacter spp., Mycoplasma spp., and Rikenellaceae RC9 group. Overall, these results improves our knowledge about the GIT microbiota composition of QTP ruminant.

AB Indium oxide (In2O3) doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites were successfully synthesized through a facile microwave hydrothermal method. The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The morphology of In2O3-ZnO composites was observed to be like flowers, and the diameter of particles constituting the porous petal was about 30 nm. The photoelectrocatalytic test results showed that the photoelectrocatalytic methylene blue (MB) degradation efficiency using In2O3-ZnO nanocomposites as photocatalysts under visible light irradiation and a certain voltage could reached above 95.3% after 60 min, much higher than that of In2O3 particles and ZnO particles. The enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity was attributed to the doping of In2O3 and applied voltage, which beneficially reduced the recombination of electrons and holes in the photoelectrocatalytic process, therefore, it promoted the production of active species (center dot OH and center dot O-2(-)).

AB Dye pollution has become a serious threat to environment and human health. Although versatile hydrogels have attracted intensive attentions due to their outstanding adsorption properties, the ultrahigh adsorption capacity and mechanical property are still two critical challenges for the practical applications. Herein, a super-adsorbent poly(acrylic acid)/laponite (PAAc/Lap) nanocomposite hydrogel with ultrahigh mechanical property and adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) is prepared by incorporating physical cross-linking with sparse chemical cross-linking. The hydrogel possesses porous 3D network structures and a fairly high water penetration with 1360 times of swelling ratio, which can allow the internal adsorption sites to be fully exposed and facilitate the adsorption. The adsorption capacity of MB can reach up to 3846 mg/g, which is almost the first time that a PAAc-based adsorbent could display superior adsorption capacity of more than 3800 mg/g towards MB. Important factors affecting the adsorption are also investigated, and the adsorption behavior is well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model. More importantly, the appropriate physical cross linking and sparse chemical cross-linking in the polymeric network endows hydrogel with superior mechanical properties. The tensile stress and strain are as high as 1.18 MPa and 2192%, which can facilitate the expansive applications and practical treatment. Mechanism analyses illustrate that the electrostatic interactions and cation-exchange between the functional groups of hydrogel and MB molecules contribute to the extraordinary adsorption ability. The proposed PAAc/Lap hydrogel with ultrahigh adsorption capacity and mechanical property is highly promising as an efficient super adsorbent for water treatment.

AB Cadmium (Cd) chloride, as widely distributed toxic environmental pollutants by using in industry, severely imperils animal and human health. Pyroptosis is a Cas1-dependent pro-inflammatory programmed cell death and involves in various types of diseases. Nevertheless, the mechanism of pyroptosis and Cd-induced neurotoxicity remains obscure. To investigate the specific molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced neurotoxicity, 10 weaned piglets were randomly divided into 2 groups treated with 0 and 20 mg/kg CdCl2 in the diet for 40 days. The levels of pyroptosis, mitochondrial and inflammation-related genes were validated by qRT-PCR and WB in vivo. Our results revealed that Cd caused cerebral histopathology lesions, inducing cerebral pyroptosis and the mass generation of inflammatory cytokines, as indicated by the increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation (NLRP3, Cas1 and ASC) and the upregulation of inflammation factors IL-2, IL-6, IL-7 and inhibition of IL-10. Subsequently, further research indicated that Cd triggered pyroptosis via activating the TRAF6-IkB-alpha-NF-kappa B pathway, which interfered with the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkB-alpha. Furthermore, Cd caused mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation by inhibiting the AMPK-PGC-1 alpha-NRF1/2 signaling pathway and reduced the expression of mitochondrial-related regulatory factors OPA1, TFAM and mtDNA, resulting in the increase of NLRP3 inflammasome. Besides, we found eight hub genes (IKK, IKB-alpha, NLRP3, TRAF6, NF-kappa B, AMPK, TNF alpha and PGC-1 alpha), mainly related to the interaction between the NF-kappa B pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome. Overall, these results demonstrated that Cd could promote the IL-1 beta/IkB-alpha-NF-kappa B-NLRP3 inflammasome activation positive feedback loop to result in neuroinflammation in swine, which provided new insights in understanding Cd-induced toxicity.

AB The purpose of this research is to arouse people's cognition of the dual role of Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP)-a kind of biocompatible, biodegradable natural biological materials with myriad pharmacological activities. BSP was extracted and characterized firstly. The results indicated that BSP was composed of mannose and glucose. The backbone of BSP mainly consisted of (1 -> 4)-linked beta-D-mannopyranose. Afterwards, A 3(2) factorial design was employed for optimization of lyophilized wafers for the treatment of traumatic oral ulcer with concentrations of BSP and glycerin as independent variables. Tensile strength, mucoadhesive strength, and swelling index were measured as response variables. It was determined that the wafer prepared from a solution containing 4% (w/v) BSP and 7% (w/v) glycerin was the optimal formulation. The wafers exhibited sufficient mechanical strength and suitable surface pH. Morphology of the wafers was observed. DSC/FGA thermograms showed the presence of three peaks weight loss events and decomposition patterns. Moreover, in vivo examinations indicated that the BSP wafer significantly promoted ulcer healing at 7 days, while no statistically significant difference was observed on day 12. In conclusion, this study suggests that BSP is an ideal biomaterial for mucosal adhesion agents, playing a nontrivial role in promoting oral ulcer healing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bletilla striata has attracted extensive research interest due to the potential uses for its extracts to treat skin burns and inflammatory disorders in a clinical setting. My current research focuses on Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSP), and often ignores the residues that remain after polysaccharide extraction. It also remains unclear whether the residues have medical value related its traditional clinic function.
   During this work, we firstly identified the contents of the post-extraction residue by UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS and evaluated its in vivo wound healing and in vitro antioxidant activity. The wound healing activity of the ointment containing residue was assessed for 15 days the scald model was used in mice, followed by histopathology and histomorphological analysis. The in vitro antioxidant effect of Bletilla residue was researched using DPPH, ABTS, Hydroxyl radical scavenging, superoxideanion radical scavenging, and reducing power assays. AUPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS analysis identified 6 phenolic compounds: protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3-Hydroxycinnamic acid, and ferulic acid. Animals treated with "mixed ointment" experienced inflammatory infiltration, which was lower than that of other groups. Both "BSPG ointment" and "Bletilla phenolic ointment" demonstrated superior tissue repair compared to the control. This study was the first to confirm that the residual liquid after polysaccharide extraction has excellent antioxidant and wound healing activities. In addition to Bletilla striata polysaccharides, the residual liquid can improve skin regeneration after burns and reduce inflammatory marker levels. These results have implications that the residual liquid has potential wound healing medicinal value. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the preventive effects of Lactobacillus fermentum HY01 (LF-HY01) to dextran sulfate sodium induced-colitis. We observed the ratio of colon weight to its length, colon pathological changes, and the concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors (IFN-gamma, IL-12, TNF alpha, and IL-6) in serum. We also took account of the protein levels of I kappa B alpha, NF-kappa B p65, iNOS, and COX-2, and we measured the best effects of different doses of Lactobacillus fermentum HY01 (low dose group was 10(9) CFU/kg.bw, high dose group was 10(10) CFU/kg.bw) on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice. The results were remarkable, suggesting that Lactobacillus fermentum HY01 had significant preventive effects in dextran sulfate sodium induced-colitis; simultaneously, the high dose group showed the best results among other groups. It can effectively alleviate the shortened colon length, reduce the ratio of colon weight to its length, reduce edema, inflammatory cells infiltration, and colon mucosa injury, and play an important role in the down-regulation of concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors (IFN-gamma, IL-12, TNF alpha, and IL-6). Above all, Lactobacillus fermentum HY01 shows promising prevention for I kappa B alpha degradation, inhibition of NF-kappa B p65 phosphorylation cascades, and decreases the protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 as well.

AB Trait impulsivity is a multifaceted personality characteristic that contributes to maladaptive life outcomes. Although a growing body of neuroimaging studies have investigated the structural correlates of trait impulsivity, the findings remain highly inconsistent and heterogeneous. Herein, we performed a systematic review to depict an integrated delineation of gray matter (GM) substrates of trait impulsivity and a meta-analysis to examine concurrence across previous whole-brain voxel-based morphometry studies. The systematic review summarized the diverse findings in GM morphometry in the past literature, and the quantitative meta-analysis revealed impulsivity-related volumetric GM alterations in prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. In addition, we identified the modulatory effects of age and gender in impulsivity-GM volume associations. The present study advances understanding of brain GM morphometry features underlying trait impulsivity. The findings may have practical implications in the clinical diagnosis of and intervention for impulsivity-related disorders.

AB X-ray irradiation-induced toxicity to gastrointestinal tract become a significant clinical problem when using radiotherapy for treating abdominal tumors neighbored to gastrointestinal tissue, which not only often prevents these tumors from receiving a definitive therapeutic dose but also causes a series of gastrointestinal diseases, such as anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and hematochezia. And thus it seriously reduces the therapeutic outcome and life quality of patients. Therefore, the development of gastrointestinal radioprotectors is essential. However, the commercial gastrointestinal radioprotectors in clinical are still rare. In view of this, we prepared bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified graphdiyne (GDY) nanoparticles (GDY-BSA NPs) and for the first time studied its gastrointestinal radioprotection ability. The unique advantages of GDY nanomaterial, including high free radical scavenging ability, good chemical stability in gastric acid condition, relatively longer residence time in gastrointestinal tract and good biosafety under oral administration, provide the favorable prerequisites for it to be used as the gastrointestinal radioprotector. In vitro experimental results indicated that the GDY-BSA NPs powerfully reduced DNA damage and improved viability of the irradiated gastrointestinal cells. In vivo results showed that the GDY-BSA NPs significantly decrease radiation-induced diarrhea, weight loss, and gastrointestinal tissue pathological damage of mice. Furthermore, we also deeply studied the gastrointestinal radioprotective mechanism of GDY-BSA NPs, which indicated that the GDY-BSA NPs effectively inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced apoptosis signal pathway, and thus reduced gastrointestinal cell apoptosis. Our work for the first time employed BSA-GDY NPs to mitigating radiation-induced gastrointestinal tract damage, which not only promotes the exploration of new gastrointestinal tract radio-protectors, but also is the good guidance for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases by nano-drug.

AB With the wide production and applications of graphene and its derivatives, their toxicity to the environment has received much attention nowadays. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) to white rot fungus (Phanerochaete chrysosporium). GO was prepared by modified Hummers method and well characterized before use. P. chrysosporium was exposed to GO at the concentrations of 0 -4 mgimL for 7 d. The fresh and dry weights, pH values of culture media, structures, ultrastructures, IR spectra and activities of the decomposition of pollutants were measured to reveal the hazards of GO to P. chrysosporium. Our results indicated that low concentrations of GO stimulated the growth of P. chrysosporium. The exposure to GO induced more acidic pH values of the culture media after 7 d. GO induced the disruption of the fiber structure of P. chrysosporium, while at 4 mg/mL some very long and thick fibers were formed. Such changes were reflected in the scanning electron microscopy investigations, where the disruption of fibers was observed. In the ultrastructural investigations, the shape of P. chrysosporium cells changed and more vesicles were found upon the exposure to GO. The infrared spectroscopy analyses suggested that the chemical compositions of mycelia were not changed qualitatively. Beyond the toxicity, GO did not alter the activities of P. chrysosporium at low concentrations, but led to the complete loss of activity at high concentrations. The implication to the ecological safety of graphene is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene sponge (GS) has found applications in oil removal due to the hydrophobic nature of graphene sheets. Current hydrothermal preparations of GS use toxic reducing reagents, which might cause environmental pollution. In this study, we reported that graphene oxide (GO) could be hydrothermally reduced by glucose to form GS for the adsorption of oils and various organic solvents. Graphene sheets were reduced by glucose during the hydrothermal treatment and formed 3D porous structure. GS efficiently adsorbed organic solvents and oils with competitive adsorption capacities. GS was able to treat pollutants in pure liquid form and also in the simulated seawater. GS could be easily regenerated by evaporating or burning. After 10 cycles, the adsorption capacity still retained 77% by evaporating and 87% by burning. The implication to the applications of GS in water remediation is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Leaf water content contributes to global leaf trait relationships

AB Leaf functional traits are increasingly used as proxies for plant functions. Here, the authors show that leaf water affects other leaf traits and is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than leaf nitrogen or phosphorus content.
   Leaf functional traits are important indicators of plant growth and ecosystem dynamics. Despite a wealth of knowledge about leaf trait relationships, a mechanistic understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors quantitatively influence leaf trait variation and scaling is still incomplete. We propose that leaf water content (LWC) inherently affects other leaf traits, although its role has been largely neglected. Here, we present a modification of a previously validated model based on metabolic theory and use an extensive global leaf trait dataset to test it. Analyses show that mass-based photosynthetic capacity and specific leaf area increase nonlinearly with LWC, as predicted by the model. When the effects of temperature and LWC are controlled, the numerical values for the leaf area-mass scaling exponents converge onto 1.0 across plant functional groups, ecosystem types, and latitudinal zones. The data also indicate that leaf water mass is a better predictor of whole-leaf photosynthesis and leaf area than whole-leaf nitrogen and phosphorus masses. Our findings highlight a comprehensive theory that can quantitatively predict some global patterns from the leaf economics spectrum.

TI Giant electrostrictive effect in lead-free barium titanate-based
   ceramics via A-site ion-pairs engineering

AB Electrostrictors offer unique advantages over piezoelectrics, including no poling process, temperature stability and hysteresis-free strain characteristics. Learning from the distinction between disordered and ordered ABI0.5BII0.5O(3) perovskite-structured electrostrictors, the electrostrictive effect enhances with a smaller active space for B ions. Here, we propose a novel design strategy to arouse the potential capacity of electrostriction in BaTiO3-based materials by A-site Li+-Ho3+ ion-pairs engineering. In this way, limited active space for a Ti-site is expected due to the contracted oxygen octahedron around ion-pairs, resulting in smaller polarization per unit magnitude of electric field but a larger strain per unit magnitude of polarization and therefore an enhanced longitudinal electrostrictive coefficient Q(33). A systematic analysis evidenced that Li+ and Ho3+ ions tend to occupy the neighboring Ba-sites in one unit cell of BaTiO3, and directly form Li+-Ho3+ ion-pairs along the [001] direction. Besides, partial fragmented domain patterns induced by local structural heterogeneity due to the involvement of ion-pairs are detected in samples with higher dopants, benefiting suppression of hysteresis in strain curves. Consequently, the (Li, Ho) co-doped BaTiO3 ceramics by A-site engineering exhibit giant Q(33) up to 0.06 m(4) C-2 which is superior to other lead-bearing/free electrostrictive materials, meeting the requirement of a thermal stability (20-150 degrees C) - low hysteresis (<10%) - large strain (0.12-0.2%) combination stimulated by the outstanding electrostrictive effect. Our research provides a new paradigm for designing applicable high-performance electrostrictive materials through A-site engineering. This is expected to benefit a wide range of functional materials.

AB The tide of new energy vehicles and modern semiconductor devices releases a myriad of graphite anode and graphite target wastes. Recycling graphite wastes for catalysis preparation turns out to be a win-win and efficient way to deal with rampant environmental pollution. In this work, a graphite target waste was efficiently recycled into 2D few-layer graphite as the raw materials for the subsequent synthesis of nanoscale photocatalysts. The as-developed photocatalyst demonstrates a gain of 19 % in photocatalytic efficiency and superior photostability in sunlight-driven photodegradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, the impact of temperature and pH value on the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was systematically investigated. The work affords an effective strategy for high-efficiency waste reclamation through full utilization of the graphite target wastes.

Lymphopenia may affect the host adaptive immune responses and impact the clinical course of acute viral infections. Detailed knowledge on how viruses induce lymphopenia would provide valuable information into the pathogenesis of viral infections and potential therapeutic targeting. In this review, the current progress of viruses-induced lymphopenia is summarized and the potential mechanisms and factors involved are discussed.

AB Waste leather, as a high-nitrogen biomass, produced from leather industry aroused wide attention in the light of volume and the environmental problem. High nitrogen activated carbon (HNAC) derived from waste leather as its reusable byproduct was prepared to adsorb various heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Ni, Co) from aqueous solution. Elemental analysis showed that the nitrogen content of HNAC was as high as 5.8%, and six kinds of nitrogen such as pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen was found according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. The maximum adsorption amounts of HNAC for Pb, Cu, Ni, and Co were 231.0, 130.0, 106.0, and 104.66 mg/g, respectively. It has been proved that there were four adsorption mechanisms for HNAC to adsorb multiple heavy metals, and the proportions of various mechanisms have been calculated. Especially, the adsorption selectivity of HNAC to Pb was proved by binary metal reaction system, and the highly efficient adsorption is associated with nitrogen functional groups. Therefore, leather wastes seem to be encouraging to prepare HNAC for heavy metals adsorption without adding amino modification reagents.

AB Magnetic carbon nanomaterials have been widely adopted as adsorbents in water treatment, but the low adsorption capacities largely limit their practical applications. In this study, magnetic graphene sponge (Fe3O4-GS) was prepared by lyophilization for the adsorption of dye pollutant. The incorporation of Fe3O4 enabled the magnetic separation of Fe3O4-GS after the adsorption of methylene blue (MB). The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4-GS for MB was 526 mg/g, much higher than those of the magnetic carbon nanoadsorbents in the literature. The adsorption kinetics of MB on Fe3O4-GS was moderately fast, which could be analyzed by the pseudo-second-order model and intraparticle diffusion model. The thermodynamics study revealed that the adsorption was driven by the increased randomness on the interface. The pH and ionic strength had meaningful influences on the adsorption capacity of Fe3O4-GS. The facile regeneration of Fe3O4-GS would definitely reduce its operating cost. The implications to the environmental applications of magnetic carbon nanoadsorbents are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The alkaline phosphatase-harboring community (the phoD community hereafter) plays an important role in organic P mineralization. Here, we comparatively studied the biogeographical patterns of abundant and rare phoD subcommunities and their roles in mediating soil phosphatase (ALP) activity and available P content in three representative steppe regions in China, namely the Inner Mongolian Plateau, the Loess Plateau, and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated that soil ALP activity, available P content, soil and microbial biomass C:P, N:P ratios varied significantly among steppe regions. Significant differences in diversity, metabolic energy and assembly processes were observed between abundant and rare phoD subcommunities. First, richness of the rare taxa was significantly higher than that of the abundant subcommunities. Second, testing of metabolic theory of ecology showed that rare subcommunities had a higher metabolic activation energy than the abundant taxa. Thirdly, deterministic other than stochastic processes dominated in the community assembly of both subcommunities. Soil pH was the key environmental determinant in community assembly processes for both subcommunities. The relationships among P-cycling parameters and between these parameters and phoD diversity were scale-dependent. The phylogenetic beta diversity of the rare phoD taxa had higher correlations with P-cycling parameters than that with the abundant taxa. More rare than abundant genera were significantly correlated with P limitation and ALP activity at different spatial scales. The rare Frankia was the key genus detecting P limitation, producing ALP and enhancing soil available P in Qinghai-Tibet.

AB As an acidic, ocean colloid polysaccharide, alginate is both a biopolymer and a polyelectrolyte that is considered to be biocompatible, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biodegradable. A significant number of studies have confirmed the potential use of alginate-based platforms as effective vehicles for drug delivery for cancer-targeted treatment. In this review, the focus is on the formation of alginate-based cancer-targeted delivery systems. Specifically, some general chemical and physical properties of alginate and different types of alginate-based delivery systems are discussed, and various kinds of alginate-based carriers are introduced. Finally, recent innovative strategies to functionalize alginate-based vehicles for cancer targeting are described to highlight research towards the optimization of alginate.

AB This paper investigates the issues of extended dissipativity performance and stabilization for T-S fuzzy model (TSFM) based wind power generation systems (WPGSs). Firstly, the stochastic coupled leakage time-varying delays (CLTVDs) and randomly occurring uncertainty parameters (ROUPs) are firstly introduced for constructing more general TSFM. Second, on basis of the time-delay-product function (TDPF) and looped function strategy, a relaxed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with the negative definite term and the time-varying matrix is developed, which can get the utmost out of the information of various communication delays. Third, by utilizing the tighter integral inequalities and reciprocally convex combination technique (RCCT), new stabilization criteria are established in terms of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simultaneously, the desired fuzzy sampled-data control (FSDC) is designed under the state quantization mechanism. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed result. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cobalt (Co) and lithium (Li) were extracted from pure LiCoO2 powders and actual cathode material powders from the spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) after l-ascorbic acid dissolution via a mechanical activation process. The influences of activation time and rotation speed on the leaching were discussed. The mechanism of the improved leaching yield was proposed based on the characterization analysis including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, BET-specific surface area and particle size analyzer. The reduced particle size, increased specific surface area of activated samples, destroyed crystal structure and amorphous state of LiCoO2 contributed to the improved leaching efficiencies of Co and Li. With the activated process, about 99% Co and 100% Li were extracted from actual spent LIBs after 60-min grinding at 500 rpm with mild conditions. This effective process would be of great importance for recovering valuable metals from the spent LIBs at room temperature.

AB The synergistic effects of Lactobacillus plantarum S58 (LP.S58) and hull-less barley beta-glucan (beta-G) on lipid accumulation in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were investigated. The body weight, serum lipid levels and lipid accumulation of adipose and liver tissues in the HFD-fed mice were inhibited after synergistic treatment with LP.S58 and beta-G. In liver and adipose tissues, LP.S58 and beta-G synergistically activated AMPK, reduced the expression of PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, SREBP-1c, FAS, SCD1 and LPL, and increased the expression of CPT-1 and HSL. The HFD-induced decreases in lipid metabolism-related hormones were reversed by LP.S58 and beta-G. LP.S58 and beta-G synergistically also increased the expression of colon tight junction proteins while suppressing systematic inflammation. LP.S58 and beta-G ameliorated gut microbiological dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice. Correlations between serum parameters and gut microbiota were revealed. LP.S58 and beta-G synergistically attenuated the HFD-induced lipid accumulation by activating AMPK signaling and regulating the gut microbiota.

AB There has been increasing interest in identifying factors to predict subjective well-being in the emerging field of positive psychology over the past two decades. Dispositional hope, which reflects one's goal-directed tendencies, including both pathway thinking (planning to meet goals) and agency thinking (goal-directed determination), has emerged as a stable predictor for subjective well-being. However, the neurobiological substrates of dispositional hope and the brain-hope mechanism for predicting subjective well-being remain unclear. Here, we examined these issues in 231 high school graduates within the same grade by estimating cortical gray matter volume (GMV) utilizing a voxel-based morphometry method based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain regression analyses and prediction analyses showed that higher dispositional hope was stably associated with greater GMV in the left supplementary motor area (SMA). Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed that dispositional hope mediated the relation between left SMA volume and subjective well-being. Critically, our results were obtained after adjusting for age, sex, family socioeconomic status and total GMV. Altogether, our study presents novel evidence for the neuroanatomical basis of dispositional hope and suggests an underlying indirect effect of dispositional hope on the link between brain gray matter structure and subjective well-being.

AB The porous microstructure of scaffolds is an essential consideration for tissue engineering, which plays an important role for cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. It is crucial to choose optimum pore sizes of scaffolds for the treatment of various damaged tissues. Therefore, the proper porosity is the significant factor that should be considered when designing tissue scaffolds. Herein, we develop an improved emulsion template method to fabricate gelatin-based scaffolds with controllable pore structure. Gelatin droplets were first prepared by emulsification and then solidified by genipin to prepare gelatin microspheres. The microspheres were used as a template for the fabrication of porous scaffolds, which were gathered and tightened together by dialdehyde amylose. The results showed that emulsification can produce gelatin microspheres with narrow size distribution. The size of gelatin microspheres was easily controlled by adjusting the concentration of gelatin and the speed of mechanical agitation. The gelatin-based scaffolds presented macroporous and interconnected structure. It is interesting that the pore size of scaffolds was directly related to the size of gelatin microspheres, displaying the same trend of change in size. It indicated that the gelatin microspheres can be used as the proper template to fabricate gelatin-based scaffold with a desired pore structure. In addition, the gelatin-based scaffolds possessed good blood compatibility and cytocompatibility. Overall, the gelatin-based scaffolds exhibited great potential in tissue engineering.

AB Aging effect can influence the fractions distribution and mobility of metals after they are added into soil. In this study, incubation and soil column experiments under simulated acid rain condition were conducted to evaluate aging effect on the leaching characteristic of Cu, Zn, and Cd in artificial polluted red paddy soil. Our results showed that aging effect reduced metal contents in exchangeable and HoAc soluble fractions. Power function was the most excellent to describe the variation of exchangeable fraction, while pseudo first- and second-order functions were more successful to describe the leaching characteristic of metals from soil columns. The leaching amount of the metals from the polluted soil only accounted for a small part of their total content in soil, and the leachability of Cu was the weakest. Both the exchangeable and HoAc soluble fraction were available as indicators to evaluate the leachability of metals in red paddy soil. The shorter time the soil was contaminated, the more amounts of metals released from the soil. The reduction of exchangeable fraction caused by aging effect was the main reason for the decrease of metal mobility in soil.

AB Urinary glucose determination using a glucose test strip is simple and convenient in daily self-monitoring of diabetes. However, diabetic patients exhibit acquired impaired color vision (ICV), which results in the inability to discriminate between hues. Even with the assistance of a color chart, it is still not easy for these patients to read the urinary glucose results with the naked eye. In this study, a smartphone camera using an image-based colorimetric detection method was successfully developed for quantitative analysis of urine glucose. A horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide-3,3'5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (HRP-H2O2-TMB) system was optimized for a reliable and gradual color fading process via a glucose oxidase (GOD) catalyzed oxidation reaction. The color changes of the peroxidase-H2O2 enzymatic reactions in the 96-well microplate were captured by a smartphone RGB camera with subsequent detection of red, green, and blue (RGB) intensities decreasing at each image pixel. The highly quantitative relationships between the glucose concentrations and the color characteristic values of the blue channel of the captured images were successfully established. The high accuracy of this method was demonstrated in urine glucose measurements with a linear response over the 0.039 mg mL(-1) to 10.000 mg mL(-1) glucose concentration range and a 0.009 mg mL(-1) detection limit. The method has great potential as a point-of need platform for diabetic patients with defective color vision and features high accuracy and low cost.

AB There is a long-standing interest in exploring the factors related to student achievement. As a newly explored personality trait, grit is defined as a person's tendency to pursue long-term goals with continual perseverance and passion, and grit plays a critical role in student achievement. Increasing evidence has shown that growth mindset, the belief that one's basic abilities are malleable and can be developed through effort, is a potential factor for cultivating grit. However, less is known about the association between grit and the brain and the role of growth mindset in this association. Here, we utilized voxel-based morphometry to examine the neuroanatomical correlates of grit in 231 healthy adolescent students by performing structural magnetic resonance imaging. The whole-brain regression analyses revealed that the regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) negatively predicted grit. In contrast, the rGMV in the right putamen positively predicted grit. Furthermore, mediating analyses suggested that growth mindset served as a mediator in the association between left DLPFC volume and grit. Our results persisted even after controlling for the influences of self-control and delayed gratification. Overall, our study presents novel evidence for the neuroanatomical basis of grit and highlights that growth mindset might play an essential role in cultivating a student's grit level.

AB The carbon nanotube aerogel (CNA) with an ultra-low density, three-dimensional network nanostructure, superior electronic conductivity and large surface area is being widely employed as a catalytic electrode and catalytic support. Impressively, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) assembled with a CNA counter electrode (CE) achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.28%, which exceeded that of the conventional platinum (Pt)-based DSSC (7.20%) under the same conditions. Furthermore, highly dispersed CoS2 nanoparticles endowed with excellent intrinsic catalytic activity were hydrothermally incorporated to form a CNA-supported CoS2 (CNA-CoS2) CE, which was due to the large number of catalytically active sites and sufficient connections between CoS2 and the CNA. The electrocatalytic ability and stability were systematically evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization, which confirmed that the resultant CNA-CoS2 hybrid CE exhibited a remarkably higher electrocatalytic activity toward I-3(-) reduction, and faster ion diffusion and electron transfer than the pure CNA CE. Such cost-effective DSSCs assembled with an optimized CNA-CoS2 CE yielded an enhanced PCE of 8.92%, comparable to that of the cell fabricated with the CNA-Pt hybrid CE reported in our published literature (9.04%). These results indicate that the CNA-CoS2 CE can be considered as a promising candidate for Pt-free CEs used in low-cost and high-performance DSSCs.

AB Cattleyak exhibit equivalent adaptability to harsh environment, as yak and much higher performances than yak. However, male infertility of cattleyak due to spermatogenic arrest greatly restricts their effective utilization in yak breeding. Although much work has been done to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest, there is little information available in regard to the differences in transcriptomic profiling between cattleyak and yak testes. In this work, histologic observation indicated that spermatogonia were the main type of germ cells present in cattleyak testis, whereas all types of germ cells in differentiation were present in yak testis. Transcriptomic profiling identified 2960 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in which 679 were upregulated and 2281 were downregulated in cattleyak. Significantly enriched gene ontology terms comprised a large number of DEGs associated with male infertility of cattleyak. The upregulation of STRA8 and NLRP14 may be associated with the accumulation of undifferentiated spermatogonial cells and serious cellular apoptosis in cattleyak. However, downregulated SPP1, SPIN2B, and PIWIL1 were associated with cell cycle progression and spermatogonial genome integrity, whereas CDKN2C, CYP26A1, OVOLI, GGN, MAK, INSL6, RNF212, TSSKIB, TSSIQ, and TSSK6 were involved in meiosis. Furthermore, scores of genes associated with sperm components were also downregulated in cattleyak. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was involved in the top-listed three significantly enriched pathways, and the downregulation of Wnt3a, PP2A, and TCF/LEF-1 may have contributed to the arrest of spermatogonial differentiation in cattleyak. The data suggest that spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak might occur at the stage of spermatogonial differentiation and get aggravated during meiosis, which results in minimal number of sperms with morphologic abnormalities and structural deficiency lacking fertilization ability.

AB Little is known about how livestock grazing could modify altitudinal trends in seasonal ecosystem respiration (Re) and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). We aim to test the hypotheses that the altitudinal grazing effect on growing-season Re is well correlated with the grazing-induced change of plant biomass, and grazing exclusion tends to reduce the Q(10) of Re along altitudes. We conducted a 7-year altitudinal grazing exclusion experiment across lower and upper limits of alpine meadows (4400-5100 m) on the central Tibetan Plateau. Plant biomass, Re and related environmental factors were observed across fenced and grazed treatments at each of 6 altitudes during the growing seasons of 2012-2013. The stimulations of above- and belowground biomass due to grazing exclusion decreased with increasing altitude, which were positively correlated with the change of Re. The Q(10) of seasonal Re generally increased with increasing altitude, but tended to decrease under grazing exclusion. Soil organic carbon did not have a direct effect on the altitudinal variation of Re. Our data supported the hypotheses, suggesting that plant biomass change could be served as an integrated indicator for spatiotemporal variations of Re. Grazing exclusion might be a promising measure to reduce the temperature sensitivity of Re. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using survey data from China, this paper tests the association between individual self-reported happiness and income inequality. The hypothesized relationship between income inequality and individual happiness is an inverted-U shaped association based on the tunnel effect theory proposed by Hirschman and Rothschild (Q J Econ 87(4):544-566, 1973). Using the Chinese General Social Survey data, we empirically investigate the relationship between income inequality and individual happiness and we find evidence confirming the tunnel effect hypothesis. Specifically, individual happiness increases with inequality when county-level inequality measured by the Gini coefficient is less than 0.405, and decreases with inequality for larger values of the Gini coefficient, where approximately 60 % of the counties in the study have a Gini coefficient larger than 0.405. The inverted U-shaped association exists in both urban and rural China; however, the turning points for urban and rural areas are 0.323 and 0.459, respectively. Between the rich and poor groups, the inverted-U shape relationship exists only in the poor subsample.

AB Advanced oxidation processes (AOP) have been widely applied in water treatment. However, traditional Fenton reactions based on a Fe2+-H2O2 system requires an acidic environment and generates a large amount of Fe3+ ions. Herein, we reported that magnetic Fe3O4 core-SiO2 shell nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs) could be used as a Fenton-like catalyst for the decomposition of H2O2, resulting in the decoloration of methylene blue (MB). Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs had much higher activity than bare Fe3O4 cores, suggesting the coating of SiO2 enhanced the catalytic activity. Most importantly, the best performance of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs was observed at neutral pH values. A higher temperature facilitated the diffusion of MB in solution, and thus, promoted the decoloration efficiency. The radical reaction nature was reflected by the electron spin resonance spectrum and the significant inhibition of the decoloration in the presence of the radical scavenger tertiary butanol. Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs could be magnetically separated and partially regenerated after the decoloration. The implication for the applications of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs in water treatment is discussed.

AB Feature selection facilitates uncertainty disposal and information mining, and it has received widespread research interests. Divergence-based fuzzy rough sets (Div-FRSs), a new kind of fuzzy rough sets, have been applied to feature selection and induced two efficient algorithms, FS-AFS and FS-RFS. Nevertheless, FS-AFS and FS-RFS still have advancement space, because the dependency functions only focus on lower approximation and ignore the uncertainty in upper approximation, which will certainly undermine the algorithmic evaluation effects. To this end, this paper introduces the upper approximation and fuses it with lower approximation via class-specific pattern and Spearman coefficient to construct a new information measurement for metric perfection, called Spearman-based self-information. Relying on this new measurement, a novel feature selection algorithm SPESI is established to improve FS-AFS and FS-RFS. At first, Spearman coefficient is introduced and upper approximation is defined. Second, class-driven precision and roughness are built by incorporating Spearman coefficient-based class-specific weight vectors with class-driven lower and upper approximations. Meanwhile, the granulation monotonicity of newly-defined measurements is also explored. Then, the core measurement Spearman-based self-information is firstly given and its feature significance motivates a feature selection algorithm SPESI with heuristic search. Finally, data experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of SPESI, and a conclusion can be drawn that SPESI outperforms FS-AFS and FS-RFS to acquire better classification performances with fewer feature numbers and less running time.

AB Grassland fire, as an important ecological factor, is quite influential in determining the structural and functional stability of ecosystem. In this work, the fire-induced changes on the vegetation and soil microbial community were studied in alpine meadow. Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and functional diversity was determined by Biolog EcoPlate method. Our results showed that burning caused a significant increase in plant functional group coverage, biomass of grasses, soil bulk density and the ratio of roots to soils. Fire also caused an increase in soil pH and a decrease in total soil nutrient contents and soil moisture. The average well colour development of soil microorganism, the microbial functional diversity and the number of carbon source utilisation were also significantly affected by fire. Total bacteria PLFA, Gram-positive bacteria (G(+)) PLFA, Gram-negative bacteria (G(-)) PLFA and total PLFA of the burnt sites all increased significantly in burnt soil. The BACT/FUNG, SAT/MONO and G(+)/G(-) ratio also appeared to be higher in burnt sites. The total PLFA, G(+) PLFA and G(-) PLFA are closely related to the plant community quantitative characteristics and soil nutrients. The total PLFA, bacteria and G(+) PLFA are significantly correlated with the soil total nutrients and available nutrients. These results suggest that the ability of soil microorganisms to use a single-carbon substrate was increased after a fire event. Grassland fire not only has direct impacts on plant community structure and function but also indirectly alters the soil microbial properties because of fire-induced changes in plant community.

AB The amino-functionalized montmorillonite (NH2-MMT) with different amino content is successfully prepared by adjusting the solvents proportion of anhydrous ethanol and toluene. Then NH2-MMT is incorporated into gelatin to prepare composite edible films using dialdehyde xanthan gum (DXG) as the crosslinking agent. The XRD studies indicate that the amino-functionalization is beneficial for MMT to disperse and exfoliate in gelatin matrix and the incorporation of NH2-MMT can induce gelatin molecules to renature into triple-helix structure. The amino-functionalization of MMT provides active sites for the crosslinking by Schiff's base reaction to produce compact networks among gelatin, NH2-MMT and DXG. Moreover, the increase of amino content of NH2-MMT consequentially improves the crosslinking density of the composite films. Hence, the UV light barrier property, water resistance, mechanical property and thermal stability of the composite films are improved with the addition of NH2-MMT and increase along with the increase of amino content of NH2-MMT. The study demonstrates that NH2-MMT is an ideal filler for gelatin based composite edible films. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile learning technologies and social media tools have not been studied to an exhaustive extent in terms of student engagement and learning outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental research method, the authors randomly selected 101 participants who were divided into three groups. Each group received English teaching assisted by mobile learning technology (Rain Classroom), a social media tool (WeChat) and the traditional multimedia projecting system for one semester. The authors concluded that mobile learning technologies could significantly improve behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional engagements and English learning outcomes compared with social media tools. The traditional teaching tools did not improve behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional engagements and learning outcomes as much as Rain Classroom and WeChat did. Future research could focus on development of serious games to improve student engagement and learning outcomes.

AB Traditional wound dressings and formulations, such as cream, gauze, cotton wool and gel, are disadvantaged by short residence time, poor leakage and air permeability, poor patient compliance, and the minimal preservation in wet environment. This study is purposed to develop new biodegradable, antioxidant, and antimicrobial membranes based on two natural polysaccharides, Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) and chitosan (CS). The developed films were characterized by SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to examine surface morphology and internal structure, while TG analysis was conducted to explore the thermal properties of the films. The physical properties of the films were also improved significantly after the introduction of BSP. The biological activity of developed films was assessed by means of antioxidant and antibacterial assay for the further research as a potential wound dressing. The CCK-8 assay revealed that the developed films showed a significant improvement of cell viability, biocompatibility and non-toxicity. These researches demonstrated that BSP/CS films can be applied as suitable materials for the development of biomaterial matrix in novel wound dressing. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The use of probabilistic uncertain linguistic preference relations (PULPRs) enriches the flexibility of decision makers (DMs) in group decision making (GDM). However, the GDM models under PULPRs are mainly focussed on the consensus reaching process rather than the individual consistent improvement. The goal of this paper is to manage the consistency and consensus in GDM based on PULPRs, and provide a feasible method for minimising the preference information loss by optimisation model. First, according to DMs' psychological preferences (optimistic, pessimistic, and neutral characteristics), we proposed a conversion function to fit uncertain linguistic terms in PULPRs, which may be transformed into probabilistic linguistic preference relations. Second, to preserve as much as possible the original preference information of DMs, a consensus model based on optimisation is established, which not only obtains the acceptable group consensus but also guarantees that the consistency level of individuals is acceptable. Finally, we validated the proposed method through a case study of an investment project selection for central enterprises' poverty alleviation fund. The proposed method provides a new way to deal with GDM problems under PULPRs, and help DMs to reach a certain level of consensus on basis of acceptable consistent level of individuals.

AB Uncontrolled bleeding is an important cause of military and civilian casualties. GO has received more attention in the field of hemostasis. However, pure GO has various limitation in application due to its potential thrombosis, hemolytic and cytotoxicity. Herein, we present a simple, rapid and low-cost method to combine GO and natural polysaccharides by hydrogen bonding to prepare a new material Bletilla striata polysaccharide/graphene oxide composite sponge (BGCS). The BGCS was successfully synthesized and characterized by SEM, IR, RAMAN, XRD and Zeta potential analyzer analysis. The BGCS exhibited favorable biocompatibility. Besides, the porosity of BGCS was higher than 90% and showed good water absorption capacity. The results of whole blood coagulation evaluation showed that the BGCS can promote blood coagulation within 30 s without anticoagulant, showing excellent hemostatic effect. Further coagulation mechanism studies indicated that the surface of the BGCS possessed a high charge (-27.3 +/- 0.9 mV) and showed strong platelet stimulation, the BGCS can also induce red blood cell aggregation, accelerate fibrin formation and accelerate blood coagulation. Therefore, the BGCS can stop bleeding within 50 s in rat-tail amputation models. The BGCS provides a new perspective for the safe application of GO in the field of trauma hemostasis.

AB Ganoderma is a significant source of natural fungal medicines and has been used for the treatment of various diseases for many years. However, the use of Ganoderma in cancer immunotherapy is poorly elucidated. In this study, we have analyzed 2,398 English-language papers and 6,968 Chinese-language papers published between 1987 and 2017 by using bibliometrics. A steady growth in the number of publications was observed before 2004, followed by an exponential increase between 2004 and 2017. The most common category for publications about Ganoderma was "Pharmacology & Pharmacy," in which immunomodulation (25.60%) and cancer treatment (21.40%) were the most popular subcategories. Moreover, we have provided an overview of the bioactive components and combinatorial immunomodulatory effects for the use of Ganoderma in the treatment of cancer, including the major pathways of immune cells. Immunomodulatory protein and polysaccharides are the key bioactive factors responsible for cancer immunotherapy, and the NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways are the most comprehensively investigated major pathways. Our results indicate that Ganoderma has a broad-spectrum application for the treatment of cancer through the regulation of the immune system. This review provides guidance for future research into the role of Ganoderma in cancer immunotherapy.

AB The green hydrogen route provides a reliable way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is an efficient way to convert unstable renewable energy sources into hydrogen energy. Herein, a rod-like N-doped carbon nanorods array cooperated with layered double hydroxide (Ni2Fe@Co-NC/CC) and a tri-metal phosphides composite (P-Ni2Fe@Co-NC/CC) is fabricated, which is believed can facilitate the electron and mass transfer efficiency. The Co element in Ni2Fe@Co-NC/CC can promote the formation of high-valence Ni and activate lattice oxygen to form abundant dual OER active sites. While the P-Ni2Fe@Co-NC/CC can obtain optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy due to synergistic effect of trimetallic phosphides and nitrogen-doped carbon structure to promotes the HER progress. Therefore, due to the synergistic effect between metal hydroxide/phosphide and Co-decorated NC nanorods array, low overpotentials of 240 and 137 mV at 100 mA cm-2 can be achieved for OER and HER with excellent electrocatalytic stability. Besides, the Ni2Fe@Co-NC/CC//PNi2Fe@Co-NC/CC device can afford cell voltage of 1.579 V at 50 mA cm-2 in water splitting, which demonstrate a new idea for rational designed electrocatalytic water splitting composites towards high activity and stability.

AB Exosomes are a subset of nano-sized extracellular vesicles originating from endosomes. Exosomes mediate cell-to-cell communication with their cargos, which includes mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. Exosomal RNAs have cell specificity and reflect the conditions of their donor cells. Notably, their detection in biofluids can be used as a diagnostic marker for various diseases. Exosomal RNAs are ideal biomarkers because their surrounding membranes confer stability and they are detectable in almost all biofluids, which helps to reduce trauma and avoid invasive examinations. However, knowledge of exosomal biomarkers remains scarce. The present review summarizes the biogenesis, secretion, and uptake of exosomes, the current researches exploring exosomal mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of human diseases, as well as recent techniques of exosome isolation.

AB Indium oxide (In2O3) hollow microspheres were prepared using yeast as a bio-template with the aid of a precipitation method. The yeast provided a solid frame for the deposition of In(OH) 3 to form the precursor. The resulting In2O3 hollow microspheres were obtained by calcining the precursor at 650 degrees C. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The results showed that the diameter of the In2O3 hollow microspheres was about 2.0-3.0 mu m and the spherical shells were composed of In2O3 nanoparticles with a size of similar to 20 nm. The BET specific surface area of the sample was 19.23 m(2) g(-1). The photoelectrocatalytic test results showed that the photoelectrocatalytic degradation efficiency of methylene blue (MB) using In2O3 hollow microspheres as catalysts under visible light irradiation and a certain voltage could reach above 95% after 4 hours, much higher than that of only photodegradation. The enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity could be attributed to the hydroxyl radicals HO center dot produced by the light irradiation reaction process which could oxidize the electron donors and were beneficial to reducing the recombination of electrons and holes.

AB Accumulating evidences have suggested the existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), which possess the potential of both self-renewal and differentiation. The origin of BCSCs might have relationship to the development of normal mammary stem cells. BCSCs are believed to play a key role in the initiation, recurrence and chemo-/radiotherapy resistances of breast cancer. Therefore, elimination of BCSCs is crucial for breast cancer therapy. However, conventional chemo and radiation therapies cannot eradicate BCSCs effectively. Fortunately, nanotechnology holds great potential for specific and efficient anti-BCSCs treatment. Smart nanocarriers can distinguish BCSCs from the other breast cancer cells and selectively deliver therapeutic agents to the BCSCs. Emerging findings suggest that BCSCs in breast cancer could be successfully inhibited and even eradicated by functionalized nanomedicines. In this review, we focus on origin of BCSCs, strategies used to target BCSCs, and summarize the nanotechnology-based delivery systems that have been applied for eliminating BCSCs in breast cancer.

The presence of quinone moieties in the PDA MPs rapidly channeled the electrons derived from the electron donor (NaBH4) to the dyes, resulting in increased decolorization of the dyes.

AB The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells is of decisive importance to hold higher energy efficiency. Despite some achievements, their progress, especially electrocatalytic selectivity to complete oxidated C1 products, is remarkably slower than expected. In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir-doped CuPd single-crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir-CuPd SMTs) as high-performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C-C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The synthesis relied on precise reduction/co-nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore-forming surfactant and extra Br- as the facet-selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well-defined (111) facets, single-crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir-CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high-energy-barrier C-C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir-CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.
   Ir-doped CuPd single-crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir-CuPd SMTs) were facilely prepared through an aqueous surfactant-templating epitaxial growth strategy. With mesoporous channels and multi-compositions, Ir-CuPd SMTs delivered remarkable C-C bond cleavage of electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) to C1 products. The Ir-CuPd SMTs performed perfectly in coupled electrocatalysis of EGOR and nitrate reduction. image

AB Utilization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production to alleviate energy problems is a hot topic of research nowadays, thus the design and synthesis of highly efficient g-C3N4 materials remains a significant challenge. Herein, the sulphur-doped hollow porous tubular g-C3N4 (S-HPTCN) was successfully synthesized by a facile environmentally friendly supramolecule self-assembly strategy. Photocatalytic H2 evolution tests show that the as-prepared optimal S-HPTCN achieved a high H2 production of up to 22.04 mmol g-1 h-1 with the turnover frequency (TOF) of 429.7 h-1 and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of as high as 7.8% at wavelength of 420 nm. The enhancement of remarkable photocatalytic H2 perfor-mance is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of morphology and elemental doping. This research provides an effective design idea of developing high-efficient g-C3N4-based material for solar to hydrogen.

AB The ideal solution to the energy shortage problem is to split water into hydrogen (H2) utilizing solar -driven semiconductor photocatalytic technology. Nevertheless, severe carrier recombination is the major cause of decreased activity over photocatalysts. Construction of internal electric field (IEF) by coupling semiconductor with metal co-catalyst can effectively promote carrier separation. Herein, Co@C with the Co encapsulated in the C layer as a co-catalyst anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets via a facile electrostatic self-assembly strategy, achieving outstanding photocatalytic water splitting into H2 under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G) with the production rate of 18.1 mmol h-1 g-1, which is 109.7 times higher than that of bare ZIS without assisted of Pt. Enhancement of photocatalytic H2 evolu-tion activity of Co@C/ZIS is mainly attributed to the construction of giant IEF (4.6-fold higher than ZIS) and suitable environment for hydrogen adsorption and desorption (DGH* ti 0), which endows the follow-ing several advantages: (i) accelerating the migration and separation of photo-generated charges; (ii) improving the hydrogen release kinetics. Our work not only provides a design idea for facile preparation of a high-efficient composite photocatalyst, but also expands the application range of transition metal@ -carbon as a co-catalyst in energy photocatalysis.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB Slow reduction of Fe(III) in iron-mediated Fenton-like systems strongly limits the decomposition of H2O2 to pro-duce hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot). Here, we report that graphene oxide (GO) possesses excellent reactivity to enhance the Fe(III)/H2O2 Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation for degrading chloramphenicol (CAP). EPR analysis and quenching tests reveal that (OH)-O-center dot is the primary oxidant for CAP degradation. The characterization analysis and iron species transformation experiments demonstrate that Fe(III) can combine with the functional groups on the GO surface to form GO-Fe(III) complexes. The chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammogram suggest that GO can donate electrons to Fe(III) via intramolecular electron transfer and promote H2O2 induced Fe(III) reduction by increasing the oxidation capability of Fe(III) due to the formation of GO-Fe(III) complexes, resulting in the strong promotion of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle for producing center dot OH. Moreover, the dark-and vis-GO/Fe(III)/H2O2 systems can effectively degrade CAP at initial pH ranging from 2.0 to 4.7. The reusability and stability of GO were evaluated by performing the cyclic degradation experiments of CAP. The center dot OH induced degradation pathway of CAP was proposed involving three stages, based on intermediates analysis of UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS system. Therefore, the GO/Fe(III)/H2O2 system with or without visible light shows high potential for application in environmental remediation. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Ammonia (NH3) gas is an atmospheric pollutant, produced from different sources. In poultry houses NH3 is produced from the biological process of liter, manure, and protein composition. It has been well documented that NH3 adversely effects the health of chickens. However, the underlying mechanism of NH3 toxicity on chicken thymus is still unknown. Thymus is an important immune organ, which play a critical role in eliciting protective immune responses to ensure healing process and elimination of harmful stimuli. The results showed that NH3 exposure reduced antioxidant activities and induced oxidative stress in thymus tissues. Histological observation showed normal morphology of chicken thymus in control group. In contrast, increased number of nuclear debris, vacuoles, and cristae break were seen in NH3 affected chickens. Ultrastructural analysis indicated mitochondrial breakdown, disappearance, vacuoles, and chromatin condensation in NH3 treated groups. The mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis related genes were significantly enhanced in the chicken thymus of NH3 affected chickens compared to control group. Moreover, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay results suggested that NH3 exposure increased positive stained nuclei in the chicken thymus. Meanwhile, NH3 exposure reduced the number of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, decreased the adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) activities. The mRNA and protein expression of autophagy, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial dynamics proteins were altered by NH3 exposure. In summary, these results showed that NH3 induced oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagic cell death (ACD), which could be the possible causes of immune damage and structural impairment in chicken thymus.

AB Cyclization and polymer conjugation are two commonly used approaches for enhancing the pharmacological properties of protein drugs. However, cyclization of parental proteins often only affords a modest improvement in biochemical or cell-based in vitro assays. Moreover, very few studies have included a systematic pharmacological evaluation of cyclized protein-based therapeutics in live animals. On the other hand, polymer-conjugated proteins have longer circulation half-lives but usually show poor tumor penetration and suboptimal pharmacodynamics due to increased steric hindrance. We herein report the generation of a head-to-tail interferon-poly(alpha-amino acid) macrocycle conjugate circ-P(EG(3)Glu)(20)-IFN by combining the aforementioned two approaches. We then compared the antitumor pharmacological activity of this macrocycle conjugate against its linear counterparts, N-P(EG(3)Glu)(20)-IFN, C-IFN-P(EG(3)Glu)(20), and C-IFN-PEG. Our results found circ-P(EG(3)Glu)(20)-IFN to show considerably greater stability, binding affinity, and in vitro antiproliferative activity toward OVCAR3 cells than the three linear conjugates. More importantly, circ-P(EG(3)Glu)(20)-IFN exhibited longer circulation half-life, remarkably higher tumor retention, and deeper tumor penetration in vivo. As a result, administration of the macrocyclic conjugate could effectively inhibit tumor progression and extend survival in mice bearing established xenograft human OVCAR3 or SKOV3 tumors without causing severe paraneoplastic syndromes. Taken together, our study provided until now the most relevant experimental evidence in strong support of the in vivo benefit of macrocyclization of protein-polymer conjugates and for its application in next-generation therapeutics.

AB Boron nitride/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/carbon (BN/MWCNTs/C) networks were prepared via a rape pollen (RP) biological template assisted strategy. The highly thermally conductive epoxy resin (EP) composites were prepared by impregnating EP into the 3D BN/MWCNTs/C networks. Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses indicated that the successful modification of BN (m-BN) and the interaction between RP, carboxyl functionalized MWCNTs (c-MWCNTs) and m-BN. Scanning electron microscopy images clearly present the network morphology constructed by MWCNTs connected to m-BN. Thermogravimetric analyzer curves determine the mass concentration of m-BN in EP-based composites. The thermal conductivity (K) reached 1.84 W/(m center dot K) in the composites at a BN content of 21.3 wt%, displaying a significant enhancement of 868% compared with pure EP. The enhanced K is attributed to the effective connection of BN by the MWCNTs covered on the surface of RP. Meanwhile, the composites exhibit a tensile strength of 39.2 MPa, electrically insulating with a volume electrical resistivity about 9.17 x 1010 omega cm and good flame retardancy.

AB Changes in precipitation have the potential to cause dramatic changes in ecosystem carbon (C) cycling; however, it remains unclear whether different components of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (e.g., C uptake vs. release, plant vs. microbe respiration, above-ground vs. below-ground plant respiration) have similar or differential sensitivity to precipitation gradients. We conducted a manipulative field experiment (from 2015 to 2017) with six precipitation treatments, including 1/12 annual precipitation (P), 1/4 P, 1/2 P, 3/4 P, P and 5/4 P in an alpine meadow to investigate the responses of the NEE components. Over the 3years, all C fluxes showed a nonlinear response to the precipitation gradients, except for root respiration. The most extreme drought treatment (1/12 P) caused strong reductions in NEE by 15.57%, gross primary productivity by 17.26% and ecosystem respiration by 19.05%, in contrast to the control. Plant respiration was more sensitive to precipitation change than microbe respiration, and above-ground plant respiration was more susceptible than below-ground respiration. Structural equation models revealed that the response of C fluxes under precipitation changes was primarily due to changes in the soil water content and above-ground net primary productivity. Our findings indicate that future precipitation changes, particularly extreme drought, will decrease ecosystem C fluxes with different magnitudes, leading to a consequent reduction of NEE. These emergent ecosystem properties are essential for the improved elucidation of carbon cycle dynamics and benchmarking models, to predict ecosystem responses to precipitation changes.

AB Soil microbes and enzymes play vital roles in the decomposition and transformation of soil material, nutrient cycling, energy flow and physicochemical properties. However, the responses of soil microbes and enzymes to warming remains poorly understood, which limits our ability to predict the consequences of future climate warming. To understand better how climate warming will alter the activity of soil microbes and enzymes, we established a field experiment to manipulate temperature in an alpine meadow in northwestern Sichuan, China. After 5years of experimental warming, soil bacterial communities were assessed by MiSeq sequencing of 16SrRNA gene amplicons. The results showed that the experimental warming treatments increased the soil acid phosphatase, invertase and urease activity, and available nutrients, but decreased the catalase activity and soil organic matter (SOM) at the 0-10-cm soil depth. However, the warming treatment increased catalase activity, SOM, available nitrogen (AN) and available potassium (AK), but decreased invertase activity at the 10-20-cm soil depth. Warming significantly increased the relative abundance of Chloroflexi at the 0-10-cm depth, whereas it significantly increased the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes at the 10-20-cm depth. Similarly, warming altered the relative abundance of bacterial genera, for example Candidatus Solibacter increased, whereas Pseudomonas and Janthinobacterium decreased. Warming did not significantly affect diversity or structure of the soil bacterial community. The soil acid phosphatase and urease activity, and SOM, total potassium (TK), AK and total phosphorus (TP) contents were strongly correlated with the soil bacterial community. Overall, despite the pronounced changes in soil enzyme activity and plant nutrient contents under warming, composition and diversity of the soil bacterial community were not changed. This study helps to elucidate soil responses in grasslands to climate warming.

AB The wide-spread overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to major risks to human health, which demands breakthrough technologies for elimination of antibiotics from water streams. Membrane-based water purification has drawn substantial interest for this purpose. However, high permeance and high antibiotic-removal efficiency remain extremely challenging. In this work, the use of polyphenolbased nanoengineering to functionalize conventional microporous membranes capable of ultrafast removal of ten different antibiotics in an in-line flowthrough purification system is explored. The high adsorption kinetics of these nanocoatings enable a record-high permeance (9,774 L m-2 h-1 bar -1) with exceptional removal rate and efficiency, at a relatively low energy cost (0.09 kWh m-3), even in a real-world wastewater treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights into the role of polyphenol-based nano coatings and their multiple molecular interactions with antibiotics. This work provides a promising and sustainable platform for engineering the next-generation adsorption-based membranes for clean water production.

AB Nanozyme-based tumor collaborative catalytic therapy has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. However, their cooperative outcome remains a great challenge due to the unique characteristics of tumor microenvironment (TME), such as insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, hypoxia, and overexpressed intracellular glutathione (GSH). Methods: Herein, a TME-activated atomic-level engineered PtN4C single-atom nanozyme (PtN4C-SAzyme) is fabricated to induce the ???butterfly effect??? of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through facilitating intracellular H2O2 cycle accumulation and GSH deprivation as well as X-ray deposition for ROS-involving CDT and O2-dependent chemoradiotherapy. Results: In the paradigm, the SAzyme could boost substantial ???OH generation by their admirable peroxidase-like activity as well as X-ray deposition capacity. Simultaneously, O2 self-sufficiency, GSH elimination and elevated Pt2+ release can be achieved through the self-cyclic valence alteration of Pt (IV) and Pt (II) for alleviating tumor hypoxia, overwhelming the anti-oxidation defense effect and overcoming drug-resistance. More importantly, the PtN4C-SAzyme could also convert O2??- into H2O2 by their superior superoxide dismutase-like activity and achieve the sustainable replenishment of endogenous H2O2, and H2O2 can further react with the PtN4C-SAzyme for realizing the cyclic accumulation of ???OH and O2 at tumor site, thereby generating a ???key??? to unlock the multi enzymes-like properties of SAzymes for tumor-specific self-reinforcing CDT and chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions: This work not only provides a promising TME-activated SAzyme-based paradigm with H2O2 self-supplement and O2-evolving capacity for intensive CDT and chemoradiotherapy but also opens new horizons for the construction and tumor catalytic therapy of other SAzymes.

AB Rapid preparing unique carbon-based carriers via simple, low-cost and eco-friendly synthetic strategies benefits for the design of efficient catalysts and their commercial application. In this work, the Fe/C@CNT carrier that the carbon-coated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (iron-carbon heterostructure) uniformly growing on carbon nanotube (CNT) is obtained via the fast pyrolysis (only 3 min) of ferrocene on CNT with efficient microwave thermal effect. The unique heterostructure improves the dispersity and stability of Ni, Ru-based compounds on Fe/C@CNT carrier during the fast preparation progress of Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT catalyst and the subsequent catalytic reaction processes, and promotes the formation of efficient active sites for HER (Ru (0)) and OER (Ni (3 +)). Therefore, Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT shows robust bifunctional activity and enduring stability, and just needs the low overpotential about 32 mV and 246 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, which are better than the Ni-Ru-Fe@CNT using smooth CNT as carrier and even far superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2. More importantly, the whole preparation process of Ni-Ru@Fe/C@CNT is fast, simple and lowcost, providing a facile and environment friendly strategy to rapidly prepare efficient catalysts.

AB Nowadays, the practical applications of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based fluorescence detectors are severely hindered because of the complex synthesis process of linkers or heavy metal contamination. The development of a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly fluorescence sensing system remains a huge challenge. In this study, we designed and synthesized a TPE@gamma-CD-MOF-K complex using the facile in situ encapsulation method. The unique pore structure of gamma-CD-MOF allowed it to effectively include TPE and explosives as guests simultaneously. The TPEp gamma-CD-MOE-K showed stronger fluorescence emission than TPE and sensitive fluorescence quenching activities in response to nitro-aromatic compounds in the liquid phase with detection limits as low as 3 ppm. Furthermore, TPEp gamma-CD-MOE-K can also effectively detect nitro-aromatic compounds in the solid state, which is very convenient for practical detection of explosives. The unique pore structure of gamma-CD-MOF-K and the interaction between K+ and nitro compounds play important roles in solid-state quenching.

AB BackgroundThe Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in meat products, which is positively correlated with meat quality, is an important trait considered by consumers. The regulation of IMF deposition is species specific. However, the IMF-deposition-related mRNA and non-coding RNA and their regulatory network in yak (Bos grunniens) remain unknown. High-throughput sequencing technology provides a powerful approach for analyzing the association between transcriptome-related differences and specific traits in animals. Thus, the whole transcriptomes of yak muscle and adipose tissues were screened and analyzed to elucidate the IMF deposition-related genes. The muscle tissues were used for IMF content measurements.ResultsSignificant differences were observed between the 0.5- and 2.5-year-old yaks. Several mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs were generally expressed in both muscle and adipose tissues. Between the 0.5- and 2.5-year-old yaks, 149 mRNAs, 62 miRNAs, 4 lncRNAs, and 223 circRNAs were differentially expressed in muscle tissue, and 72 mRNAs, 15 miRNAs, 9 lncRNAs, and 211 circRNAs were differentially expressed in adipose tissue. KEGG annotation revelved that these differentially expressed genes were related to pathways that maintain normal biological functions of muscle and adipose tissues. Moreover, 16 mRNAs, 5 miRNAs, 3 lncRNAs, and 5 circRNAs were co-differentially expressed in both types of tissue. We suspected that these co-differentially expressed genes were involved in IMF-deposition in the yak. Additionally, LPL, ACADL, SCD, and FASN, which were previously shown to be associated with the IMF content, were identified in the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network that was constructed on the basis of the IMF deposition-related genes. Three ceRNA subnetworks also revealed that TCONS-00016416 and its target SIRT1 "talk" to each other through the same miR-381-y and miR-208 response elements, whereas TCONS-00061798 and its target PRKCA, and TCONS-00084092 and its target LPL "talk" to each other through miR-122-x and miR-499-y response elements, respectively.ConclusionTaken together, our results reveal the potential mRNA and noncoding RNAs involved in IMF deposition in the yak, providing a useful resource for further research on IMF deposition in this animal species.

AB Purpose: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing concern in the modern society. The current drugs approved by FDA are not very promising. Rhynchophylline (RIN) is a major active tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid stem from traditional Chinese medicine uncaria species, which has potential activities beneficial for the treatment of AD. However, the application of rhynchophylline for AD treatment is restricted by the low water solubility, low concentration in brain tissue and low bioavailability. And there is no study of brain-targeting therapy with RIN. In this work, we prepared rhynchophylline loaded methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolic acid) (mPEG-PLGA) nanoparticles (NPS-RIN), which coupled with Tween 80 (T80) further for brain targeting delivery (T80-NPS-RIN).
   Methods: Preparation and characterization of T80-NPS-RIN were followed by the detection of transportation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) model in vitro, biodistribution and neuroprotective effects of nanoparticles.
   Results: The results indicated T80-NPS-RIN could usefully assist RIN to pass through the BBB to the brain. T80-NPS-RIN treatment regulated the activity of neurons in vitro.
   Conclusion: The presented data confirmed that rhynchophylline encapsulated mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles coated with Tween 80 could across through the BBB and exhibited efficient neuroprotective effects. The T80-NPS-RIN nanoparticles have a chance to be an alternative drug to the therapy of AD.

AB Global climate change models predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts, with uncertain ecological impacts across ecosystems. In particular, it is not clear when extreme droughts will elicit extreme ecological responses. For this study, we employed three complementary approaches to explore the relationships between extreme drought and ecosystem responses. First, we used global data mining to evaluate the relationship between extreme gross primary productivity and extreme precipitation from 1980 to 2013. Second, we conducted a meta-analysis using 132 drought experiments across the globe to assess the response ratios (RRs) of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) to extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. Third, we examined community and ecosystem responses in an alpine meadow to a drought gradient experiment, which included five precipitation treatment levels (1/12 P, 1/4 P, 1/2 P, 3/4 P, and P, where P is the growing season precipitation). This study had three key results. In our historical data mining, we found that extreme droughts elicited extreme ecological responses only 15.1% of the time. The meta-analysis results indicated that there were no significant differences in the RRs of ANPP between the extreme versus non-extreme drought treatments. The drought gradient experiment results revealed that although the four drought treatments were statistically extreme, only the most extreme drought treatment (1/12 P) significantly reduced ANPP over the 3 years. Meanwhile, species richness and asynchrony were significantly reduced under the 1/12 P treatment, which led to a significant reduction in productivity. Synthesis. These results suggest that extreme ecological responses to extreme drought may be less frequent than previously thought. But when they do occur, extreme ecological responses may be driven by plant community changes such as species asynchrony, species loss or species reordering. Our experimental results highlight the key role of community dynamics in determining the resistance of ecosystem productivity to extreme drought, which should be assessed when predicting ecological responses to climate change.

AB Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key components of innate immunity that play significant roles in immune defense against pathogens invasion. Recent frequent outbreaks of the "white spot disease" caused by parasitic infection in farmed Tibetan fishes had resulted in great economic losses. However, to our knowledge, the roles of TLRs in mediating immune response to parasitic infection in Tibetan fishes remain to be determined. Here, we performed data-mining on a widely-farmed Tibetan fish (Gymnocypris przewalskii or Gp) transcriptome to determine the genetic variation and expression pattern of TLRs. We totally obtained 14 GpTLRs and identified 5 with a complete coding sequence. Phylogenetic analysis verified their identities and supported the classification of TLRs into six families as in other vertebrates. The TLR family motifs, such as leucine rich repeat (LRR) and Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain, are conserved in GpTLR1-5. Selective pressure test demonstrated that all known GpTLRs are under purifying selection, except GpTLR4 underwent positive selection. Further, site model analysis suggested that 11 positively selected sites are found in LRR domain of GpTLR4. Three positively selected sites are located on outside surface of TLR4 3D structure, indicating that function of GpTLR4 may be affected. Tissue specific expression analysis showed all GpTLRs are present in gill, head-kidney and spleen but the relative abundance varied among tissues. In response to parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection, 5 GpTLR (GpTLR1, -2, -4, -9 and -20) expressions were induced. Intriguingly, GpTLR4 was significantly up-regulated in gills, while GpTLR19 and GpTLR21 unexpectedly showed no any change. In summary, these results revealed the first genomic resources of TLR family and several parasitic infection responsive TLRs in Tibetan fish. These findings provide key information for future studies aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to pathogen invasion in Tibetan fishes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Advancing the performance of the Cu-catalyzed electrochemical CO(2)reduction reaction (CO2RR) is crucial for its practical applications. Still, the wettable pristine Cu surface often suffers from low exposure to CO2, reducing the Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) and current densities for multi-carbon (C2+) products. Recent studies have proposed that increasing surface availability for CO(2)by cation-exchange ionomers can enhance the C(2+)product formation rates. However, due to the rapid formation and consumption of *CO, such promotion in reaction kinetics can shorten the residence of *CO whose adsorption determines C(2+)selectivity, and thus the resulting C2+FEs remain low. Herein, we discover that the electro-kinetic retardation caused by the strong hydrophobicity of quaternary ammonium group-functionalized polynorbornene ionomers can greatly prolong the *CO residence on Cu. This unconventional electro-kinetic effect is demonstrated by the increased Tafel slopes and the decreased sensitivity of *CO coverage change to potentials. As a result, the strongly hydrophobic Cu electrodes exhibit C(2+)Faradaic efficiencies of approximate to 90?% at a partial current density of 223 mA cm(-2), more than twice of bare or hydrophilic Cu surfaces.

AB Peatland ecosystems are globally important carbon stores. Disturbances, such as drainage and climate drying, act to lower peatland water table depths, consequently enhancing soil carbon release and subsidence rates. Here, we conduct a global meta-analysis to quantify the relationship among water table depth, carbon release and subsidence. We find that the water table decline stimulated heterotrophic, rather than autotrophic, soil respiration, which was associated with an increase in subsidence rate. This relationship held across different climate zones and land uses. We find that 81% of the total annual soil respiration for all drained peatlands was attributable to tropical peatlands drained for agriculture and forestry and temperate peatlands drained for agriculture. Globally, we estimate that, drained peatlands release 645 Mt C yr(-1) (401-1025 Mt C yr(-1)) through soil respiration, equivalent to approximately 5% of global annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of conserving pristine peatlands to help mitigate climate change.
   Heterotrophic soil respiration and subsidence are enhanced by water table decline, with a meta-analysis estimating that soil respiration in drained peatlands across the globe release 645 Mt carbon per year.

AB C-type lectins are a large group of the pattern-recognition proteins, and have been reported to be involved in invertebrate innate immunity, such as cell adhesion, bacterial clearance, phagocytosis, prophenoloxidase activation and encapsulation. Here, a perlucin-like protein (PLP), a typical C-type lectin, was identified from the cDNA library of the shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. LvPLP contains a 540 bp open reading frame, encoding a protein of 179 amino acids that includes a single carbohydrate-recognition domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that LvPLP was clustered into a single group together with other perlucins from molluscs. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that LvPLP was expressed mainly in the hemocytes, hemolymph, heart and gills. The transcription of LvPLP was significantly induced at 9 h by both Gram(-) bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio anguillarum. Meanwhile, recombinant LvPLP (rLvPLP) bound directly to lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan with different affinity. rLvPLP showed a strong ability to bind to Gram(+) (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram- bacteria (V. parahaemolyticus and V. anguillarum), and could induce agglutination of V. parahaemolyticus and V. anguillarum, but not S. aureus and B. subtilis in the presence Ca2+. Further study showed that when LvPLP was knocked down by RNAi, three phagocytosis-related genes (peroxinectin, mas-like protein and dynamin) and four antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes (crustin, ALF1, ALF2 and ALF3) were significantly decreased. Altogether, these results demonstrated that LvPLP played a vital role in L. vannamei immune response towards bacterial challenge by binding and agglutinating bacteria and influencing phagocytosis and AMP expression.

AB This paper addresses the stability problem of delayed nonlinear positive switched systems whose subsystems are all positive. Both discrete-time systems and continuous-time systems are studied. In our analysis, the delays in systems can be unbounded. Two conditions are established to test the local asymptotic stability of the considered systems. The method to compute the domains of attraction is also proposed provided that the system is locally asymptotically stable. When reduced to general nonlinear positive systems, that is, the considered switched system consists of only one mode, an interesting conclusion follows that the proposed nonlinear positive system is locally asymptotically stable for all admissible delays and nonnegative nonlinearities which satisfy an extra condition at the origin, if and only if the system represented by the linear part is asymptotically stable for all admissible delays. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coupling dithionite (DNT) with FeVO4 induced PMS activation (FeVO4/PMS/DNT) effectuates fast heterogeneous Fe(III) reduction to generate multitudinous reactive oxygen species (ROS) for fast degradation of carbamazepine (2.5 mg/L, >90 % degradation efficiency within 300 s) in batch mode. The Fe(III)/Fe(II) circulation propelled by DNT and reduced V species experiences two stages. DNT induces SO2 center dot- generation, which is a highly active species with strong reducibility for Fe and V reduction. The reduced V species donate electrons to equivalent to Fe(III) via Fe-O-V bond rather than directly react with PMS, implying introducing polyvalent V to modulate Fe-based materials intensifies DNT utilization and alleviates ROS quenching effects. Moreover, FeVO4 crystalline form regains after reaction, and FeVO4/PMS/DNT system has an excellent reutilization and strong resistance to natural waters. Our discovery sheds new light on acceleration of heterogenous Fe(III)/Fe(II) circulation to promote Fenton-like oxidation, it may be a long-lasting strategy for water remediation.

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials are star materials with unique structures and properties. To ensure safe production and applications, the toxicity and environmental hazards of MOF materials should be thoroughly investigated. However, the environmental impact of MOF materials on plants is completely unknown. Herein, we reported the toxicity and photosynthetic inhibitory properties of MOF-199 to pea plants (Pisum sativum L.). MOF-199 was synthesized by hydrothermal method. MOF-199 was copper containing double-pyramid of high surface area (668 m(2)/g). MOF-199 accelerated the germination of pea seeds, but the total germination rates were unchanged. MOF-199 inhibited the seedling growth at high concentrations. The net photosynthetic rate increased, while the total photosynthesis capability decreased. Damage to the acceptor side of photosystem II was evidenced by chlorophyll fluorescence. Mechanistically, MOF-199 released Cu2+ in the nutrient solution, led to Cu2+ accumulations in seedlings, and promoted oxidative stress. In addition, the photosynthetic inhibitions of MOF-199 were stronger than equivalent concentrations of Cu(NO3)(2), implying that MOF-199 particles also contributed to the environmental hazards. Our results highlighted the potential threat of MOF materials to plant growth and photosynthesis.

AB We presented an antibiotic-loaded gamma-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework that delivered antibiotics suitable for the treatment of bacterial infections. The gamma-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework was developed using gamma-cyclodextrin and potassium ion via the ultrasonic method. The antibiotic (florfenicol and enrofloxacin) was primarily encapsulated into the pore structures of gamma-CD-MOF, which allowed the sustained release of antibiotics over an extended period of time in vitro and in vivo. Notably, antibiotics-loaded gamma-CD-MOF showed much superior activity against bacteria than free antibiotics (lower MIC value) and displayed better long-lasting activity (longer antibacterial time). The antibiotics-loaded gamma-CD-MOF showed nontoxic and perfect biocompatibility to mammalian cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo. These materials thus represent a novel drug-delivery device suitable for antibiotic therapy. This research is of great significance for reducing the generation of bacterial resistance and providing new ideas for the application of gamma-CD-MOF.

AB Backgroud: Nowadays, biofilms that are generated as a result of antibiotic abuse cause serious threats to global public health. Such films are the primary factor that contributes to the failure of antimicrobial treatment. This is due to the fact that the films prevent antibiotic infiltration, escape from innate immune attacks by phagocytes and consequently generate bacterial resistance. Therefore, exploiting novel antibacterial agents or strategies is extremely urgent.
   Methods: Herein, we report a rational construction of a novel biofilm microenvironment (BME)-responsive antibacterial platform that is based on tungsten (W)-polyoxometalate clusters (POMs) to achieve efficient bactericidal effects.
   Results: On one hand, the acidity and reducibility of a BME could lead to the self-assembly of POMs to produce large aggregates, which favor biofilm accumulation and enhance photothermal conversion under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. On the other hand, reduced POM aggregates with BME-induced photothermal-enhanced efficiency also exhibit surprisingly high peroxidase-like activity in the catalysis of bacterial endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS). This enhances biofilm elimination and favors antibacterial effects. Most importantly, reduced POMs exhibit the optimal peroxidase-like activity in an acidic BME.
   Conclusion: Therefore, in addition to providing a prospective antibacterial agent, intelligent acid/reductive dual-responsive POMs will establish a new representative paradigm for the areas of healthcare with minimal side effects.

AB Little is known about how environmental factors modify spatiotemporal variations of soil respiration (Rs) and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). We conducted an altitudinal experiment across lower and upper limits of alpine meadows on the central TP. Soil respiration and related environmental factors were observed at each of 7 altitudes (from 4400 m to 5200 m) during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. Soil temperature (ST) rather than soil moisture (SM) was the major abiotic factor controlling seasonal variation of Rs in alpine grasslands across the seven altitudes. In addition to ST and SM, plant biomass is also an important factor controlling seasonal trends of Rs. The seasonal mean Rs increased with increasing altitude up to 4950 m, and then decreased above 4950 m. Below-ground biomass (BGB), ST and SM have direct effects on Rs, and the altitudinal trends of Rs can be well-predicated from these three variables (R-2 - 0.65). The Q(10) values of seasonal Rs generally increased with increasing altitude. Alpine meadows generally have higher Q(10) values comparing with steppe meadows. Along the altitude gradient, Q(10) was negatively correlated with ST, but positively correlated with SM, AGB, BGB and SOC. The results suggested that future climate warming would enhance Rs rates more dramatically in high-altitudes grasslands, and changes in vegetation structure under climate change might have a large impact on Rs in these alpine grasslands.

AB Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode material for high energy density Li batteries due to its high specific capacity and low redox potential. However, its practical applications are hindered by issues such as Li dendrites, side reactions, and volumetric changes. Li-rich alloys have demonstrated potential in addressing these issues, as they can be easily synthesized and form an in situ three-dimensional scaffold embedded with metallic Li. This review comprehensively summarizes the properties of representative Li-rich alloys, including binary and multielement alloys. These alloys consist of both metallic and non-metallic elements, some of which can form solid solutions with Li, while others can form intermetallic compounds. The advantages and disadvantages of these alloys are compared and analyzed. Solid solution alloys are more stable than intermetallic compounds because there is no phase transformation within a certain range during the process of lithiation and delithiation. Li-rich alloys, such as Li-Mg, Li-Sn, and Li-Zn, exhibit promising merits, including high specific capacity, stable scaffold, high ionic conductivity, and low cost. This investigation provides a comprehensive perspective for the development of Li-rich alloy anodes towards practical application.

AB Soil microbiota increase their fitness to local habitats by adjusting their life history strategies. Yet, how such adjustments drive their ecological adaptations in xeric grasslands remains elusive. In this study, shifts in the traits that potentially represent microbial life history strategies were studied along two aridity gradients with different climates using metagenomic and trait-based approaches. The results indicated that resource acquisition (e.g., higher activities of beta-d-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosidase, higher degradation rates of cellulose and chitin, as well as genes involved in cell motility, biodegradation, transportation and competition) and growth yield (e.g., higher biomass and respiration) strategies were depleted at higher aridity. However, maintenance of cellular and high growth potential (e.g., higher metabolic quotients and genes related to DNA replication, transcription, translation, central carbon metabolism and biosynthesis) and stress tolerance (e.g., genes involved in DNA damage repair, cation transportation, sporulation and osmolyte biosynthesis) strategies were enriched at higher aridity. This implied that microbiota have lower growth yields but are probably well primed for rapid responses to pulses of rainfall in more arid soils, whereas those in less arid soils may have stronger resource acquisition and growth yield abilities. By integrating a large amount of evidence from taxonomic, metagenomic, genomic and biochemical investigations, this study demonstrates that the ecological adaptations of soil microbiota to aridity made by adjusting and optimizing their life history strategies are universal in xeric grasslands and provides an underlying mechanistic understanding of soil microbial responses to climate changes.

AB Soil microbes play key roles in driving and regulating nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, a lack of global-scale information regarding the distribution of soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB C), nitrogen (SMB N), and phosphorus (SMB P) in terrestrial ecosystems has limited our ability to incorporate the broad-scale soil microbial nutritional properties and the associated processes into biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesized a global dataset including 3801 observations for SMB C, 3154 observations of SMB N, and 2429 observations of SMB P in the top 0-30 cm soil depth. Based on this comprehensive global dataset, we generated quantitative and spatially explicit maps of SMB C, N, and P across terrestrial ecosystems using a random forest approach. We also quantified the relative importance of multiple environmental variables in predicting the spatial variation of SMB C, N, and P concentrations and then made further predictions at a global scale. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was the most important factor in predicting SMB C, N, and P at a global scale. At the global scale, the storage of SMB C, N, and P were estimated to be 23.13 Pg C, 3.93 Pg N and 2.16 Pg P in the top 0-30 cm soil surface, respectively. Our global maps of SMB C, N, and P presented here can be used to constraint Earth system models, and provide the first step forward to predict the roles of soil microbial nutrients in terrestrial nutrient cycling.

AB Improving the CO2 selectivity of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is a crucial research topic right now. Rh could effectively break the C-C bond of ethanol, nevertheless, pristine Rh still exhibit negligible EOR activity due to the poisoning effect of C1 intermediates. To solve it, here we fabricate modified Rh interfaces with highly-dispersive Bi(OH)(3) species as directed by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood Mechanism, the strong interaction be-tween Rh and Bi(OH)(3) could provide the so-called electronic effect and bifunctional effect. Thus it facilitates the C-C bond cleavage at Rh sites and the electrooxidation of as-generated C1 intermediates even at low over-potentials. Eventually, the optimal Rh-Bi(OH)(3) catalysts show an apparent C1 pathway faraday efficiency of 26.2% at 0.67 V vs. RHE, the EOR mass activity of ca. 3500 mA mg(-1 Rh)and 10-hour-long durability. This work could provide an insightful and promising route in promoting the CO2 selectivity of EOR with high activity and long stability.

Through content tailoring, the KNNS-BNZ-0.004BFC ceramic presents enhanced piezoelectric properties via the construction of rhombohedraltetragonal phase boundary near room temperature. Based on the synthesized ceramics, a high-output flexible ultrasound-based wireless energy harvesting device is further designed and manufactured to establish a connection among ceramics and practical application in lead-free KNN-based ceramics. The average ultrasound receiving sensitivity of the fabricated device is calculated to be similar to 1.5 Vpp center dot MPa 1, demonstrating the superior performances. An instantaneous power density of 52.07 mW/cm2 has been obtained from the incident ultrasound pressure of 1.90 MPa. Capacitor charging applications and the feasibility study of ex vivo characterizations under porcine tissue also demonstrate the good application prospect of the harvester. The above results exhibit great potential of the environmentally friendly KNN-based materials to be integrated in the implantable device for safe biomedical applications.

AB Hepatic oxidative stress, as one important mechanism of cadmium (Cd)-induced hepatic toxicity, could, as known, be ameliorated by vitamin E (VE). However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. To investigate whether the antioxidant vitamin E can protect against Cd-induced sub-chronic liver injury associated with oxidative stress and nuclear factor erythrocyte 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, male Sprague-Dawley rats (nine-week-old) were randomly divided into four groups (eight rats/group), namely, control, VE (100 mg/kg VE), Cd (5 mg/kg CdCl2) and VE+Cd (100 mg/kg VE+5 mg/kg CdCl2), and received intragastric administration of Cd and/or VE for four weeks. Cd-exposure alone resulted in reduced liver weight, liver histological alteration and oxidative stress, accumulation of Cd in the liver, elevated ALT and AST concentrations in serum together with decreased mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 pathway related molecules (Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC, GCLM and GST). However, the co-treatment of Cd and VE significantly ameliorated the changes mentioned above, and promoted the expression of genes and proteins of Nrf2 pathway related molecules in comparison to the Cd-exposure alone. Our results indicate that the protective effect of VE against Cd-induced sub-chronic hepatic damage in rats is associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of Nrf2 pathway.

AB The increasing growth and severity of bacterial biofilm infections and the appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria pose alarming threats to public healthcare systems, mainly due to their formidable tolerance to conventional antibiotics. Different from the antibacterial mechanisms of antibiotics, gold nanorods (AuNRs) disinfect microbes by local heating induced by near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation; thus, they are potential disinfection agents. In an attempt to increase the biocompatibility and antibacterial activities of AuNRs against organisms in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, polymethacrylate with pendant carboxyl betaine groups was decorated on AuNRs (PCB-AuNRs) to afford AuNRs with pH-induced surface charge-transformable activities. The zwitterion-modified AuNRs demonstrated a pH-responsive transition from negative charge to positive charge; this confers the AuNRs with a change in functionality from biocompatible zwitterionic nanocomposites in healthy tissues (pH = similar to 7.4) to enhanced antimicrobial cationic nanocomposites at acidic bacterial infection sites (pH = similar to 5.5). AuNRs coated by polymethacrylate with pendant mPEG (PPEGMA-AuNRs) without surface charge transition activities were used for comparison. PCB-AuNRs presented better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) and their drug-resistant strains (MRSA and EBSL E. coli) than PPEGMA-AuNRs as a result of their pH-responsive surface charge transition activities. Moreover, PCB-AuNRs demonstrated deeper penetration into mature biofilms and better biofilm elimination activities than their non-surface charge-transformable counterparts. The results indicate that the designed zwitterion-coated AuNRs are a promising antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections.

AB The potential of using the near-infrared (NIR) and Fourier transform mid-infrared (ATR-FT/MIR) spectroscopy for the determination of intestinal crude protein (CP) digestibility (IPD) of wheat was evaluated. For CP, the best NIR model showed an excellent prediction performance (R-2 = 0.98); the best MIR model also gave an excellent prediction performance (R-2 = 0.96). Regarding to IPD, the best model obtained by NIR technique showed approximate quantitative predictive ability (R-2 = 0.68), and the best model generated by MIR technique obtained similar prediction performance (R-2 = 0.67). NIR models generally showed better predictive abilities than MIR models, which may be due to the MIR spectra record fundamental molecular vibrations and can be more easily affected by multiple interferences. The amide I and II bands played important roles in the development of PLS models for CP and IPD. Results from this study demonstrated the potential of using IR spectroscopy for the prediction of nutrient digestibility while more efforts are required to improve the performance of NIR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy in predicting the IPD of wheat.

AB Dopamine (DA), a simplified mimic of mussel proteins, can be employed as a reductant in the preparation of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) due to its inherent catechol building block. The widely accepted mechanism of AuNP formation using DA as the reductant assumes that the reduction of Au(III) ions involves the two-electron oxidation of DA, where the corresponding phenol and phenolates serve as the reductive species to yield quinone. We herein report a novel insight into the mechanism of formation of AuNPs using DA as the reductant. We demonstrate that the synthesis of AuNPs requires the prior oxidation of the DA to form quinone units, which then catalyze the formation of semiquinones. These semiquinone radicals (SMQs) reduce the Au(III) ions to form the initial AuNPs, and further growth is then catalyzed by the first AuNPs, with nucleation occurring where the SMQs, phenols, and phenolates can serve as reductive species. In addition, DA oxidizes and polymerizes to form a polydopamine capping layer on the AuNPs. We therefore expect that the novel mechanism proposed herein may promote us to furthermore explore the production of noble metal NPs using other polyphenols. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The effects of yak grazing on C and N below-ground pools were evaluated by comparing five grazing excluded sample site pairs (5 years of grazing exclusion) at the Eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), bulk density, pH and soil particle size fractions were analyzed in these samples taken at a depth of 10 cm. Our results showed TK stock and bulk density had increasing trends with grazing activity. pH presented a slight increase, but the differences were not significant. On the contrary, SOC, TSN and TP stocks declined in grazing plots (P < 0.05) and respectively decreased by 32.9%, 27.4%, and 10.5%, while TK stocks increased by 6.8%. P may become limited elements over time owing to an imbalance of inputs and outputs. Elemental stocks calculated by the equivalent mass method indicated the reported SOC losses based on the conventional method might be overestimated and that sampling depth of 7.64 cm rather than same with sampling depth for grazing-excluded site (10 cm) should be applied for grazing site if conventional method is used to calculate carbon stock. The soil silt content in grazing-excluded sites was greater than that in grazed zones (P < 0.05), whilst greater soil specific surface areas were also found in the grazing excluded sites, indicating that manual fencing led to heterogeneous distribution of soil particles and those silts may play a primary role in nutrient stocks in this region.

AB A total of 540 2-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were used in a 35-day experiment and were randomly divided into five treatments: (i) NC (low energy); (ii) PC (high energy diet); (iii) P1 (NC + 0.1% carbohydrases); (iv) P2 (NC + 0.05% emulsifier); and (v) P3 (NC + 0.1% carbohydrases + 0.05% emulsifier). From days 0 to 21, body weight gain in PC and P3 treatments increased (P < 0.05) compared with NC treatment. The chicks fed PC, P1, P2 and P3 improved (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio compared with the NC treatment throughout the whole experiment. Abdominal fat weight was heavier (P < 0.05) in PC, P2 and P3 treatments than in NC and P1 treatments. On day 35, serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration were higher (P < 0.05) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower (P < 0.05) in NC and P2 treatments than in PC, P1 and P3 treatments. The concentration of oleic acid, linoleic acid and total unsaturated fatty acids were highest (P < 0.05) in PC than in the other treatments. In conclusion, the results indicate that low energy density diet had lower growth performance, while the inclusion of emulsifier and carbohydrases in low energy diets can partially improve growth performance.

AB Afforestation has the potential to elevate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, but water erosion would negatively impact such SOC increase. To evaluate the dynamics of SOC and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks in planted forest catchment in a subtropical region with mean annual precipitation of 1398 mm, ranging from 1200 to 1500 mm, we measured the inventories of Cs-137, SOC and TSN in five planted forest stands with slope gradients of 10-30%. Results showed that the afforestation systems have experienced appreciable net erosion, while different tree species exerted distinct effects on water erosion intensity and the stocks of SOC and TSN. Masson pine plantations were most susceptible to erosion with the highest average soil losses of 4.15 +/- 1.25 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Although erosion occurred under afforestation, the soil illustrated large and significant gains of SOC and TSN stocks in the upper 0-10 cm of soil depth (P < 0.05). In contrary, soil in the deposition site had the highest SOC and TSN stocks (P < 0.05) in layers below 10 cm of soil depth. Under Masson pine stands, the lowest accretions of SOC and TSN stocks were observed in the upper 10 cm of soil depth with average gains of 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) and 0.6 Mg N ha(-1), respectively. In the upper 20 cm of soil, C:N ratio was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in forest stands than that in the deposition site. In conclusion, afforestation had a crucial effect on elevating SOC and TSN stocks in the study watershed, but planting of Masson pine is not an optimal choice in terms of soil loss and carbon sequestration. To maximize the net carbon sequestration and effectively control water erosion, terracing or straw mulching in forest plantations should be implemented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Psoriasis is a chronic scaly skin disease, which is associated with abnormal immune system function, inflammatory cell infiltration. The disadvantages of traditional treatment of psoriasis are poor efficacy, recurrence of the condition, long treatment time, and systemic side effects due to a lack of an appropriate drug delivery system. A liposome-in-Microneedles (MNs) based transdermal drug delivery system had been developed to provide efficient site-specific drug delivery, stable drug release and enhanced perme-ability. Firstly, liposomes were loaded with Ginsenoside Rg3 (a small molecular compound with anti-inflammatory and immune regulation functions), then Rg3-liposomes (Rg3-Lipo) were successfully loaded into MNs. Rg3-Liposome-MNs (Rg3-MNs) with the mechanical property of 0.59 N/needle, could easily penetrate the epidermis and release Rg3-lipo to regulate the immune response. The efficacy of Rg3-MNs was evaluated by IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis in mice. Rg3-MNs significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the epidermal thickness, dermal papillary edema, and the possible mechanism was to markedly reduce (p < 0.01) the levels of IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-a. In addition, we found that Rg3-MNs might improve psoriasis by inhibiting the activation of the STAT3/p-STAT3 signaling pathway. In brief, this study provides an ideal loaded anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory drug delivery sys-tem to treat psoriasis. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A new KNN-based lead-free piezoelectric material system of (1-x)K0.4Na0.6Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-x(Bi0.45Sm0.05) Na0.5ZrO3 (abbreviated as KNNS-xBSNZ, 0.00 <= x <= 0.06) is designed to obtain high performance to meet the requirement of next generation electronic devices. The relevant electric properties such as piezoelectricity, strain, and temperature stability are analyzed in detail. An excellent comprehensive property (d(33)similar to 508 pC/N, T-C similar to 268 degrees C) is obtained in ceramic with x = 0.04 through the construction of rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary. In addition, a good temperature stability of strain for KNNS-0.04BSNZ ceramic is also obtained within the range from room temperature to 175 degrees C (S-uni100 degrees C/S-uniRT similar to 97.81%, S-uni150 degrees C/S-uniRT similar to 84.67%), which is comparatively superior to some reported KNN-based ceramics and lead-based ceramics. Therefore, we believe that this new material system would be a promising lead-free candidate for the practical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The characteristics of volatile compounds from five different bacterial species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, growing, respectively, in trypticase soy broth were monitored by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of five pathogens started to increase after the sixth to tenth hour. Methyl ketones and long chain alcohols were representative volatiles for three Gram-negative bacteria. The especially high production of indole was characterized to E. coli O157:H7. The production of 3-hydroxy-2-butanone was indicative of the presence of two Gram-positive bacteria. Both 3-methyl-butanoic acid and 3-methyl-butanal were unique biomarkers for S. aureus. The population dynamics of individual pathogen could be monitored using the accumulation of VOCs correlated with its growth. And these five pathogens could be distinguishable though principle component analysis of 18 volatile metabolites. Moreover, the mixed culture of S. aureus and E. coli O157:H7 was also investigated. The levels of 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methyl-butanoic acid were largely reduced; while the level of indole almost unchanged and correlated with E. coli O157:H7 growth very well. The characteristics of volatiles from the five foodborne pathogens could lay a fundamental basis for further research into pathogen contamination control by detecting volatile signatures of pathogens.

AB Climatic extremes have adverse concurrent and lagged effects on terrestrial carbon cycles. Here, a concurrent effect refers to the occurrence of a latent impact during climate extremes, and a lagged effect appears sometime thereafter. Nevertheless, the uncertainties of these extreme drought effects on net carbon uptake and the recovery processes of vegetation in different Tibetan Plateau (TP) ecosystems are poorly understood. In this study, we calculated the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) based on meteorological datasets with an improved spatial resolution, and we adopted the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model to develop a net primary production (NPP) dataset based on multiple datasets across the TP during 1982-2015. On this basis, we quantised the net reduction in vegetation carbon uptake (NRVCU) on the TP, investigated the spatiotemporal variability of the NPP, NRVCU and SPEI, and analysed the NRVCUs that are caused by the concurrent and lagged effects of extreme drought and the recovery times in different ecosystems. According to our results, the Qaidam Basin and most forest regions possessed a significant trend towards drought during 1982-2015 (withSlopeof SPEI < 0,P< 0.05), and the highest frequency of extreme drought events was principally distributed in the Qaidam Basin, with three to six events. The annual total net reduction in vegetation carbon uptake on the TP experienced a significant downward trend from 1982 to 2015 (-0.0018 +/- 0.0002 PgC year(-1),P< 0.001), which was negatively correlated with annual total precipitation and annual mean temperature (P< 0.05). In spatial scale, the NRVCU decrement was widely spread (approximately 55% of grids) with 17.86% of the area displaying significant declining trends (P< 0.05), and the sharpest declining trend (Slope <= -2) was mainly concentrated in southeastern TP. For the alpine steppe and alpine meadow ecosystems, the concurrent and lagged effects of extreme drought induced a significant difference in NRVCU (P< 0.05), while forests presented the opposite results. The recovery time comparisons from extreme drought suggest that forests require more time (27.62% of grids >= 6 years) to recover their net carbon uptakes compared to grasslands. Therefore, our results emphasise that extreme drought events have stronger lagged effects on forests than on grasslands on the TP. The improved resilience of forests in coping with extreme drought should also be considered in future research.

AB Low-carbon urban development has been regarded as a promising pathway for mitigating climate change, and the transportation sector makes a key contribution to a significant proportion of all CO2 emissions. Investigating the driving factors and analysing the causal mechanism on urban transport CO2 emissions is critical for stakeholders and policy-makers to draft appropriate policies for low-carbon transport, and conducting a comparative study on developed and developing countries' experiences will provide beneficial insights from an evolving perspective. To date, many emerging case studies have analysed urban transport CO2 emissions in China; however, they lack an in-depth decomposition and causal mechanism analyses as well as a comparative study. To fill this gap, this study aims to conduct a decomposition analysis and causal mechanism investigation study on the urban transport sector with comparative studies on two Asian mega cities, Tokyo and Shanghai. We illustrate the driving forces of the urban transport sector and the causal mechanism of each factor and provide critical policy insights through comparative studies. The outcomes of this study provide critical insights to recent practices in Shanghai as well as practical guidance to low-carbon urban planning in developing countries.

AB As a novel fluorescent probe in the second near-infrared window, Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) exhibit great prospect in in vivo imaging due to their maximal penetration depth and negligible background. However, the in vivo behavior and toxicity of Ag2Se QDs still largely remain unknown, which severely hinders their wide-ranging biomedical applications. Herein, we systematically studied the blood clearance, distribution, transformation, excretion, and toxicity of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated Ag2Se QDs in mice after intravenous administration with a high dose of 8 mu mol/kg body weight. QDs are quickly cleared from the blood with a circulation half-life of 0.4 h. QDs mainly accumulate in liver and spleen and are remarkably transformed into Ag and Se within 1 week. Ag is excreted from the body readily through both feces and urine, whereas Se is excreted hardly. The toxicological evaluations demonstrate that there is no overt acute toxicity of Ag2Se QDs to mice. Moreover, in regard to the in vivo stability problem of Ag2Se QDs, the biotransformation and its related metabolism are intensively discussed, and some promising coating means for Ag2Se QDs to avert transformation are proposed as well. Our work lays a solid foundation for safe applications of Ag2Se QDs in bioimaging in the future.

AB The chemiresistor-type sensors based on Ag-ZnO nanostructures have shown excellent sensing properties to NO2 under visible light irradiation, however, they cannot escape from the destiny of the performances degraded by long-term operation. So, aiming at improving the long-term stability, the revelation of the essence of performance degradation is crucial and also a great challenge. Here, we comparatively investigated the change rules of NO2 sensing properties after running the as-fabricated Ag-ZnO nanoparticles-based sensor multiple times during 60 days under UV and visible light irradiation. It is demonstrated that the room temperature light-activated (especially UV light) NO2 sensing performances (response and sensitivity) of the sensor degrade after running multiple times. The degraded performances can be attributed to the deteriorated crystal quality and increased oxygen vacancy defects of the sensing materials, and oxidization of more Ag-0 into Ag+ on the ZnO surfaces, which greatly increase the free charge carrier concentration in the dark and decrease photogenerated charge carrier concentration under light irradiation. Correspondingly, the photoconductivity of the device declines and its output resistance signal weakens. This work offers not only a fundamental understanding of the performance degradation of the light-activated room temperature NO2 gas sensor, but also a strategy for the study on the performance degradation mechanism of other devices.

AB Wheat head detection can estimate various wheat traits, such as density, health, and the presence of wheat head. However, traditional detection methods have a huge array of problems, including low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and poor accuracy. In this paper, a method of wheat-head detection based on a deep neural network is proposed to enhance the speed and accuracy of detection. The YOLOv4 is taken as the basic network. The backbone part in the basic network is enhanced by adding dual spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) networks to improve the ability of feature learning and increase the receptive field of the convolutional network. Multilevel features are obtained by a multipath neck part using a top-down to bottom-up strategy. Finally, YOLOv3 ' s head structures are used to predict the boxes of wheat heads. For training images, some data augmentation technologies are used. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has a significant advantage in accuracy and speed. The mean average precision of our method is 94.5%, and the detection speed is 71 FPS that can achieve the effect of real-time detection.

AB It is of great significance to use safe raw materials, and spontaneously form covalent crosslinking during the fabrication process to obtain active edible films with excellent performance. Herein, l-cysteine as the source of thiol group was firstly conjugated onto gelatin backbone via 1-ethyl-3-(30-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry. Afterwards, the thiol groups in gelatin-l-cysteine (G-Cys) conjugates were oxidized in air to form disulfide bonds, meanwhile the antibacterial polypeptide epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) was incorporated into gelatin matrix to fabricate gelatin/epsilon-polylysine active edible films. The results show that the amount of conjugated l-Cys in G-Cys conjugates ranges from 43.5 to 159.4 mg/g. The disulfide bond crosslinking generated by the oxidation of thiol groups resulted in compact and dense microstructure, which in turn could decrease the moisture content, total soluble matter, water vapor permeability and swelling behavior of gelatin-based edible films, means enhanced water resistance. Moreover, the fabricated gelatin-based edible films showed good mechanical properties, excellent UV light barrier property and effective antioxidant activity. In addition, the incorporated antibacterial polypeptide epsilon-PL endowed gelatin-based edible films with robust antibacterial activity. Overall, the disulfide bond crosslinked gelatin-based edible films incorporated with epsilon-PL could find potential application in the food and drug packaging fields.

AB Water erosion can significantly alter soil physicochemical properties. However, little is known about soil microbial responses to erosion-induced soil physicochemical properties changes in the hilly red soil region of southern China. This research was conducted to determine the impact of water erosion on soil biological properties and the relationships between microbial community compositions and physicochemical parameters. Soil samples of the 0-10 cm layer in one fallow depositional site and five erosional sites (including a Pinus massoniana Lamb. site, Elaeocarpus decipiens Hemsl. site, Michelia maudiae Dunn site, Cinnamomum bodinieri Levl. site and Lagerstroemia indica Linn. site) were collected. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of 165 rDNA were generated to describe the influence of soil erosion on bacterial communities. The results showed that the depositional site had greater microbial biomass and enzyme activities compared to most erosional sites. Redundancy analysis suggested that all physico-chemical parameters together accounted for 79.6% of the variation in bacterial community (P < 0.05). Among these parameters, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a predominant effect on the variation (193%; P < 0.05), while soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen individually contributed to only 3% and 2.5% of the variance in bacterial community, respectively (P > 0.05). These results indicated that soil deposition is beneficial to enhance soil microbial biomass, while soil erosion is in reverse. DOC is a more important factor influencing soil biological characteristics in comparison to other measured physicochemical parameters. Relative to the quantity of SOC, the quality of C is more important in influencing soil biological properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Rational design of the pore structure and surface heteroatoms modification of the carbonaceous-based electrodes is essential for high performance energy storage. Herein, a N, S co-doped porous carbon nanotubes with hierarchically hollowed and trunk-branched nanotube structure based on polypyrrole was fabricated via simple soft template polymerization and activation. The 3D interconnected structure with uniformly distributed active sites can form intimate contact interface and interconnected channels, thus facilitate the electron transfer and electrolyte infiltration. Therefore, the N, S co-doped branched carbon reveals a large specific capacitance (420.6 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1)), good rate capability (287.2 F g(-1) at 30 A g(-1)) and superior cyclic stability (99.32% capacitance retained after 12000 cycles) in supercapacitor. Moreover, this N, S co-doped branched carbon nanotubes also exhibits a high specific capacity (905 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)) and rate capability (461 mAh g(-1) at 12.8 A g(-1)) as LIBs anode. Additionally, full LIBs battery configured by aNSC-2.5//LiFePO4 can achieve an energy density of 2112 W h kg(anode)(-1) (424 W h kg(cathode)(-1)). This simple, well-controlled and easy-scalable porous carbon fabrication strategy can be applied in the many practical fields.

AB Converting solar energy into hydrogen production is a promising approach to tackle the energy crisis. However, developing excellent photocatalytic materials with properties of positive visible light response, high efficiency and photostability remain a great challenge. Herein, we developed a one-photon excitation path system by coupling 3D ZnIn2S4 micro-flowers with 0D CoS2 nanoparticles for hydrogen evolution, with an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 22.24 mmol h-1 g-1. The systematic characterizations and DFT calculations disclose that the improved performance is ascribed to the construction of 0D/3D with multi-reflection and exposed reaction sites, as well as the incorporation of CoS2 and ZIS via a one-photon excitation pathway, achieving the acceleration of photoinduced charge separation and transfer. This work shed light on the design of 0D/3D photocatalysts with high hydrogen evolution performance via a one-photon excitation pathway.

AB Enterprises are essential to the realization of sustainable development in human society. However, there is still a lack of simulation models that can dynamically explain, predict and evaluate the complexity of enterprise sustainable development. Therefore, this paper adopts the method of system dynamics to construct a low-carbon sustainable development level model of enterprise. The four indicators of low-carbon economic benefits, lowcarbon technology stock, low-carbon human resources, and CO2 emissions reflect the level of low-carbon sustainable development of enterprises. The results show that the level of low-carbon sustainable development of enterprises is not high (<0.6); low-carbon human resources have two stages of decline and rise; government supervision and low-carbon technology can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. However, multi-scenario simulation results show that in the early stage of low-carbon sustainable development of enterprise, excessive government supervision will reduce the low-carbon economic benefits of enterprise. Within 10 years, policy supervision can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 67% and increase low-carbon benefits by 17%; low-carbon technology can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 60% and increase low-carbon benefits 33%. The government and enterprises should formulate appropriate policies and strategies based on the level of low-carbon sustainable development of enterprises.

AB In this study, the purification and characterization of a novel polysaccharide-based bioflocculant BM2 produced by a bacterium Bacillus megaterium strain PL8 with self-flocculating property were investigated. The results showed that BM2 was an acidic polysaccharide composed of Gal, GalUA, Glc, GlcUA and Man at a molar ratio of 45.1: 33.8:9.3:9.2:2.4, respectively. The molecular weight of BM2 was 4.55 x 10(6) Da. BM2 had high flocculation efficiencies across a wide pH ranged from 4 to 11 and a wide temperature ranged from 20 to 100 degrees C towards kaolin clay. BM2 was a cation-independent bioflocculant which could achieve high flocculation activity without the addition of other cations. Adsorption bridging was the main mechanism in the flocculation process of BM2 towards kaolin clay. The BM2 also displayed a high removal efficiency in terms of Congo red (88.14%) and Pb2+ ions (82.64%). These results suggested that BM2 had a great potential as an efficient bioflocculant candidate in wastewater treatment. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global nitrogen (N) deposition generally reduces ecosystem stability. However, less is known about the responses of ecosystem stability and its driving mechanisms under different N addition gradients. We conducted a four-year N addition experiment in an alpine meadow, using six levels of N addition rates (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 g N m(-2) year(-1)) to examine the effects of N addition on plant community biomass stability and the underlying mechanisms. We found that the stability of ecosystem aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) decreased linearly with increasing N addition rates, even though it had no effect on plant species richness at low N addition rates and significantly reduced species richness at high N addition rates. The most remarkable finding is that the main mechanism underlying ecosystem stability shifted with N addition rates. The decrease of common species stability contributed most to the reduction of plant community biomass stability under low N addition rates (N0-N4), whereas the decrease of species asynchrony contributed most to the reducing plant community biomass stability under high N addition rates (N8-N32). Our results indicate that species diversity was not a significant predictor of plant community biomass stability in this alpine meadow, which challenges the traditional knowledge. This study highlights the shifts of main mechanism regulating plant community biomass stability under different N addition rates, and suggests that continuous nitrogen deposition in the future may reduce ecosystem stability and potentially impeding the sustainable provision of ecosystem functions and services.

AB With the rapid proliferation of wireless services, the frequency spectrum has become increasingly crowded, and the interferences and composite signals will be ubiquitous in the wireless receiver. For deeply dissecting and detecting the expected signals, the research community has to investigate the smart signal processing technology to resisting the influence of detrimental signals. For this purpose, blind source separation has been shown to be a promising method for achieving simultaneous spectrum utilization and wireless adaptive interference cancellation. The attractive features and appealing advantages of blind source separation make it an attractive theory for source extraction or recovery, which plays a crucial role in helping realize intelligent signal processing for wireless communication. It can recover the unobserved sources only from the wireless received mixed signals based on the features of the source signal exempted from channel estimation and synchronization manipulation. Wireless communication systems can benefit the high spectrum efficiency, strong anti-interference, and adaptive signal processing through the blind separation mechanism. So far, numerous researchers have made tremendous efforts to investigate this field for enhancing spectrum efficiency, anti-interference ability, and signal detection performance through employing the philosophy of blind separation. These meaningful and appealing research works motivate us to make a comprehensive survey with regard to this area. In this paper, the fundamental principle of the blind separation mechanism, involving independent component analysis, sparse component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and bounded component analysis will be reviewed briefly, and then, the critical technologies applied in various wireless communication systems will be overviewed, such as in direct-sequence code division multiplexing access, frequency hopping, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, multiple input multiple output, wireless sensor networks, cognitive radio networks, radio frequency identification devices, and communication security. In addition, the important research challenges and meaningful research directions pertaining to the area of blind separation applied in wireless communications systems are also discussed.

AB Practical, efficient synthesis of metal oxide nanocrystals with good crystallinity and high specific surface area by a modified polymer-network gel method is demonstrated, taking ZnO nanocrystals as an example. A novel stepwise heat treatment yields significant improvement in crystal quality. Such nanophase materials can effectively degrade common organic dyes under solar radiation and can perform very well in photo-assisted detection of NO2 gas. Other typical metal oxide nanocrystals with good crystallinity and high specific surface area were also synthesized successfully under similar conditions. This work provides a general strategy for the synthesis of metal oxide nanocrystals, balancing the crystallinity and specific surface area.

AB In response to the potential water conflict caused by climate change and increased population, an integrated water yield analysis from the perspective of the coupled human-natural system is clearly required. This paper conducted an integrated water yield analysis in the Yellow River basin (YRB), China, with applications for irrigated cropland water modeling and many field, statistical and satellite images. We found the following during 2000-2017: (1) The irrigation water consumption, rain-fed water consumption of cropland and rain-fed water consumption of natural ecosystems all increased significantly. (2) Ecological restoration caused a consequence of the 81.7 10(8) m(3) water consumption transfer from cropland to natural ecosystems. (3) Water consumption variability was strongly related to irrigation expansion and ecological restoration, and this variability dominated the high water yield variability in the midstream YRB (95.73% +/- 0.5%). (4) The increased downstream human water use stress was mainly affected by increased downstream water use and upstream water yield change, with contribution ratios of 1.67 and -0.72, respectively. The study declares the intense relationship between ecological restoration, crop production and socioeconomic activities within the water-limited river basin. This research also highlights that synthetic river basin management is essential to balance the water demand between different sectors and between the upper stream and downstream sections of a basin.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) shocked the world with its unprecedented ability and raised significant tensions in the education field. Educators inevitably transition to an educational future that embraces GAI rather than shuns it. Understanding the mechanism between students interacting with GAI tools and their achievement is important for educators and schools, but relevant empirical evidence is relatively lacking. Due to the characteristics of personalization and real-time interactivity of GAI tools, we propose that the students-GAI interaction would affect their learning achievement through serial mediators of self-efficacy and cognitive engagement. Based on questionnaire surveys that include 389 participants as the objective, this study finds that: (1) in total, there is a significantly positive relationship between student-GAI interaction and learning achievement. (2) This positive relationship is mediated by self-efficacy, with a significant mediation effect value of 0.015. (3) Cognitive engagement also acts as a mediator in the mechanism between the student-GAI interaction and learning achievement, evidenced by a significant and relatively strong mediating effect value of 0.046. (4) Self-efficacy and cognitive engagement in series mediate this positive association, with a serial mediating effect value of 0.011, which is relatively small in comparison but also shows significance. In addition, the propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to alleviate self-selection bias, reinforcing the validity of the results. The findings offer empirical evidence for the incorporation of GAI in teaching and learning.

AB Food security is an important global public health issue, which will not only endanger consumers' life and health, but also cause serious food waste. Herein, antibacterial dialdehyde sodium alginate/epsilon-polylysine microspheres (DSA-PL MPs) were developed to effectively prolong the shelf life of fruit. DSA was prepared by periodate oxidation of sodium alginate. Then the PL was conjugated onto DSA backbone via the Schiff's base reaction to synthesize DSA-PL conjugates, followed by the emulsification and Ca2+ ions crosslinking to obtain DSA-PL MPs. The results indicate that DSA-PL MPs show smooth spherical particle, relatively narrow size distribution and good dispersity. In vitro degradation rate of DSA-PL MPs is higher in acetate buffer (pH = 5.0) than that in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4), showing acid-sensitive degradation property. Significantly, DSA-PL MPs possess strong broadspectrum antibacterial activity, which can effectively extend the shelf life of fruit. Overall, DSA-PL MPs possess promising application as antibacterial agents for fruit preservation.

AB Post-Partum Depression (PPD) is the most common health issue impacting emotional well being in women and is often comorbid with anxiety (PPD-A). Previous studies have shown that adequate social support can protect against PPD and PPD-A. However, how the brain connectome is disrupted in PPD and PPD-A and the neural basis underlying the role of social support in PPD and PPD-A remains unclear. The present study aims to explore these issues in patients with PPD and PPD-A. Well-established questionnaires and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) were performed in 45 PPD, 31 PDD-A patients and 62 Healthy Postnatal Women (HPW). Brain functional integration was measured by analysis of Functional Connectivity Strength (FCS). Association and mediation analyses were performed to investigate relationships between FCS, PPD and PPD-A symptoms and social support. PPD patients showed specifically higher FCS in right parahippocampus, whereas PPD-A patients showed specifically higher FCS in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In all postpartum women, depression symptoms positively correlated with FCS in left paracentral lobule; depression and anxiety symptoms were negatively correlated with FCS in right cerebellem posterior lobe (CPL), a brain region implicated in supporting social cognition and regulation of emotion. Subsequent mediation analysis revealed that perceived social support mediated the association between right CPL FCS and PPD and PPD-A symptoms. Measurement of FCS in disorder-specific neural circuits offers a potential biomarker to study and measure the efficacy of social support for PPD and PPD-A.

AB Estimating terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) accurately at various temporal and spatial scales is crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle and water resource management. The currently available ET estimates have some uncertainties and need to be further improved. In this study, six machine learning methods including the random forests, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression (GPR), ensemble trees, general regression neural network, and Bayesian Model Averaging, are applied and evaluated to improve China terrestrial ET estimation by integrating five process-based ET algorithms including SEMI-PM, RS-PM, RRS-PM, MOD16, and PMLv2. Then evaluations are conducted with the eddy covariance flux observations at 14 China flux tower sites distributing in forest, shrub, wetland, grassland, and cropland, as well as with water balance-based ET at basin scale. According to the multiple training, validation, and testing, the GPR method is superior to all the other methods. Compared with the individual algorithms, the GPR method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.45 mm day(-1) (for SEMI-PM) similar to 0.81 mm day(-1) (for PMLv2), improve the coefficient of determination (R-2) by 0.061 (for PMLv2) similar to 0.33 (for MOD16), and decrease the absolute relative percent error (RPE) by 8.32% (for RS-PM) similar to 42.47% (for PMLv2) for all the test data. At basin scale, the results demonstrate that the annual GPR-merged China terrestrial ET is reliable (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 57.18 mm year RPE = -0.26%) and has higher accuracy than the currently available eight high-resolution ET products and the estimates from the other five machine learning methods and the five single ET models. The annual average terrestrial ET across China for 2000-2018 estimated by the GPR method is approximately 397.65 mm year More ground-based observations of terrestrial ET covering various land types should be collected to update the integrating methods and improve ET estimates. The resultant China terrestrial ET product with a spatial and temporal resolution of 1 km and 10 days (ChinaET 1 km 10days) produced by the GPR method is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.fighare.12278684.v5.

AB Efficient, flexible and self-healing electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are highly desirable and valuable for electromagnetic shielding industry. Furthermore, in order to achieve a commercial-grade EMI shielding effectiveness, a large amount of filler is required. Here, a kind of self-healing EMI shielding fabric was fabricated by preparing aligned carbon nanotube-poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (CNT-PHEMA) non-woven fabric through magnetic-field-assisted electrospinning and cross-stacking aligned fabric layers. The unique aligned CNT stacking and porous structure enable that the materials can effectively absorbing EMI even at very low CNT loading amount (0.17 wt%). The host-guest interaction between beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and adamantane (Ad) moieties not only made the fabric can adhere together automatically but also self-heal the scratch under 100% humidity environment. After the healing, the EMI shielding property can be restored 90.86 +/- 3.90%. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The flexible graphene fiber-based symmetic supercapacitors are usually greatly expected to power small wearable electronics because of their many potential applications. In the present work, the organic electrochemically active material of quinone for asymmetric supercapacitors has been introduced to decorate graphene oxide nanosheets as negative electrodes via a facile hydrothermal self-assembly method. Fortunately, 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) is a suitable choice for functionalizing graphene-based materials through noncovalent interactions. Different from conventional quinone based materials, we study naphthoquinone modified electrode materials with satisfactory electrochemical properties, and take the lead in preparing fibrous quinone based electrodes, which are applied to the construction of wearable flexible supercapacitors. As a consequence, the modified NQrGO/CF exhibits an improved capacitance owing to the superposition of capacitance behavior and the synergistic effect of each component. More interestingly, the all-solid asymmetric flexible micro-supercapacitor (AFSC) assembled with NQrGO/CF as the negative electrode, nickel-cobalt hydroxide hybrid graphene-based fiber (NCHrGO/CF) as the positive electrode and PVA/KOH as the gel electrolyte, which has a potential window of 2.0 V, with a maximum energy density of 50.7 Wh kg(-1). Moreover, we propose the multiple microsupercapacitors could be reasonably connected in series or in parallel for the reduction of resistance and the promotion of electrochemical performance to meet the requirements of specific operating voltage and energy output in application. The graphene-based fiber electrode modified with quinone provides more methods and better options for the construction and development of asymmetric flexible micro-supercapacitors.

AB Sediment dredging is a controversial technology for lake eutrophication control. A lengthy and holistic assessment is important to understand the effects of a dredging project on a lake ecosystem. In this study, a dredging project was followed for 5 years. To understand the variations of lake ecosystems before, during and after the project, water quality, phytoplankton, zooplanklon and benthic animal biomass were monitored; Four subindicators, including eco-exergy (Ex), structural eco-exergy (Ex(st)), buffer capacity of total phosphorus for phytoplankton (beta((TP)(phyto))) and trophic level index (TLI) were calculated and developed to an integrated ecosystem health indicator (EHI). The monitoring results showed that the dredging project caused many short-term positive effects such as decreased total nitrogen, total phosphorus, permanganate index and phytoplankton biomass throughout the entire lake water, increased Secchi disk depth in the whole lake and increased benthonic animal biomass in the nondredged regions. However, these positive effects disappeared overtime. Water chemistry and biomass returned to the initial state before dredging. EHI showed that the dredging project caused negative effects on the lake health in the dredged region at first. Subsequently, the health status of the entire lake, including the dredged and nondredged regions, improved until 1-2 years after the project finished. Because of the lack of other timely ecological restoration measures, the lake gradually returned to its initial health status. However, the health status in the dredged regions was only slightly better than before dredging and often worse than that of the nondredged regions. Our study suggested that dredging projects may only cause short-term positive effects on lake ecosystem health. The external interception and dredging ratio were important. A dredging project should be combined with other ecological lake restoration measures when the project has caused positive effects in a lake. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose: Polygonum orientate L. (family: Polygonaceae), named Hongcao in China, has effects of dispelling wind and dampness, promoting blood circulation, and relieving pain. Our group has already studied and confirmed that POEa and POEe (ethyl acetate and ethyl ether extract of P. orientate, respectively) had anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in early research, which was mainly relevant to the existence of flavonoids. According to the clinical application of P. orientate in traditional Chinese medicine, it has long been used for rheumatic arthralgia and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, our group further explored whether flavonoids of P. orientate have anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect and how does they play this role.
   Methods: Dried small pieces of the stems and leaves of P. orientale were decocted with water and partitioned successively to obtain POEa and POEe, respectively. The anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect of P. orientate was studied by using a Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritis (AIA) in a rat model. The levels of PGE2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in serum of AIA rats were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to explore its mechanisms. In addition, we computationally studied the relationships between the 15 chemical components of POEa and POEe, and the currently focused 9 target proteins of rheumatoid arthritis by molecular docking.
   Results: Pharmacological experiments showed that POEa and POEe significantly ameliorate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis via reducing paw swelling volume, arthritis score, and thymus and spleen indices, as well as increasing body weight in AIA rats. Simultaneously, the concentrations of PGE2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta were significantly decreased by POEa and POEe. Histopathology revealed noticeable reduction in bone and cartilage, synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage surface erosion, and joint degeneration by POEa and POEe treatment. In addition, the molecular docking studies showed that docking scores of 14 chemical compositions (including 12 flavonoids and 2 phenolic acids) of POEa and POEe with anti-rheumatoid arthritis protein targets were better than the complexed ligands of the anti-rheumatoid arthritis protein targets. Among them, six flavonoids in POEa and POEe had more docking protein targets (n >= 3). Five anti-rheumatoid arthritis targets including high-temperature requirement A1 protease (HtrA1), janus kinase 1 (JAK1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) had better docking score compared with the complexed ligands. Moreover, most of the chemical components in POEa and POEe showed strong interaction with HtrA1.
   Conclusions: The flavonoids of P. orientate have anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect. In addition, the molecular docking results indicate that quercetin, catechol, orientin, and other six flavonoids may be closely related to HtrA1, JAK1, COX-2, i-NOS, and PGE2 protein target receptors. It suggests that these chemical compositions form strong protein-ligand complexes with these protein targets, especially HtrA1 to exert anti-rheumatoid arthritis. Further experimental studies show that mechanisms of anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects may also be relevant to inhibit the levels of PGE2, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in serum. Therefore, our group can further explore the possible active ingredients and mechanisms of the anti-rheumatoid arthritis effects of flavonoids, and focus on the inhibition of the expression of inflammatory factors and the TGF-beta 1/Smad signaling pathway associated with HtrAl protein target receptors, which can provide a direction and powerful reference for the action mechanism and drug research of anti-rheumatoid arthritis of flavonoids in P. orientale.

AB Inspired by mussel-adhesion phenomena in nature, a simple, mild surface modification process was elaborated to endow the polyurethane (PU) substrate with antibacterial/antifouling properties. In the present study, polydopamine was coated directly onto polyurethane surfaces. AgNO3 was then added and absorbed onto the surface by the active catechol and amine groups of the polydopamine coating. Meanwhile, the adsorbed Ag+ ions were reduced in situ into metallic silver nanoparticles by the bridge of the polydopamine coating which yielded a coating with good antimicrobial properties. Finally, 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecanethiol (CF3(CF2)(7)CH2CH2SH, F-SH) was attached on the PDA coating via the Michael addition reaction. The hydrophobic F-SH layer above the antibacterial layer yielded a surface with excellent antifouling properties. Preliminary antibacterial assays indicate that the coated surfaces show enhanced antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). Platelet adhesion was significantly reduced for the F-SH-coated PU film. These results suggest that the modified PU could be used as an antibacterial material for future biomedical applications.

AB Solar-driven desalination and purification offers a promising approach to water treatment, while the clean water yields under natural sunlight can be further increased by developing well-designed evaporators. Herein, a TiN/ GO//GO Janus film was fabricated to realize the synergetic effect of effective photothermal conversion and water transportation. The top TiN/GO hybrid layer possesses high solar absorption and thermal conversion efficiency, while the bottom GO layer promotes expeditious water transport. Moreover, the film maintains gradient inter-facial hydrophilicity due to the reservation of oxygen-functional groups, which facilitate the formation of thin liquid film at water-film interface and increase heat utilization efficiency. Therefore, the Janus film is demon-strated to possess high evaporation rate of 1.70 kg m- 2 h-1 for various non-conventional water resources under 1 solar illumination, which is comparable or better than most of the film evaporators. The excellent durability is demonstrated in a wide acid-base range (pH 2-11) and salinity range (0-250 & PTSTHOUSND;) over 30 cycles. The outdoor device with Janus film exhibits daily water yield of 7.44 kg m- 2, indicating a potential application in efficient solar-driven desalination and non-conventional water treatment.

AB Background: Exposure to zearalenone (ZEN, a widespread Fusarium mycotoxin) causes reproductive toxicity and immunotoxicity in farm animals, and it then poses potential threats to human health through the food chain. A systematic understanding of underlying mechanisms on mycotoxin-induced toxicity is necessary for overcoming potential threats to farm animals and humans. The gastrointestinal tract is a first-line defense against harmful mycotoxins; however, it remains unknown whether mycotoxin (e.g., ZEN)-induced toxicity on the reproductive-immune axis is linked to altered gut microbial metabolites. In this study, using pigs (during the three phases) as an important large animal model, we investigated whether ZEN-induced toxicity on immune defense in the reproductive-immune axis was involved in altered gut microbial-derived metabolites. Moreover, we observed whether the regulation of gut microbial-derived metabolites through engineering ZEN-degrading enzymes counteracted ZEN-induced toxicity on the gut-reproductive-immune axis. Results: Here, we showed ZEN exposure impaired immune defense in the reproductive-immune axis of pigs during phase 1/2. This impairment was accompanied by altered gut microbial-derived metabolites [e.g., decreased butyrate production, and increased lipopolysaccharides (LPS) production]. Reduction of butyrate production impaired the intestinal barrier via a GPR109A-dependent manner, and together with increased LPS in plasma then aggravated the systemic inflammation, thus directly and/or indirectly disturbing immune defense in the reproductive-immune axis. To validate these findings, we further generated recombinant Bacillus subtilis 168-expressing ZEN-degrading enzyme ZLHY-6 (the Bs-Z6 strain) as a tool to test the feasibility of enzymatic removal of ZEN from mycotoxin-contaminated food. Notably, modified gut microbial metabolites (e.g., butyrate, LPS) through the recombinant Bs-Z6 strain counteracted ZEN-induced toxicity on the intestinal barrier, thus enhancing immune defense in the reproductive-immune axis of pigs during phase-3. Also, butyrate supplementation restored ZEN-induced abnormalities in the porcine small intestinal epithelial cell. Conclusions: Altogether, these results highlight the role of gut microbial-derived metabolites in ZEN-induced toxicity on the gut-reproductive-immune axis. Importantly, targeting these gut microbial-derived metabolites opens a new window for novel preventative strategies or therapeutic interventions for mycotoxicosis associated to ZEN.

AB Studying the variations in soil microbial community diversity and structure along a climate gradient can help to understand the impact of climate change on ecosystem functions regulated by soil microbes. Herein we aimed to reveal and compare the distribution patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities along different vertical climate zones. Five climate zones from subtropical to cold temperate, with altitudes ranging from 1600 m to 3200 m corresponding to different forest types, were selected across the eastern slope of Mount Gongga. The structure and diversity patterns, co-occurrence network of soil microbial communities along the climate gradient and influential factors were studied. The bacterial Shannon and Simpson indices were higher in subtropical and cold temperate zones than in warm and mid-temperate zones, whereas fungal community diversity changed only slightly. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) indicated apparent differences in both bacterial and fungal community composition across the climate zones. The microbial co-occurrence network was more closely connected for fungal than for bacterial communities. Variation partition analysis (VPA) demonstrated that climate, vegetation and soil properties caused variations in bacterial community diversity, while spatial factors were the main factors affecting fungal diversity. These results indicate that climate zonation is more apparent for bacterial than fungal communities, and bacterial communities are more vulnerable to environmental change than fungal communities. The results also indicate that future climate change may affect ecosystem functions by altering microbial community composition structure and diversity.

AB Cattleyak are interspecific hybrids between cattle and yak, exhibiting the same prominent adaptability as yak and much higher performances than yak. However, male infertility of cattleyak resulted from spermatogenic arrest has greatly restricted their effective utilization in yak breeding. In past decades, much work has been done to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest, but little is known about the differences of the post-transcriptional regulators between cattleyak and yak, which may contribute to the impaired spermatogenesis. MiRNAs, a class of endogenous non-coding small RNA, were revealed to play crucial roles in regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level. In the present study, we identified 50 differentially expressed (DE) known miRNAs and 11 novel miRNAs by using Illumina HISeq and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 50 putative target sites for the 13 DE known miRNAs and 30 for the 6 DE novel miRNAs were identified, respectively. GO and KEGG analyses were performed to reveal the functions of target genes for DE miRNAs. In addition, RT-qPCR was performed to validate the expression of the DE miRNAs and its targets. The identification of these miRNAs may provide valuable information for a better understanding of spermatogenic arrest in cattleyak.

AB The dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and its partitioning to the aboveground versus belowground are of fundamental importance to understand carbon cycling and its feedback to climate change. However, the responses of NPP and its partitioning to precipitation gradient are poorly understood. We conducted a manipulative field experiment with six precipitation treatments (1/12 P, 1/4 P, 1/2 P, 3/4 P, P, and 5/4 P, P is annual precipitation) in an alpine meadow to examine aboveground and belowground NPP (ANPP and BNPP) in response to precipitation gradient in 2015 and 2016. We found that changes in precipitation had no significant impact on ANPP or belowground biomass in 2015. Compared with control, only the extremely drought treatment (1/12 P) significantly reduced ANPP by 37.68% and increased BNPP at the depth of 20-40 cm by 80.59% in 2016. Across the gradient, ANPP showed a nonlinear response to precipitation amount in 2016. Neither BNPP nor NPP had significant relationship with precipitation changes. The variance in ANPP were mostly due to forbs production, which was ultimately caused by altering soil water content and soil inorganic nitrogen concentration. The nonlinear precipitation-ANPP relationship indicates that future precipitation changes especially extreme drought will dramatically decrease ANPP and push this ecosystem beyond threshold.

AB Background: There is increasing evidence that children with autism spectrum disorder are accompanied by specific anatomical alterations. However, the anatomical abnormalities in adults with autism spectrum disorder are poorly understood. This study was aimed to identify the neuroanatomical substrates underlying the pathophysiology of adults with autism spectrum disorder. We also investigated the relationship between neuroanatomical alterations and clinical and demographic characteristics.
   Methods: A total of 13 datasets were enrolled, of which 12 studies compared whole-brain differences of 382 adult patients with autism and 393 healthy control subjects. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively estimate regional gray matter volume abnormalities in individuals with autism using the effect-size signed differential mapping.
   Results: The voxel-wise meta-analysis revealed that relative to controls, adults with autism spectrum disorder had significantly increased gray matter volume in the middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, and reduced gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum. Variations in gray matter volume were significantly associated with the mean age and mean total IQ score of the patients, as well as with the percentage of male patients with autism.
   Conclusion: These findings confirmed that the neuroanatomical alterations in the fronto-temporal cortices, limbic system and cerebellum in adult individuals with autism were different from the children and young adolescent's autism. The effects of demographic characteristics on the brain morphological changes allow us to further clarify the neurobiological mechanisms and developmental trajectory in adult population with autism spectrum disorder.

AB BackgroundGenomic structural variation represents a source for genetic and phenotypic variation, which may be subject to selection during the environmental adaptation and population differentiation. Here, we described a genome-wide analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) in 16 populations of yak based on genome resequencing data and CNV-based cluster analyses of these populations.ResultsIn total, we identified 51,461 CNV events and defined 3174 copy number variation regions (CNVRs) that covered 163.8Mb (6.2%) of yak genome with more loss events than both gain and both events, and we confirmed 31 CNVRs in 36 selected yaks using quantitative PCR. Of the total 163.8Mb CNVR coverage, a 10.8Mb region of high-confidence CNVRs directly overlapped with the 52.9Mb of segmental duplications, and we confirmed their uneven distributions across chromosomes. Furthermore, functional annotation indicated that the CNVR-harbored genes have a considerable variety of molecular functions, including immune response, glucose metabolism, and sensory perception. Notably, some of the identified CNVR-harbored genes associated with adaptation to hypoxia (e.g., DCC, MRPS28, GSTCD, MOGAT2, DEXI, CIITA, and SMYD1). Additionally, cluster analysis, based on either individuals or populations, showed that the CNV clustering was divided into two origins, indicating that some yak CNVs are likely to arisen independently in different populations and contribute to population difference.ConclusionsCollectively, the results of the present study advanced our understanding of CNV as an important type of genomic structural variation in yak, and provide a useful genomic resource to facilitate further research on yak evolution and breeding.

AB As a key linkage of C and water cycles, water-use efficiency (WUE) quantifies how much water an ecosystem uses for carbon gain. Although ecosystem C and water fluxes have been intensively studied, yet it remains unclear how ecosystem WUE responds to climate warming and which processes dominate the response of WUE. To answer these questions, we examined canopy WUE (WUEc), ecosystem WUE (WUEe) and their components including gross ecosystem productivity, ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET), soil evaporation (E), and plant canopy transpiration (T), in response to warming in an alpine meadow by using a manipulative warming experiment in 2015 and 2016. As expected, low- and high-level warming treatments increased soil temperature (T-soil) at 10cm on average by 1.65 and 2.77 degrees C, but decreased soil moisture (M-soil) by 2.52 and 7.6vol %, respectively, across the two years. Low- and high-level warming increased WUEe by 7.7 and 9.3% over the two years, but rarely changed WUEc in either year. T/ET ratio determined the differential responses of WUEc and WUEe. Larger T/ET led to less difference between WUEc and WUEe. By partitioning WUEc and WUEe into different carbon and water fluxes, we found that T rather than gross ecosystem productivity or E dominated the responses of WUEc and WUEe to warming. This study provides empirical insights into how ecosystem WUE responds to warming and illustrates the importance of plant transpiration in regulating ecosystem WUE under future climate change.

AB Previous studies have explored the effects of global change on above-ground vegetation in grassland ecosystems. Few, however, have investigated the responses of root dynamics and soil microbes to simulated warming in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This research used field open top chamber experiment to examine warming's impacts. Root production, mortality, and turnover were observed in situ using minirhizotron tubes, while soil microbial community composition and diversity were assessed by using phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) and Biolog-Eco plates. The results showed that 1) warming shifted the root standing crop distribution to deeper soil while increasing the accumulated root mortality and root production at 0-10 cm soil depth; 2) warming increased the abundance of fungal PLFAs while decreasing the abundance of other functional groups; 3) warming decreased the soil microbial functional diversity at the different soil layers; 4) bacterial and fungal PLFA contents were positively correlated with root mortality and turnover but were negatively correlated with root standing crop; 5) root dynamics significantly affect carbon utilization of the soil microbial community; and warming induced changes in root dynamics are associated with soil microbial community structure and function. Overall, these findings indicate that warming alters root production, mortality, and turnover and the relative abundance of different microorganisms in different soil layers. As a result, warming tended to shift microbial communities from bacteria toward fungi, leading to changes in the microbial community structure in different soil layers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel antibacterial strategy is urgently required to develop for solving bacterial biofilm obstruction and bacterial drug resistance in the infected wound healing process. Herein, the Chitosan/Bletilla striata polysaccharide composited microneedles were prepared by chitosan, tannic acid, AgNO3 and Bletilla striata polysaccharide through step centrifugation. In our design system, the porous structure of microneedles gradually disappeared, and the mechanical properties were significantly improved after multiple fillings. Ag+ is reduced insitu to silver nanoparticles by the abundant polyphenols of tannic acid, displaying antibacterial effects both in vitro and vivo, even for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The addition of Bletilla striata polysaccharide increased the ability of piercing biofilm and promoted wound healing. The microneedles exhibited good biocompatibility and with function of piercing the bacterial biofilms, scavenging excessive free radicals, inhibiting inflammatory factors, and promoting wound healing. Therefore, the multifunctional composited microneedles show great potential to promote infected and susceptible wound healing.

AB Designing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts is essential toward realizing the practical application of hydrogen generation by formic acid decomposition (FAD) under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a hybrid material of Pd nanoparticles encapsulated within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Pd-CNTs-in). Transmission electron microscopy images show that most Pd nanoparticles (mean diameter 4.2 +/- 0.8 nm) are located inside the nanotubes. Temperature-programmed reduction studies of H-2 reveal that the average reduction temperature of the Pd(II) species adsorbed on the interior wall of the CNTs is 12 degrees C lower than those adsorbed on the outer walls of the CNT. Moreover, the as-prepared Pd-CNTs-in catalysts show extremely high FAD activity and durability at ambient temperature. The turn over frequency (TOF) value is as high as 1135 h(-1) for the initial 10 min and does not decay significantly during the consecutive 3-time recycling studies. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy (SEIRAS), and gas chromatography (GC) studies indicate that CNT confinement induced electronic structure modulation of Pd could be the major reason for the enhancement of FAD catalysis on the Pd-CNTs-in surface. This work could provide promising strategies for the fabrication of cost-effective and high-active Pd-based catalysts for formic acid dehydrogenation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Growing evidence indicates that plant community structure and traits have changed under climate warming, especially in cold or high-elevation regions. However, the impact of these warming-induced changes on ecosystem carbon sequestration remains unclear. Using a warming experiment on the high-elevation Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we found that warming not only increased plant species height but also altered species composition, collectively resulting in a taller plant community associated with increased net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Along a 1,500 km transect on the Plateau, taller plant community promoted NEP and soil carbon through associated chlorophyll content and other photosynthetic traits at the community level. Overall, plant community height as a dominant trait is associated with species composition and regulates ecosystem C sequestration in the high-elevation biome. This trait-based association provides new insights into predicting the direction, magnitude and sensitivity of ecosystem C fluxes in response to climate warming.
   Quan et al. show that warming-induced changes in plant community height in a cold, high-elevation region enhance ecosystem carbon sequestration, emphasizing the importance of plant traits in shaping the carbon cycle under climate change.

AB Purpose: The link between academic self-efficacy and academic achievement and its potential mediation by learning engagement was investigated in college students in China.Methods: The Chinese versions of the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale, Academic Achievement Scale, and Learning Engagement Scale were administered to 1158 Chinese college students (544 men, 614 women; age [years]: M=19.37, SD=1.16, ranging from 17 to 30 years; college year: 641 freshmen, 302 sophomores, 197 juniors, 18 seniors). Results: The results showed that, among Chinese college students, there were positive correlations between academic self-efficacy and both academic achievement and learning engagement, and between learning engagement and academic achievement. Additionally, a structural equation model demonstrated that learning engagement could mediate the association between academic self-efficacy and achievement.Conclusion: Academic self-efficacy, learning engagement, and academic achievement were found to be significantly and positively associated in Chinese college students, with the association between self-efficacy and achievement observed to be significantly mediated by learning engagement, which mediates the link between self-efficacy and achievement. As the study was cross-sectional, causal inferences were difficult to determine; thus, longitudinal studies should be conducted in the future for further analysis of the causal relationships between these three variables. The present research results reveal the mechanism by which academic self-efficacy of college students impacts their academic achievement, expanding the research perspective of learning engagement, and can help guide the development of interventions to improve college students' academic achievement.

TI Deciphering the atomic-scale structural origin for large dynamic
   electromechanical response in lead-free
   Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based relaxor
   ferroelectrics
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS

AB Despite the extraordinary electromechanical properties of relaxor ferroelectrics, correlating their properties to underlying atomic-scale structures remains a decisive challenge for these "mess" systems. Here, taking the lead-free relaxor ferroelectric Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based system as an example, we decipher the atomic-scale structure and its relationship to the polar structure evolution and large dynamic electromechanical response, using the direct atomic-scale point-by-point correlation analysis. With judicious chemical modification, we demonstrate the increased defect concentration is the main driving force for deviating polarizations with high-angle walls, leading to the increased random field. Meanwhile, the main driving force for deviating polarizations with low-angle walls changes from the anti-phase oxygen octahedral tilting to the multidirectional A-O displacement, leading to the decreased anisotropy field. Benefiting from the competitive and synergetic equilibrium of anisotropic field versus random field, the facilitated polarization rotation and extension versus facilitated domain switching are identified to be responsible for the giant electromechanical response. These observations lay a foundation for understanding the "composition-structure-property" relationships in relaxor ferroelectric systems, guiding the design of functional materials for electromechanical applications.

AB Elastomers embedded with a layer of conductive nanoparticles in the form of a sandwich structure are one of the most popular means to achieve high performance flexible sensors. However, owing to the lack of interaction between adjacent nanoparticles, the number of detached conductive nanoparticles increases when repeated strain/release cycles are applied, thereby causing the electrical resistance of the conductive layer to increase irreversibly. In this work, we report a high-performance piezoresistive sensor based on a novel sandwich structure composite to address this problem. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) were blended to prepare a highly elastic PDMS/PVDF electrospun membrane, then silver nanowire (AgNW) suspensions were directly pumped into the electrospun membranes through a simple filtration process to prepare a conductive layer in a sandwich structure. Accordingly, this hybrid conductive layer was embedded into two layers of PDMS to prepare sandwich structure sensors (PPAP). The PDMS/PVDF electrospun membrane possessed excellent stretch-recovery capability and better interfacial compatibility. More importantly, the porous structure of the membrane effectively restricted the movement range of adjacent nanoparticles and formed a more stable conductive network structure. The maximum gauge factor (GF) of 654.5 of the sensor with a conductive layer structure is significantly higher than those of most reported sensors with a similar sandwich structure. The introduced conductive interlayer is a critical factor to improve the structure stability and dispersion uniformity of the AgNW network while ensuring the interfacial compatibility and elastic matching between the sensing and PDMS layers, which directly improve the durability and hysteresis. The microcrack structure observed in the sensing layer of the PPAP sensor was one of the main reasons for achieving an ultra-high sensitivity of the PPAP sensor. In the end, the wrinkled morphologies are formed after pre-stretching, and the wrinkled sensor exhibits a GF as high as 3058. This study justifies that the sandwich structure exhibits potential for strain sensing applications.

AB In this study, the CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions with cubic-tetragonal interfaces were prepared by an urea hydrolysis method and a solvothermal method. Then they were used as the supports and Mn/Ce-Zr catalysts were prepared by impregnation method. The catalytic performance of the catalysts for toluene oxidation were evaluated by a steady-state measurement and compared with that of Mn/Ce-Zr-ss without the interfaces, in which the support was prepared by co-precipitation. The result was found that the catalyst interfaces apparently enhanced catalytic activity for toluene oxidation. The coexistence of cubic and tetragonal phases and their interfaces were confirmed by XRD and HRTEM. H-2-TPR and XPS results indicated that the cubic-tetragonal interfaces led to stronger interaction between surface Mn and Ce species and higher concentration of lattice oxygen produced from the catalyst surface. DRIFT spectra revealed that the catalyst interface promoted the adsorption of toluene and the formation of key intermediates at low temperatures. These would be important factors that caused a higher activity of the catalyst with cubic-tetragonal interfaces. Moreover, the promoting role of the interfaces might be related to the morphology, surface area and interface components of Ce-Zr supports.

AB Land change is a key topic in research on global environmental change, and the restoration of degraded land is the core component of the global Land Degradation Neutrality target under the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this study, remote-sensing-derived land-use data were used to characterize the land-change processes in China's Loess Plateau, which is experiencing large-scale ecological restoration. Geographically Weighted Regression was applied to capture the spatiotemporal variations in land change and driving-force relationships. First, we explored land-use change in the Loess Plateau for the period 1990-2015. Grassland, cropland and forestland were dominant land cover in the region, with a total percentage area of 88%. The region experienced dramatic land-use transitions during the study period: degraded grassland and wetland, expansion of cropland and built-up land and weak restoration of forestland during 1990-2000; and increases in grassland, built-up land, forestland and wetland, concurrent with shrinking cropland during 2000-2015. A Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis revealed altitude to be the common dominant factor associated with the four major land-use types (forestland, grassland, cropland and built-up land). Altitude and slope were found to be positively associated with forestland, while being negatively associated with cropland in the high, steep central region. For both forestland and grassland, temperature and precipitation behaved in a similar manner, with a positive hotspot in the northwest. Altitude, slope and distance to road were all negatively associated with built-up land across the region. The GWR captured the spatial non-stationarity on different socioeconomic driving forces. Spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation of the impact of socioeconomic drivers indicate that the ecological restoration projects positively affected the region's greening trend with hotspots in the center and west, and also improved farmer well-being. Notably, urban population showed undesired effects, expressed in accelerating grassland degradation in central and western regions for 1990-2000, hindering forestland and grassland restoration in the south during 2000-2015, and highlighting the long-term sustainability of the vegetation restoration progress. Such local results have the potential to provide a methodological contribution (e.g., nesting local-level approaches, i.e., GWR, within land system research) and spatially explicit evidence for context-related and proactive land management (e.g., balancing urbanization and ecological restoration processes and advancing agricultural development and rural welfare improvement).

AB Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (Fndc5) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in the skeletal muscle. It was reported that exercise promotes the shedding of the extracellular domain of Fndc5, generating a circulating peptide (irisin) that cross-talks to adipose tissues to convert lipid-storing white adipocytes to energy-catabolizing beige adipocytes. However, the requirement of Fndc5 in mediating the beneficial effect of exercise remains to be determined. Here, we created a mouse model of Fndc5 mutation through transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated DNA targeting. The Fndc5 mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle development, growth, regeneration, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism at resting state, even when fed a high-fat diet. In response to running exercise, however, the Fndc5 mutant mice exhibit reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and have lower maximal oxygen consumption compared with the exercised wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Fndc5 mutation attenuates exercise-induced browning of white adipose tissue that is crucial for the metabolic benefits of physical activities. These data provide genetic evidence that Fndc5 is dispensable for muscle development and basal metabolism but essential for exercise-induced browning of white adipose tissues in mice.Xiong, Y., Wu, Z., Zhang, B., Wang, C., Mao, F., Liu, X., Hu, K., Sun, X., Jin, W., Kuang, S.

AB Nano-/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano-/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio-based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano-/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano-/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic-mediated multi-molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost-effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano-/microplastics pollutions.

AB Leaves and roots may differ in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and N:P stoichiometry, which can influence plant growth and ecosystem functioning. As compared to leaves, however, relatively little is known about the N versus P scaling relationship and N:P stoichiometry in root systems, particularly in fine roots. We used a global dataset comprising 1,890 observations for a total of 763 terrestrial plant species in 123 families (spanning 433 sites world-wide) to examine live fine root N and P concentrations and stoichiometry, and to determine the scaling of N versus P within and across different plant groups and ecosystems. The global geometric mean values of fine root N and P concentrations and N:P ratios were 10.84mg/g, 0.94mg/g and 11.55, respectively. Fine root N and P concentrations and N:P ratios varied both within and across plant groups and ecosystems. A 0.82-power law described the scaling of fine root N with respect to P across the entire dataset and for major plant phylogenetic and functional groups; however, the numerical value of the N versus P scaling exponent declined from the tropics to higher latitudes and varied significantly at different local sites. Soil nutrient account for much of the variation observed in the scaling of fine root N versus P concentration at different local sites. This study advances our knowledge about limiting resource allocation strategies in below-ground organs and has important implications for modelling plant growth at local, regional and global levels.

AB Materials based on graphene oxide (GO) have good adsorption capacities to various water contaminants in recent studies, owing to GO can provide more active sites than reduced graphene oxide. However, the inefficient preparation methods and tedious separation steps after adsorption limit their application in wastewater treatment. In this report, a facile method is proposed for the synthesis of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-GO composite via ionic interaction. The hydrophobicity of CTAB-GO composite is enhanced by the alkyl chains of CTAB, and thus, it can be readily separated from water-soluble impurities via low-speed centrifugation (3000 rpm for 3 min). The obtained CTAB-GO composite can efficiently remove the azo dye, Congo red from aqueous solutions, with an adsorption capacity as high as 2767 mg/g. Increasing the initial acidity of the solutions enhances the dye removal process. The adsorption kinetic studies reveal that the adsorption equilibrium achieves in similar to 60 min, and the experimental data of the adsorption of Congo red fits well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm. Furthermore, the CTAB-GO composite presents good recycl-ability and the adsorption capacity is greater than 2000 mg/g even at the tenth cycle.

AB This study aimed to prepare antibacterial wound dressings based on collagen and linalool/oxidized amylose inclusion complex. Encapsulation with oxidized amylose was used as an effective way to introduce linalool into collagen matrix. Our results showed that the content of linalool in the composite dressings was efficiently increased thanks to the solubilization effect of oxidized amyloses. The developed composite dressings possessed porous structure. They had abilities to keep the wound in moist environment and meanwhile prevent the excess exudates accumulation. The incorporation of linalool conferred the composite dressings with excellent antibacterial activities as expected. Moreover, the composite dressing with the highest content of linalool presented enhanced blood compatibility and good cell biocompatibility. This composite dressing effectively promoted granulation tissue formation and accelerated wound healing. It effectively prevented inflammation in regenerated skin tissue and scar formation too. Overall, the developed antibacterial wound dressings hold great potential for use in wound healing applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fullerenol, an important water-soluble derivative of fullerene carbon nanomaterial, has been increasingly used in medicine and industry. The presence and release of carbon nanoparticles into the environment have raised concerns over potential impacts on human health and the environment. In this study, the bioaccumulation of fullerenol nanoparticles in wheat was investigated using C-13-labelling techniques. The dose and time-dependent bioaccumulation of fullerenol in wheat was observed, and most fullerenol (about 85.68-263.86% ID per g, percentage of dose per gram tissue) was found in roots. With prolonged culture times, the seedlings treated with relatively low concentrations of fullerenol nanoparticles (2.5 mu g mL(-1)) showed significant increases in C-13 content in roots, while 10.0 mu g mL(-1) fullerenol appeared to suppress this accumulation. Only very limited amounts (< 4.13% ID per g) of fullerenol nanoparticles were translocated from roots to stems and leaves. The presence of fullerenol nanoparticles was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, and small particles were found in the vascular cylinder of wheat roots. During the incubations with fullerenol nanoparticles at all test concentrations, the biomass gain of stems and leaves was unaffected, while root elongation was promoted. Fullerenol also improved the synthesis of chlorophyll in wheat during the 7 d observation period.

AB It is important to seek effective strategies to fabricate nanomaterials with multi-functionalities in noxious gas detection and poisonous waste treatment. Herein, Ag nanoparticles and g-C3N4 nanosheets co-modified ZnO heterostructure was synthesized via a one-step polymer-network gel method, which is used as both photocatalyst and sensing material. Being a visible-light-driven photocatalyst, the ternary ZnO/Ag/g-C3N4 composite produced 100 % Rhodamine B degradation within 30 min with good cycling stability. Besides, the gas sensor based on ZnO/Ag/g-C3N4 exhibited superb room-temperature sensing performance under neutral light excitation, with a response value of 15.3-5 ppm NO2 and a lower detection limitation. The excellent performance was mainly attributed to the significantly enhanced visible-light absorption as well as effectively suppressed charge recombination because of the synergism between the individual components. Moreover, the formation of g-C3N4 nanosheets during thermal oxidation etching plays a critical role in improving the surface area and enriching the surface oxygen vacancies. Thus, this work provides novel insights for the synthesis and multi-applications of ZnO/Ag/g-C3N4 heterostructure with high performance.

AB Background Alpine ecosystem underlain by permafrost is considered as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to disturbance, especially the alpine grassland on the Tibetan plateau with an altitude above 4000 m. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) burrowing can create distinctive bare grounds and cause micro-topographical heterogeneity in alpine grasslands. The burrowing-induced changes in microtopography may directly alter plant and soil interactions as well as ecosystem carbon cycle, which have rarely been studied in Tibetan alpine grasslands. Methods To test the responses of ecosystem respiration (Re) to pika burrowing-induced changes in microtopography, we investigated plant characteristics, soil properties and Re from the bare grounds and vegetated grounds in the alpine meadow and steppe on the Tibetan Plateau. Results Our study showed that vegetation cover, species richness, plant biomass, soil moisture (SM), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (STN), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) in the bare grounds were significantly lower than in the vegetated grounds in both alpine meadow and alpine steppe (P < 0.05). However, soil temperature and inorganic nitrogen tended to increase in the bare grounds. The growing season Re was significantly lower in the bare grounds than that in the vegetated grounds (P < 0.01). Pika burrowing had negative effects on Re and its temperature sensitivity in both alpine vegetations (P < 0.05). The relative changes in Re due to burrowing-induced changes in microtopography were positively correlated with the burrowing caused changes of AGB, BGB, SOC and MBC (P < 0.05). Pika burrowing-induced changes in soil temperature, soil moisture, plant biomass and microbial biomass are the major factors for the decrease of Re in the bare grounds. Conclusion In view of the large number of pika burrows in the alpine grasslands and the loss of soil organic carbon due to pika bioturbation, the impacts of pika burrowing-induced changes in microtopography on Re must be considered in predicting the carbon cycle in alpine grasslands.

AB In this paper, we study the dynamic selling strategy for a firm under asymmetric market and product information over two periods. In each period, the firm can sell the product directly to customers, i.e., direct selling, or through an intermediary retailer such as Amazon and eBay, i.e., agent selling. Before the selling season, the firm is uncertain about the market size and the customers are unaware of whether the product matches their tastes. However, by directly interacting with the customers, the firm under direct selling or the retailer under agent selling will obtain additional market information at the end of the first period. Meanwhile, customers in the second period can resolve their product fit uncertainty by accessing the review comments posted by previous customers, if agent selling is adopted in the first period.
   We show that if the firm and retailer do not share the additional market information with each other, agent selling is never optimal in the second period. However, both direct selling and agent selling may be optimal in the first period, due to the relative effects of the firm's market uncertainty and customers' product fit uncertainty. Interestingly, converse to traditional wisdom, we show that with information sharing, the retailer will always share the additional market information with the firm. Furthermore, in equilibrium, both agent selling and direct selling may be optimal in both periods, depending on the benefit from the additional market information.

AB This review summarizes the recent advances in the catalytic syntheses of CF3S-containing organic molecules using various nucleophilic or electrophilic trifluoromethylthiolating reagents. C-halogen and C-H bonds in various molecules have been transformed to C-SCF3 bonds by transition-metal-catalyzed reactions, such as cross-coupling of aryl halides. Enantioselective reactions controlled by chiral metal complexes or chiral organocatalysts have afforded many trifluoromethylthiolated chiral architectures, such as beta-ketoesters and oxindoles. Very recently, visible-light-induced photoredox trifluoromethylthiolations have been developed, providing versatile CF3S-containing structures efficiently.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary supplemental chromium (Cr) on growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality of broilers reared under heat stress. A total of 252 1-d-old Cobb 500 commercial female broilers were randomly allotted by body weight (BW) to one of six replicate cages (six broilers per cage) for each of seven treatments in a completely randomized design involving a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with three Cr sources (Cr propionate, CrPro; Cr picolinate, CrPic; Cr chloride, CrCl3) and two concentrations of added Cr (0.4, or 2.0 mg of Cr/kg) plus a Cr-unsupplemented control group. Feed and distilled-deionized water were available ad libitum for an experimental phase of 42 days. For induction of heat stress, the house temperature was set at 33 +/- A 2 A degrees C from 15 to 42 days of age. Results showed that birds supplemented with Cr, regardless of Cr source, had increased ADG (P = 0.032) than controls. Birds fed 2.0 mg Cr/kg diet had greater ADG (P = 0.005) than birds fed 0.4 mg Cr/kg diet. Compared to controls, birds fed with Cr had greater dressing percentage (P = 0.021). Percentage of abdominal fat decreased (P = 0.013), whereas, breast intramuscular fat (IMF) remained unaffected (P = 0.147) in Cr supplemented vs control broilers. Broilers supplemented Cr had decreased b* values of meat color (P = 0.042) in breast muscle. B*values were also lesser (P = 0.049) in birds fed CrPro than birds supplemented with CrCl3 or CrPic. Regardless of Cr source, the percentage of cooking loss was decreased (P = 0.025) with Cr supplementation in breast muscle when compared to controls. Results from this study indicate that Cr supplementation, independent of its source, could promote growth and improve carcass traits and meat quality of broilers under heat stress conditions. Chromium propionate seems to have greater beneficial effects on meat color in comparison with CrPic and CrCl3..

AB Real-time monitoring of dopamine (DA) levels, a critical neurotransmitter involved in motor function and blood pressure regulation, requires more sensitive and selective sensors over a dynamic concentration range. The immense need to build highly efficient catalysts has always been at the forefront of electrochemical detection research toward DA. Herein, we design and synthesis an iron carbides-based heterostructure composite (Fe/Fe3C@CNT) by the introduction of microwave-assisted method and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Remarkably, it took only about 1.5 min to completely the preparation process including the pyrolysis of ferrocene (iron sources) and the formation of Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the CNTs. Due to the unique heterostructure, enhanced electrical conductivity and adequate dispersion of active sites, the fabricated sensors exhibit favorable selectivity and great sensing property, yielding a distinguishable and selective response to DA down to 15 nM with a good linearity scope of 0.050-40 mu M. The developed Fe/Fe3C@CNT electrode was then successfully applied to monitor the DA level from the real samples, which holds considerable promise for electrochemical detection and biosensing applications.

AB In this study, Cu-BTC, a kind of metal-organic framework, was used as an adsorbent to selectively adsorb methylene blue (abbreviated as MB) from dye mixed wastewater. The synthesized Cu-BTC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that the synthesized Cu-BTC have an octahedral structure, with its specific surface area at 45.16 m(2)/g and the pore sizes at 35-40 nm. The influence of various parameters including the initial solution pH, temperature, ionic strength, initial concentration, and contact time on MB adsorption by Cu-BTC was investigated in detail. The adsorption capacity of Cu-BTC toward MB was optimized at the pH value of 8, with a lower temperature and a higher ionic strength. The adsorption isotherm was found to fit well with the Langmuir model, and the kinetic curve was found to be in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption mechanism was revealed to be the combined effects of hydrophobicity and electrostatic adsorption. The synthesized Cu-BTC adsorption material showed great potential for recovering MB from dye-mixed wastewater.

AB Graphene-based nanomaterials have been used widely in various environmental applications such as water/ soil decontamination. However, their environmental implications/ biosafety must be properly evaluated. Most studies have focused on their accumulation in, and toxicity to, plant roots, but little is known about their tissue translocation and the risks of modified graphene materials. Here, using a C-13-stable isotope skeleton-labelling technique, we investigated the translocation of two graphene materials in pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) and their effects on photosynthesis in leaves. After the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO), the reduced GO (RGO) was translocated from roots into leaves and directly inhibited the activity of photosystem II (PS II) by damaging the oxygen-evolving-complex on the donor side, which was attributed to oxidative stress. These findings highlight the critical role of chemical reduction in the translocation of graphene materials in plants, and the potential risks of such materials to disrupt important metabolic processes in carbon cycle.

AB The utilization of petroleum-derived synthetic materials causes severe ecological problems, such as environmental pollution and soil degradation. Hence, using naturally derived and renewable materials to fabricate novel biodegradable films for safe and effective food packaging has been a subject of interest over the years. Here, the novel antimicrobial and controlled biodegradable gelatin-based edible films were developed using nisin as the antimicrobial agent, amino-functionalized montmorillonite as the nanoparticle filler, and dialdehyde xanthan gum as the crosslinking agent. The results indicate that the ultraviolet barrier ability, water resistance, and mechanical properties of gelatin-based edible films are obviously improved on account of the crosslinking effect. Moreover, the resulting films demonstrate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus owning to the addition of nisin. Furthermore, the crosslinking can slow down the erosion of the edible films by fungi due to the improved hydrophobicity and compact structure. Particularly, the edible films can be completely biodegraded in soil within 30 days. Meanwhile, the rate of soil biodegradation can be well controlled by adjusting the crosslinking degree. Overall, this novel gelatin-based edible films have potential applications in food packaging.

AB Fatty acid soaps such as sodium stearate (NaOSA) represent a class of cheap, environmentally friendly surfactants; however, their poor solubility seriously challenges their application in various fields. Herein, we describe a CO2/pH-controllable viscoelastic nanostructured fluid, which was developed by simple mixing of the commodity soap NaOSA with a bola-type quaternary ammonium salt (Bola2be) in a 2:1 molar ratio without the need for complex organic synthesis. The introduction of Bola2be increased NaOSA solubility and promoted micelle growth by forming a noncovalent pseudo-Gemini structure, 2NaOSA-Bola2be. Long aggregates are formed with increases in concentration, and these become entangled into a three-dimensional network at 10 times that of the critical micelle concentration (0.057 mM), showing strong thickening ability. Micellar branching occurs above 22.38 mM, as deduced by rheology and verified by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The worm-based fluid formed from the noncovalent pseudo-Gemini surfactant is highly thermosensitive, and features a higher flow activation energy of 399.76 kJ.mol(-1) compared with common worm systems. Because of the pH-sensitivity of NaOSA, the viscoelastic fluid can respond to common pH stimuli or green CO2 gas, and shows a transition between a gel-like wormlike micellar network and a water-like dispersion with precipitate. However, the CO2-responsive behavior is irreversible.

AB Selenium (Se) deficiency can seriously affect the small intestine of swine, and cause diarrhea in swine. However, the specific mechanism of Se deficiency-induced swine diarrhea has rarely been reported. Here, to explore the damage of Se deficiency on the calcium homeostasis and autophagy mechanism of swine, in vivo and in vitro models of swine intestinal Se deficiency were established. Twenty-four pure line castrated male Yorkshire pigs (45 d old, 12.50 +/- 1.32 kg, 12 full-sibling pairs) were divided into 2 equal groups and fed Se-deficient diet (0.007 mg Se/kg) as the Se- deficiency group, or fed Se-adequate diet (0.3 mg Se/kg) as the control group for 16 weeks. The intestinal porcine enterocyte cell line (IPEC-J2) was divided into 2 groups, and cultured by Se-deficient medium as the Se-deficient group, or cultured by normal medium as the control group. Morphological observations showed that compared with the control group, intestinal cells in the Se-deficiency group were significantly damaged, and autophagosomes increased. Autophagy staining and cytoplasmic calcium staining results showed that in the Sedeficiency group, autophagy increased and calcium homeostasis was destroyed. According to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) staining results, the percentage of ROS in the Se-deficiency group was higher than that in the control group in the in vitro model. Compared with the control group, the protein and mRNA expressions of autophagy-calcium-related genes including Beclin 1, microtubule-associated proteins 1A (LC3-1), microtubule-associated proteins 1B (LC3-2), autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5), autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12), autophagy-related protein 16 (ATG16), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CAMKK-beta), adenosine 5'-mono-phosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and calpain in the Se-deficiency group were significantly increased which was consistent in vivo and in vitro (P < 0.05). Altogether, our results indicated that Se deficiency could destroy the calcium homeostasis of the swine small intestine to trigger cell autophagy and oxidative stress, which was helpful to explain the mechanism of Se deficiency-induced diarrhea in swine.

AB Recently, smart hydrogels have attracted much attention for their abilities to respond to subtle changes in external and internal stimuli. Also, natural polysaccharide-based biomaterials are more appealing for their biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, limitations owing to their complex compositions and mechanisms, cumbersome synthetic routes, and single function call for a simple and effective strategy to develop novel multifunctional smart hydrogels. Herein, this developed work was achieved based on Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP), a kind of natural glucomannan with diverse bioactivities and biocompatibility, we fabricated a low-cost multifunctional hydrogel by oxidizing the catechol groups of carboxymethylated BSP(CBSP)-dopamine (DA) conjugate with adhesion, antioxidant, and pH-responsive properties. In this hydrogel system, CBSP as the backbone material, was negatively charged and conferred the hydrogel with pH sensitivity. The presence of catechol groups greatly enhanced the tissue adhesion and antioxidant capacities of the hydrogel. Meanwhile, the highly porous structure of hydrogel allowed berberine to be encapsulated and released to exhibit excellent and long-lasting antibacterial activity. In summary, the adhesion, antioxidant, pH-sensitive, and antibacterial multifunctional hydrogel showed massive potential in the biomedical field.

AB Cadmium (Cd), a widely distributed heavy metal, is extremely toxic to the kidney. Vitamin E (VE) is an important antioxidant in the body. It is known that VE exerts a protective effect on renal oxidative damage caused by Cd, but the effect and mechanism of VE on apoptosis are not fully understood. Thus, we conducted this study to explore the protective effect of VE on Cd-induced renal apoptosis and to elucidate its potential mechanism. Thirty-two 9-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, namely control, VE (100 mg/kg VE), Cd (5 mg/kg CdCl2), and VE + Cd (100 mg/kg VE + 5 mg/kg CdCl2), and received intragastric administration of Cd and/or VE for 4 weeks. The results showed that Cd exposure significantly reduced the weight of the body and kidney, elevated the accumulation of Cd in the kidney as well as the levels of BUN and Scr in serum, caused renal histological alterations, decreased the GSH and T-AOC contents and antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX) activities, and increased renal MDA content. And the increased number of TUNEL-positive cells by Cd was accompanied by upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of apoptotic regulatory molecules (Bax, Caspase-3, GRP94, GRP78, Caspase-8) and downregulated Bcl-2 expressions. However, the combined treatment of Cd and VE could restore the above parameters to be close to those in the control rats. In conclusion, VE supplement could alleviate Cd-induced rat renal damage and oxidative stress through enhancing the antioxidant defense system and inhibiting apoptosis of renal cells.

AB Rhodium (Rh)-based catalysts may solve the long-standing inefficient oxidation of ethanol for direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs); however, the performance of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on existing Rh-based catalysts are far limited. Herein, the Rh-Pb catalysts are synthesized by building Pb and Pb oxide around Rh nanodomain, which shows highly efficient splitting C-C bond and facile further oxidation of as-generated C1 intermediates (CO(ad)and CH(x)fragments). It exhibits an ever-highest EOR peak mass activity of approximate to 2636 mA mg(Rh)(-1)among Rh-based catalysts in alkaline media. Meanwhile, its anodic current remains approximate to 50% even after a 4 h durability test at 0.53 V versus RHE. As for the C1-pathway selectivity, in situ infrared adsorption spectral (IRAS) results demonstrate that it could significantly improve the production of CO2. More directly, the apparent faraday efficiency of EOR C1 pathway is estimated to be as high as 20% (at 0.53 V versus RHE). This Rh-Pb catalyst could hold great promise for developing the commercial DEFCs.

AB For a single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) dc-dc converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM), load variation of one output will affect the voltage of the other output, i.e., there exists cross regulation between its two outputs. To suppress the cross regulation of the SIDO dc-dc converter operating in CCM, a novel ripple based control technique, called capacitor current ripple (CCR) control technique, is proposed in this paper. The operation principle of the SIDO CCM buck converter and the proposed CCR control technique are presented. The small signal model of the CCR-controlled SIDOCCMbuck converter is established by the state space averaging method. Bode plots based on small signal model show that the proposed CCR-controlled SIDO CCM buck converter significantly reduces cross regulation and improves the transient performance compared with the peak current mode controlled SIDO CCM buck converter. In addition, the effect of the variation of loads on the stability of the proposed CCR-controlled SIDO CCM buck converter is analyzed by eigenvalues analysis. Finally, experimental results are provided to verify the analysis results.

The as-prepared Pd/MIL-101 composites were microporous and maintained three-dimensional topology of MIL-101 before and after Pd loading that existed in the skeleton. A carbon bridge was formed between Pd metal and MIL-101 to improve the hydrogen storage. The loaded Pd reduced the hydrogen absorption enthalpy of MIL-101, and thus improved the storage of hydrogen compared with MIL-101. The diffusion coefficient reached 7.233 x 10(-9) in the Pd/ MIL-101 nanocomposites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dramatically different bio-effects of graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have been widely observed in diverse biological systems, which determine the applications and toxicity of graphene materials. To elucidate the mechanism at molecular level, it is urgent to investigate the enzyme-graphene interaction and its consequences. In this study, we comparatively studied the influence of GO and reduced GO (RGO) on the activity and conformation of lysozyme to provide better understandings of their different bioeffects. Both GO and RGO adsorbed large quantities of lysozyme after incubation. GO inhibited lysozyme activity seriously, while RGO nearly had no influence on the enzyme activity. The different inhibitions of enzyme activity could be explained by the lysozyme conformational changes, where GO induced more changes to the protein conformation according to UV-vis absorbance, far-UV circular dichroism spectra, intrinsic fluorescence quenching, and infrared spectra. Based on the spectroscopic changes of lysozyme, GO induced the loss of secondary structure and exposed the active site of lysozyme more to the aqueous environment. In addition, neither GO nor RGO induced the fibrillation of lysozyme after 12 d incubation. The results collectively indicated that the oxidation degree significantly impacted the enzyme-graphene interaction. The implications to the designs of enzyme-graphene system for bio-related applications and the toxicological effects of graphene materials are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elastic hydrogel is a promising material category for designing biological muscles, repairable building materials, flexible electronic devices, and vulcanized rubber substitutes, which is required to have a long life, good self-healing performance and extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, a super-elastic mineral hydrogel is developed with long-lasting moisture, based on dynamic physical crosslinking between hydrated calcium ion clusters and amide groups of polyacrylamide (PAM). The complex hydrogel exhibits a super stretchability of 13 600% at room temperature, and can maintain the super flexibility in a wide temperature range of -40-50 degrees C or for a long period of 28 days. Particularly, the soft material cannot be ignited under an open flame at 400-500 degrees C, because of coupling dual flame retardant mechanisms containing the endothermic effect of liquid water evaporation and the barrier effect of calcium mineral salt on oxygen. In conclusion, the novel complex hydrogel with excellent tensile property, stability in extreme temperature or long operating time, and flame retardancy may become a promising candidate in the fields of agriculture, food, construction, medicine, and machinery.

AB Super-elastic phase change materials (SPCMs), as brand-novel smart materials, have a wide range of potential applications in stress induction, thermal energy storage and temperature control. Polyacrylamide-based HAH@PEG_12h SPCMs with an ultimate tensile ratio greater than 500% were synthesized for the first time by a popular molecular self-assembly technology. In-situ polymerized polyacrylamide (PAM) builds a reversible deformable three-dimensional network, while the filled PEG2000 PCMs form hydrogen bonds with its amino group (-NH2). 260% tensile ratio is impossible to cause obvious liquid leakage for the HAH@PEG2000 form stable phase change material, even exceeding the melting temperature of the PEG2000 PCM. Reversible PAM-NH2 center dot center dot center dot O-PEG hydrogen bond can also reduce the sensitivity of the polyacrylamide-based hydrophobically associated hydrogel (HAH) to air humidity fluctuations. Volumetric deformation ratio of the as-prepared PCM gel is close to zero during water vapour adsorption/desorption, which is much lower than that of the HAH without PEG2000 (20 vol%). Water molecules entering the self-prepared SPCMs are preferentially adsorbed by the PAM 3D architecture, which significantly improves the anti-interference ability of the PEG PCMs. The outstanding comprehensive performance makes the HAH@PEGs SPCMs have great potential in the future.

AB With the superiority of three-dimensional (3D) scanning data, e.g., illumination invariance and pose robustness, 3D face recognition theoretically has the potential to achieve better results than two-dimensional (2D) face recognition. However, traditional 3D face recognition techniques suffer from high computational costs. This paper proposes a fast and robust 3D face recognition approach with three component technologies: a fast 3D scan preprocessing, multiple data augmentation, and a deep learning technique based on facial component patches. First, unlike the majority of the existing approaches, which require accurate facial registration, the proposed approach uses only three facial landmarks. Second, the specifical deep network with an improved supervision is designed to extract complementary features from four overlapping facial component patches. Finally, a data augmentation technique and three self-collected 3D face datasets are used to enlarge the scale of the training data. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on four public 3D face benchmarks, i.e., 100%, 99.75%, 99.88%, and 99.07% rank-1 IRs with the standard test protocol on the FRGC v2.0, Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, and 3D-TEC datasets, respectively. Further, it requires only 0.84 seconds to identify a probe from a gallery with 466 faces. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are currently facing two difficulties in achieving their general use: the lack of hydrogen refueling stations and high hydrogen prices. Hydrogen refueling stations are the middle stage for delivering hydrogen from its sources to consumers, and their location could be affected by the distributed locations of hydrogen sources and consumers. The reasonable siting and sizing of hydrogen refueling stations could both improve the hydrogen infrastructure and reduce regional consumers' cost of using hydrogen. By considering the hydrogen life cycle cost and using a commercial volume forecasting model, this paper creates a relatively thorough and comprehensive model for hydrogen station siting and sizing with the objective of achieving the optimal costs for consumers using hydrogen. The cost-based model includes the selection of the hydrogen sources, transportation methods, and storage methods, and thus, the hydrogen supply chain can also be optimized. A numerical example is established in Section 4 with the solution algorithm and results.

AB Alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are undergoing degradation. However, little is known regarding the response of soil nematodes to this degradation. We conducted investigations in a wet meadow (WM), a grassland meadow (GM), a moderately degraded meadow (MDM) and a severely degraded meadow (SDM) from April to October 2011. The nematode community taxonomic composition was similar in the WM, GM and MDM and differed from that in the SDM. The abundance declined significantly from the WM to the SDM. The taxonomic richness and Shannon index were comparable between the WM and MDM but were significantly lower in the SDM, and the Pielou evenness showed the opposite pattern. The composition, abundance and diversity in the WM and SDM were relatively stable over time compared with other habitats. The abundances of all trophic groups, aside from predators, decreased with degradation. The relative abundances of herbivores, bacterivores, predators and fungivores were stable, while those of omnivores and algivores responded negatively to degradation. Changes in the nematode community were mainly driven by plant species richness and soil available N. Our results demonstrate that alpine wetland degradation significantly affects the soil nematode communities, suppressing but not shifting the main energy pathways through the soil nematode communities.

AB Palaeoethnobotanical research at the Yuezhuang site, a Houli Culture settlement in Jinan, Shandong Province, China, dating to 8000-7700 cal. BP, documents human-environment interaction and the local subsistence economy soon after the initiation of food production in the region. This economy supported a sizeable community that occupied a kilometer stretch of floodplain along the Nandasha River. The research explores plant domestication, the extent to which the Yuezhuang population had developed a food production niche, and, to a lesser extent, the development of agriculture in the lower Yellow River valley. In order to do so, charred seeds from a variety of plant taxa were recovered by flotation of sediment from pits and cultural strata. Just over 30% of the seed assemblage is rice (Oryza sativa), broomcorn/common millet (Panicum miliaceum), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica subsp. italica). The status of several other plants such as soybean (Glycine max subsp. max or G. max subsp. soja), perilla (Perilla sp.), and chenopod (Chenopodium sp.) that are also cultivated in East Asia is also assessed. Most of the plant taxa are from open, sunlit, and anthropogenic, disrupted habitats. Diverse grasses similar to those found at later sites indicate that the farming niche documented at the late Neolithic Longshan Culture in Shandong Province was being established by 8000-7700 cal. BP. The plant remains assemblage is compared with three assemblages, two belonging to the Houli Culture and one from the late Neolithic Longshan Culture. Anthropogenic habitats and their formation, maintenance and use, wetland exploitation, cultivation, hunting-gathering-fishing, and animal management characterize the mature (late) Houli Culture niche.

AB In this study, chlorpyrifos residue levels in field crops of rice, maize and soybean were investigated according to the "Guideline on Pesticide Residue Trials" of China. On the basis of the residual results, human dietary risks were further evaluated. Chlorpyrifos residues of harvest grains were firstly prepared by QuEChERS method and analyzed using Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/ MS). Dietary risks were assessed by a deterministic approach. The median residues in field trials of rice, maize and soybean were 0.617, 0.0227 and 0.0136 mg kg(-1), respectively. The highest residues in field trials of rice, maize and soybean were 3.23, 0.114 and 0.102 mg kg(-1), respectively. Chronic intake assessment indicated that only 39.0% of acceptable daily intake (ADI, 0-0.01 mg kg bw(-1) day(-1)) was consumed through rice, maize and soybean. The acute hazard indexes (aHI) of adults was 26.1% of acute reference dose (ARfD, 0-0.1 mg kg bw(-1)) and aHI of children was 63.5% of ARfD in dietary exposure assessment through rice, maize and soybean consumption. Single pathway risk assessment indicated that chlorpyrifos application on field crops in manner of the good agricultural practices didn't pose public health risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum Lee (LF-Lee) on activated carbon-induced constipation in ICR mice. ICR mice were orally administered lactic acid bacteria for nine days. Body weight, dietary and water intake, defecation status, gastrointestinal (GI) transit and defecation time, as well as levels of motilin (MTL), gastrin (Gas), endothelin (ET), somatostatin (SS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in serum were measured to evaluate the preventive effects of LF-Lee on constipation. Bisacodyl, a laxative drug, was administered as a positive control. The time taken until the first defecation of a black stool for normal, control, bisacodyl- (100 mg/kg, oral administration), Lactobacillus bulgaricus (LB)-, LF-Lee low dose (L)- and LF-Lee high dose (H)-treated mice was 90, 218, 117, 180, 161 and 151 min, respectively. Following the consumption of LB, LF-Lee (L) or LF-Lee (H), or the oral administration of bisacodyl, the GI transit was reduced to 55.2, 65.8, 73.1 and 94.6%, respectively, of the transit in normal mice. The serum levels of MTL, Gas, ET, AChE, SP and VIP were significantly increased and those of SS were reduced in the mice treated with LF-Lee compared with those in the untreated control mice (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that lactic acid bacteria have preventive effects on constipation in mice and that LF-Lee has superior functional activity.

AB Background: Chronic diarrhea is a common disease causing morbidity and mortality of captive rhesus macaques (RMs, Macaca mulatto). Chronic diarrhea in RMs is typically characterized by long-term diarrhea and a weak response to antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea is also a common disease in humans and can cause death. However, the etiology of about half of diarrhea) cases of humans is still unclear. Therefore, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize the differences in the gut microbiome and resistome of chronic diarrhea RMs and asymptomatic individuals.
   Results: Our results showed Lactobacillus spp. (mainly L. johnsonii, L. reuteri and L. amylovorus) were significantly depleted in chronic diarrhea RM guts compared to asymptomatic individuals (5.2 vs 42.4%). Functional annotation of genes suggested these Lactobacillus spp. carried genes involved in the adhesion of intestinal epithelial cells and production of bacteriocin. Chronic diarrhea RM guts also had a significantly greater abundance of many other gut bacteria, including mucin-degrading bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. The metabolic pathways of chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome were enriched in aerobactin biosynthesis, while the metabolic pathways of asymptomatic RM gut microbiome were enriched in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Chronic diarrhea RM guts had a significantly greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), such as ermF, aph(3')-IIIa, ermB, and fIoR. The strains isolated from feces and tissue fluid of chronic diarrhea RMs had higher resistance rates to the majority of tested antibiotics, but not cephamycin and carbapenem antibiotics. Gut microbial composition comparisons showed that several captive nonhuman primate (NHP) guts were more similar to the guts of humans with a non-westernized diet than humans with a westernized diet. Chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome was strikingly similar to rural-living humans with diarrhea and humans with a non-westernized diet than asymptomatic RMs.
   Conclusions: Our results suggested chronic diarrhea significantly altered the composition and metabolic pathways of the RM gut microbiome. The frequent use of antibiotics caused antibiotic resistance in chronic diarrhea RM gut microbiome with serious consequences for individual treatment and survival. The findings of this study will help us to improve the effective prevention and treatment of diarrhea in RMs.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into several cell types under appropriate conditions. They also possess remarkable antitumor features that make them a novel choice to treat cancers. Accumulating evidence suggest that the MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles, known as exosomes, play an essential role in the therapeutic effects of MSCs mainly by carrying biologically active factors. However, limitations such as low yield of exosomes and difficulty in isolation and purification hinder their clinical applications. To overcome these issues, research on development of exosome-mimics has attracted great attention. This systematic review represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first thorough evaluations of the innate antineoplastic features of MSCs-derived exosomes or exosome-mimics, the methods of drug loading, application as drug delivery system and their impacts on targeted cancer therapy. Importantly, we dissect the commonalities and differences as well as address the shortcomings of work accumulated over the last two decades and discuss how this information can serve as a guide map for optimal experimental design implementation ultimately aiding the effective transition into clinical trials.

AB TiO2 nanorod (NR) array for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attained great importance due to its superb power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that of the traditional mesoporous TiO2 film. A TiO2 compact layer for the growth of TiO2 NR array via spin-coating cannot meet the requirements for efficient NR-based PSCs. Herein, we have developed and demonstrated the insertion of a bifunctional extrathinTiO(2) interlayer (5 nm) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at the interface of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 compact layer to achieve alleviated electron exchange and a reduced energetic barrier. Thus, an accelerated extraction of electrons fromTiO(2) NR arrays via the compact layer and their transfer to the FTO substrate can improve the PSC efficiency. The thickness of the spin-coatedTiO(2) compact layer on the ALD-deposited TiO2 layer is spontaneously optimized. Finally, an outstanding efficiency of 20.28% has been achieved from a champion PSC with negligible hysteresis and high reliability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the superiority of TiO2 -NR-based PSCs withstanding the dry heat and thermal cycling tests. The results are of great importance for the preparation of efficient and durable PSCs for real-world applications.

AB Understanding the interaction between large herbivores and pasture production, especially with respect to the grazing optimization hypothesis, is critical for pasture management and generating theoretical and testable predictions. However, the optimization hypothesis remains contradictory in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). In this study, we tested the grazing optimization hypothesis using four yak-grazing intensities (no grazing, light grazing, moderate grazing and heavy grazing) in alpine meadow habitats from 2015 to 2017. The results indicated that species diversity did not differ significantly among grazing regimes during the experimental period. However, the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) under moderate grazing consistently significantly exceeded that in control enclosures over 3 years, confirming the grazing optimization hypothesis. Levels of overcompensation varied among grazing intensities and years, and grazing-induced plant compensation may only occur in the short term. The enhanced regrowth of Poaceae and Cyperaceae induced by yak grazing might contribute to the overall level of overcompensation by plant community. Our results strongly support the grazing optimization hypothesis in the context of alpine meadows grazed by yaks, emphasizing the complex interactions between ANPP, herbivores and other ecological factors in alpine meadows on the QTR These findings provide new insights for the development of an ecological conservation strategy that will help restore this fragile ecosystem and balance the seemingly incompatible requirements of animal husbandry.

AB This paper addresses the stability issue of delayed switched nonlinear systems whose subsystem is of the form (x) over dot(t) = A(t, x(t), x (t - d(t)))x(t) + B(t, x(t), x (t - d(t)))x (t - d(t)), that is, the system matrices depend on time and the present and past states. By means of a trajectory-based comparison approach, stability of original switched nonlinear system is transformed into that of a switched positive linear system called a comparison system. The involved delays are piecewise continuous and may be unbounded. The comparison switched system may consist of unstable subsystems. It is shown that if the comparison system is asymptotically or exponentially stable, then the original system is asymptotically or exponentially stable, globally or locally, depending on the domain chosen to form the comparison system.

AB Wireless power transfer (WPT) provides a novel solution to the painstaking power-charging issue in wireless sensor networks. However, due to the propagation loss, the fast attenuation in energy transfer efficiency over the transmission distance is the main impediment to the WPT application. In this paper, we apply the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to a wirelessly powered sensor network, where each node has two circuits, which operate on energy harvesting mode and information decoding mode separately. We propose a novel cooperative SWIPT scheme (CSS) for this system. First, we present a conflict-free schedule initialization algorithm for CSS. For a given conflict-free schedule, we formulate a resource allocation problem to maximize the network energy efficiency, which is then transformed to an equivalent convex optimization problem and resolved via dual decomposition. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is presented to achieve the transmission schedule with the maximum energy efficiency and the corresponding resource assignment policy. Simulation results indicate that the CSS can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the wirelessly powered sensor network.

AB Physical stability and lipid digestion of protein-stabilized Pickering emulsions interacting with polysaccharides have been emphasized in our previous investigation. However, the polysaccharide coating and micelle protection of protein-based stable Pickering emulsion and its three-dimensional (3D) printing properties have not been thoroughly studied. The rheological properties and 3D printing properties of gelatin-catechin nanoparticles (GCNPs) stabilized Pickering emulsion were studied by using different charged polysaccharides, such as inulin (neutral), Xanthan gum (XG, anion), and chitosan (cation) as stable materials. The microstructure analysis of polysaccharide-stabilized Pickering emulsion (PSPE) showed that the order of pore wall thickness was GC-Chitosan > GC-XG > GC-Inulin. The network structure of GC-Chitosan was thickened, allowing the 3D printed product to have a good surface texture and adequate support. Rheological analysis showed that PSPEs in extrusion (shear thinning), self-support (rigid structure), and recovery (the outstanding thixotropy) of the three stages exhibited good potential of 3D printing. 3D printing results also showed that GC-Chitosan had the best printing performance.

AB Grain size shows significant influence on electrical properties of piezoceramics. However, there are few works to investigate the grain size effects in high-performance and large-grain piezoceramics and uncover the structure origin. In this work, large grain size from -53 to -92 mu m was achieved in a high-performance BaTiO3 (BT)-based ceramic via tuning sintering conditions. With grain size increasing, the ceramics exhibit same multiphase coexistence state, similar phase transition temperature, upward TC dielectric peaks and reduced diffuseness degree. Because of the larger and more complex non-180 degrees domains within bigger grains, the improvement in remnant polarization (Pr), coercive field and negative strain were observed in bigger-grain ceramics. The elevated Pr finally leads to the piezoelectric coefficient d33 increasing from 500 to 650 pC/N. However, too large grains may cause the reduced strain due to the high remnant strain in first cycle. Therefore, big grain size is conducive to achieve high piezoelectricity while moderate grain size can facilitate strain response in highperformance ceramics with large grains, which is quite different with pure BT ceramic. This work presents insights into the grain size effects and affords guides to further optimize electrical properties in high-performance piezoceramics with large grains.

AB The appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria and their biofilms presents a serious threat to modern medical systems. Herein, we fabricated a novel gold-nanorod-based chemo-photothermal-integrated antimicrobial platform with surface-charge-switchable and near-infrared (NIR)-induced size-transformable activities that show an enhanced killing efficiency against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes. The nanocomposites are prepared by in situ copolymerization using N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM), acrylic acid (AA), and N-allylmethylamine (MAA) as monomers on the surfaces of gold nanorods (GNRs). Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is loaded onto polymer shells of nanocomposites with a loading content of 9.8%. The negatively charged nanocomposites switch to positive upon passive accumulation at the infectious sites, which promotes deep biofilm penetration and bacterial adhesion of the nanoparticles. Subsequently, NIR irradiation triggers the nanocomposites to rapidly shrink in volume, further increasing the depth of biofilm penetration. The NIR-triggered, ultrafast volume shrinkage causes an instant release of CIP on the bacterial surface, realizing the synergistic benefits of chemo-photothermal therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrate that drug-loaded nanocomposites could eradicate clinical MRSA biofilms. Taken together, the multifunctional chemo-photothermal-integrated antimicrobial platform, as designed, is a promising antimicrobial agent against MRSA infections.

AB Firm innovation may benefit from the power advantage within an innovation network, yet too much power may be counterproductive. In this study, we aim to reconcile this paradox and explore how firms can come up with more breakthrough innovations by leveraging power in an innovation network. Specifically, we conceptualize network power and investigate its impacts on breakthrough innovation. Building on the resource-based view and resource dependence theory, we first identify two types of network power, namely, knowledge power and relational power. We then explore the relationships between these two power types and breakthrough innova-tion, as well as the mediation effect of knowledge integration on the relationships. Survey data from 233 Chinese high-tech companies demonstrate that both knowledge power and that relational power have inverted U-shaped relationships with breakthrough innovation, and knowledge integration partially mediates the above relation-ships. Our study extends power bases in an innovation network to knowledge and relational ties, reconciles the power-leveraging paradox in explaining innovation issues of firms, and reveals the mediation mechanism of knowledge integration. Our findings also offer some valuable implications for managers.

AB Grassland degradation has profound negative impacts on ecological functions, local economic development, and social stability. Although there are many studies on the alpine grassland degradation in the Tibetan Plateau, the variation in the response of alpine meadows to degradation and restoration processes, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To explore these issues, we selected nine grassland degradation levels along an increasing gradient at Zoige in the Tibetan Plateau, and collected vegetation and soil samples in August 2017 and 2018 to assess the state of the grassland before and after grazing exclusion (GE), respectively. The results showed that above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB), Shannon-Wiener index, soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (STN), and total phosphorus decreased gradually with severe degrees of degradation, whereas soil bulk density and pH increased. SWC in the topsoil presented the sharpest change in slope along the degradation gradient, indicating that SWC was a sensitive indicator of alpine meadow degradation in this area. One-year GE evidently increased SWC, SOC, STN, AGB, and BGB in lightly and moderately degraded grasslands. The restoration efficiency of GE first increased and then decreased along the degradation gradient, with the turning point appearing at the third or fourth degradation level. Based on these results, we can conclude that short-term GE is an effective method for grassland restoration in this humid area, and should be performed at the shift from light to moderate degradation stages when the efficiency of recovery is the highest. These findings could facilitate a better approach for the restoration of degraded alpine meadow ecosystems.

AB Background and aims Seasonal grazing is a traditional grassland management practice in alpine swamp meadows on the Tibetan Plateau, but little information is available on the interactions between plant diversity and soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration in warm- and cold- season grazed alpine swamp meadows. Methods A multisite survey was conducted to investigate the plant characteristics and soil properties of Tibetan alpine swamp meadows under warm-season grazing (WG) and cold-season grazing (CG). Results Our study showed that plant biomass, litter mass, soil water content (SW), soil available nitrogen, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly lower in the WG meadows than in the CG meadows (P < 0.05). However, plant diversity, species richness and the evenness index tended to increase in the WG meadows. Soil C and N storage were significantly lower in the WG meadows than in the CG meadows (P < 0.01). Grazing-induced changes in SW, plant diversity, plant biomass and litter mass were the major factors resulting in the decrease in soil C and N storage. Conclusions Our results indicate that warm-season grazing is beneficial for species diversity conservation, whereas cold-season grazing is suitable for soil C and N sequestration in alpine swamp meadows. Grazing-induced changes in litter mass greatly contributed to variations in plant diversity and soil C and N storage. In view of the accelerated vegetation and soil degradation in alpine grasslands, periodic warm- and cold-season grazing strategies should be considered to maintain alpine swamp meadow sustainability.

AB This research aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of phosphorylated Radix Cyathulae officinalis Kuan polysaccharides (pRCPS) in immunosuppressed mice, improving their cellular and humoral immune function. Our results showed that pRCPS increased serum immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM) concentrations significantly, enhanced splenocyte proliferation, and the thymus and spleen indices. pRCPS also promoted phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages and enhanced cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-2, -4, -5, -6, and -10) serum levels. Importantly, pRCPS increased the proportions of selected T cell subpopulations (CD3(+), CD4(+), and the CD4(+) to CD8(+) ratio). Our results revealed that phosphorylation of the polysaccharides promoted their immune-enhancing effects. Thus, pRCPS can enhance cellular and humoral immunity and could be used as an immune-enhancing agent to overcome cyclophosphamide (CY)-induced immunosuppression.

AB A new PVDF composite cathode membrane (PCCM) with electro-deposited Pd-rGO on PVDF/carbon fiber cloth, abbreviated as Pd-rGO PCCM, was developed. The as-prepared Pd-rGO PCCM was characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD. And it was further used in membrane bioreactor (MBR)/microbial fuel cell (MFC) coupled wastewater treatment system. The results indicated after electro-deposition, the Pd-rGO was uniformly distributed on the surface of PCCM. Under 15 cycled Pd electro-deposition on carbon fiber cloth, the Pd-15-rGO PCCM exhibited the highest catalytic activity compared to other cycles, and the optimized deposition density of rGO and Pd were 0.124 mg cm(-2) and 2.31 mg cm(-2) respectively. Under an electric field of -0.4 V cm(-1), the Pd-15-rGO PCCM showed approximately 1.9 times improvement of stable membrane flux (128-130 Lm(-2) h(-1)) compared to the condition without electric field (66 Lm(-2) h(-1)). In MBR/MFC wastewater treatment system, using Pd-15-rGO PCCM as cathode membrane, the maximum power density was 1210 mW m(-3), approximately 3.8 times higher than using initial PCCM (312 mW m(-3)). Moreover, The Pd-15-rGO PCCM in MBR/MFC coupled system showed excellent contaminants removal rates towards both traditional organic contaminants (COD at 90% and NH4+-N at 81%) in sewage and trace persistent contaminants (i.e. PAHs and phenols) in the effluent of coking wastewater.

TI Reinforcement learning-based QoS/QoE-aware service function chaining in

SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES

DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS
AB With the ever-growing diversity of devices and applications that will be connected to 5G networks, flexible and agile service orchestration with acknowledged quality of experience (QoE) that satisfies the end user's functional and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is necessary. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) are considered key enabling technologies for 5G core networks. In this regard, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based QoS/QoE-aware service function chaining (SFC) scheme in SDN/NFV-enabled 5G slices. First, it implements a lightweight QoS information collector based on the Link Layer Discovery Protocol, which works in a piggyback fashion on the southbound interface of the SDN controller, to enable QoS-awareness. Then, a deep Q-network-based orchestration agent is designed to support SFC in the context of NFV. The agent takes into account the QoE and QoS as key aspects to formulate the reward so that it is expected to maximize QoE while respecting QoS constraints. The experiment results show that the proposed framework exhibits good performance in QoE provisioning and QoS requirements maintenance for SFC in dynamic network environments.

AB Global climate change is accompanied by changes in the amounts of ice and snow. These changes have both a direct effect on the plant community structure, primary productivity and carbon cycle and an indirect influence on the belowground ecosystem. However, the effects of changes in snowpack on the soil environment and belowground ecological processes, particularly in soil microbial communities are still poorly understood in alpine meadows. We conducted a field study of controlled snowpack in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, where five treatments were set up, named as S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4 (S1: the amount of a natural snowpack; S2, S3, and S4 were twofold, threefold, and fourfold of Sl, respectively; and SO: completely removed snow). Soil physicochemical properties, soil community structure and diversity measured by 16S rRNA gene amplicons were studied. The results indicated that 1) as snowpack increased, the average soil temperature decreased, but soil moisture and soil compaction increased; 2) soil chemical properties (pH, available nitrogen, available potassium, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, total potassium, total phosphorus and total soil organic carbon) all changed as snowpack changed; and 3) increasing snowpack led to a decrease in the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, but Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria did not decline in response to increasing snowpack. In summary, these results showed that soil bacterial communities are sensitive to changes in snowpack in alpine meadows.

AB A solid solution of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/Carbon composite has been successfully synthesized by introducing carbon nanotubes (CNT) into the microspheres with porous structure during the spray drying and calcination process. The micro-spherical CNT-embedded LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C composite delivers the features of high voltage, high rate, and cycling stability, which are urgently needed for the development of commercial lithium ion batteries. Benefiting from the subtle porous structure with a moderate specific area, the micro-spherical LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C samples without CNT material exhibits a high reversible capacity (162 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and good rate performance. CNT, embedded in the microspheres and entangling with the primary particles, can enhance an interconnected conducting network and optimize the electron transport pathways, resulting in improved lithium ion diffusion coefficient. Therefore, the increased rate capability and cycling performance are obtained. When charged and discharged at 20 C, the composite of LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C microspheres with only 0.5 wt% CNT embedded, still exhibits an obviously higher capacity (128.7 mAh g(-1)) than those without CNT (120.8 mAh g(-1)). It also delivers a higher capacity retention of 91.6% up to 500 cycles at 5 C, showing excellent long-term cycle life. Tested in full batteries with Li4Ti5O12 as anode, the CNT-embedded LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C microspheres have shown its promising potential in practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Oxidized beta-cyclodextrins with different oxidation levels were prepared using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant and copper sulfate as the catalyst. The physicochemical, antimicrobial and antifungal properties of oxidized beta-cyclodextrin were systematically studied. The results showed that the oxidation level of oxidized beta-cyclodextrin was successfully controlled by adjusting the dosage of hydrogen peroxide. The aqueous solubility of oxidized beta-cyclodextrin was highly improved as expected. However, oxidation changed the morphology and partly reduced the crystallinity of oxidized beta-cyclodextrin due to the introduced carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It is interesting that oxidized beta-cyclodextrin presented a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which was efficiently improved with the increasing oxidation level. Growth of A. niger spores was efficiently inhibited in the presence of oxidized beta-cyclodextrin. Moreover, oxidized beta-cyclodextrin could effectively extend the storage time of apple. In summary, oxidized beta-cyclodextrin shows potential as antimicrobial and antifungal agents in food industry.

AB As a central research topic in the field of positive psychology, hope refers to an individual's goal-oriented expectations that include both agency thinking (i.e., the motivation to initiate and sustain actions to achieve goals) and pathway thinking (i.e., the capacity to find ways toward goals). Evidence from many previous studies has shown the role of hope in protecting against anxiety. However, little is known about the neurobiological basis of hope and the underlying mechanism that how hope reduces anxiety in the brain. Here, we employed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to investigate these issues in 231 high school students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). The whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that higher trait hope was related to lower fALFF in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), which is involved in reward-related processing, motivation production, problem solving and goal-directed behaviors. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggested that trait hope acted as a mediator in the association between mOFC spontaneous activity and anxiety. These results persisted even after adjusting for the effects of positive and negative affect. Overall, this study provides the first evidence for functional brain substrates underlying trait hope and reveals a potential mechanism that trait hope mediates the protective role of spontaneous brain activity against anxiety.

AB In nonruminants, it is well established that elongation of very long-chain fatty acid-like fatty acid elongase 6 (ELOVL6) catalyzes the synthesis of C18:0 from C16:0 in lipogenic tissues like adipose and liver. However, the role of ELOVL6 in regulating lipid metabolism in ruminant mammary gland remains unknown. In the present study, ELOVL6 was overexpressed or knocked down via adenoviral transfection to assess its role in goat mammary epithelial cells. Results revealed that ELOVL6 overexpression had a weak effect on the expression of genes related to triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and desaturation. Overexpression of ELOVL6 increased the content of C18:0 at the expense of C16:0, and increased the elongation index of C16:0. Overexpression of ELOVL6 had no significant effect on the elongation index of C16:1n-7 and the desaturation indices of C16:0 and C18:0. Knockdown of ELOVL6 had a negative effect on mRNA expression of the esterification genes GPAM and diacylglycerolacyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) and TAG concentration; however, it increased the concentration of C16:0 and decreased C18:1n-7 and C18:1n-9 in goat mammary epithelial cells. Accordingly, downregulation of ELOVL6 significantly decreased the elongation indices of C16:0 and C16:1n-7. The lack of change in the desaturation indices of C16:0 and C18:0 upon knockdown of ELOVL6 was consistent with the minor change in SCD1 expression. In conclusion, these are the first results highlighting an important role of ELOVL6 in long-chain fatty elongation and TAG synthesis in ruminant mammary cells.

AB Mariculture wastewater contains a diverse array of pollutants, such as antibiotics, heavy metals, and ammonia nitrogen (NH+4 -N). The concurrent removal of multiple pollutants has emerged as an urgent problem that demands immediate attention. In this research, photovoltaic powered ocean-based electrochemical system (POECs) was employed to treat mariculture wastewater. POECs exhibited outstanding performance in the treatment of mariculture wastewater, attaining high removal rates for various pollutants: 98 % for TC, 97.4 % for Cu(II), and 95.5 % for NH+4 -N. The integration of the bioelectrochemical system (BES) and the electrolytic cell (EC) augmented the overall treatment capacity of the system. This integration led to the generation of a variety of highly oxidizing active species, including hydroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species (RCS). In the anode chamber, the ocean - sourced sludge served as a source of bioelectricity. At the class level, functional microorganisms like Gammaproteobacteria and Campylobacteria were the dominant species. The study offers technical optimization for the environmentally-friendly treatment of mariculture wastewater and holds promising prospects for engineering applications.

AB To discuss how to promote the rapid development of new energy vehicles (NEVs) through low regulatory costs after the removal of financial subsidies, in this paper, an evolution-ary game model between local governments and vehicle manufacturers is developed. In the model, we suppose a series of parameters based on academic research and practical situations. Then the model and its parameters are analyzed and verified by system dy-namics simulation. The study shows that: (1) Compared with the static, the dynamic dual credit policy enables the system to have an equilibrium stability point, which helps the development of NEVs. (2) The cost of local government regulation is reduced by the effec-tive implementation of the dynamic dual credit policy. (3) After the removal of financial subsidies, consumers focus on personal experience. Therefore, government and enterprises should focus on technological breakthroughs and infrastructure development.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The formation of dendrites during the repeated plating and stripping is the main reason that hinders practical application of zinc metal anode. Different substrates show different deposition behaviors for zinc deposition, which indicates that zinc deposition is closely related to the interface of substrate. Herein, several representative substrates (Cu, Sn, Ag, Ti, Ni, Pb, Al, stainless steel and carbon cloth) were selected to systematic investigate the deposition characteristics of zinc on different substrates. The results show that the Cu substrate exhibits the best performance compared with other substrates. The half cell with Cu as substrate still maintains high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% after 8000 cycles at high current density of 20 mA cm-2. Combined with DFT calculation, it is found that too low binding energy of substrate to zinc cannot induce zinc plating, and too strong binding energy is not conducive to the process of stripping. During zinc deposition, the substrate in situ forms an alloy phase with zinc from XRD and XPS analysis. Therefore, investigation on the influence of different substrates on zinc deposition and understanding the factors affecting zinc deposition have a good guiding significance for the modification of the electrode interface.

AB Crosslinking is frequently used to improve the inherent poor physicochemical properties of collagen. However, local flocculation and irregular crosslinking of collagen would be unavoidably occurred once contacting with crosslinking agents due to widespread complex interactions. Herein, dialdehyde starch-based nanoparticles were developed to crosslink collagen as a new strategy. Starch was conjugated with cholesterol chloroformate before periodate oxidation to obtain dialdehyde cholesterol modified starch (DACS). DACS self-assembled into nano particles (DACSNPs) and crosslinked with collagen to fabricate collagen hydrogels (DACSNPs-Col). DACSNPs-Col hydrogels exhibited faster gelation rate, better uniform porous structure, higher mechanical properties and better degradation stability than dialdehyde starch crosslinked hydrogels. Significantly, DACSNPs-Col hydrogels show homogeneous structure, improved mechanical properties, low cytotoxicity, well blood compatibility, high cell adhesion and proliferation. Overall, the oxidized polysaccharide nanoparticles crosslinked collagen hydrogels have homogeneous and compact microstructure and improved physicochemical properties, which show potential application prospect in the field of tissue engineering scaffold.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which re-emerged in China since 2010, has swept across the whole country leading to tremendous economic losses. In this study, a total of 645 diarrhea samples collected from 156 pig farms in Sichuan and Guizhou province during 2014-2018 were tested for PEDV. We found that samples from 47.66% (84/156) of the farms were positive for PEDV with an overall detection rate of 35.81% (231/645). Fifty-two strains were selected for full-length S gene analyses, and these strains were classified into three subgroups, an S-INDEL subgroup (G1c), and two non-S-INDEL subgroups (G2b, AJ1102-like and G2c), accounting for 15.38% (8/52), 23.08% (12/52) and 59.62% (31/52) of the total analysed strains, respectively. We found these three subgroups of PEDV coexisted in Sichuan province, and the S-INDEL strain was detected in Guizhou. Further antigenic variation analysis of the neutralizing epitopes (S10, COE, SS2, SS6 and 2C10) on the spike protein revealed that the S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains shared similar variation features in COE and SS6, but exhibited distinct variation patterns in the S10 domain. Unique variation patterns on N-glycosylation sites in the S protein were also observed for the S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains. Moreover, nine strains (three from each subgroup) were subjected to full-genome characterization. Complete genome phylogeny showed an inconsistent tree topology for genotyping, with two G2c strains grouped into the GII-b (AH2012-like) genogroup and the remaining seven strains including three S-INDEL strains grouped into the GII-c genogroup. Further recombination analyses indicated that six of the GII-c strains probably originated from intra-genogroup recombinations. Notably, three newly emerged S-INDEL strains with novel recombination patterns were first identified. Together, our data revealed a new status of PEDV in southwest China, which can increase understanding of the prevalence, genetic characteristics and evolutionary profiles of circulating PEDV strains in China.

AB What is known and objective Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as one of the most exciting new treatments for patients with certain types of cancer. Haematologic toxicities are common adverse events (AEs) for all PARP inhibitors. We conducted a meta-analysis to fully investigate the haematologic toxicities of PARP inhibitors in cancer patients.
   Study design PubMed/Medline and Embase were searched for articles published till September 2020. The relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with PARP inhibitors were retrieved, and the systematic evaluation was performed.
   Results Twenty-nine RCTs and 9247 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of PARP inhibitors significantly increases the risk of all-grade anaemia (RR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.78-3.01; p < 0.00001), neutropenia (RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.38-2.07; p < 0.00001) and thrombocytopenia (RR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.87-3.45; p < 0.00001). The use of these agents also significantly increased the risk of high-grade anaemia (RR, 3.06; 95% CI, 2.11-4.43; p < 0.00001), neutropenia (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33-2.07; p < 0.00001) and thrombocytopenia (RR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.83-4.16; p < 0.00001). Anaemia was the most common haematologic toxicity, and all the five included PARP inhibitors were associated with a significant increased risk of anaemia. Combination treatment may reduce the risk of anaemia and thrombocytopenia compared to those receiving PARP inhibitor monotherapy.
   What is new and conclusion The available data suggested that the use of PARP inhibitors was associated with a significantly increased risk of haematologic toxicities.

AB Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it.

AB Guided by the UPLC-ESIMS profile, seven previously undescribed halogenated dihydroisocoumarins, palmaerones A-G, along with eleven known dihydroisocoumarins, were isolated from Lachnum palmae, an endophytic fungus from Przewalskia tangutica by exposure to a histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA. Structures of the isolates were elucidated by analysis of their NMR, MS and optical rotation values. The antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of palmaerones A-G were evaluated. Palmaerones A-G showed antimicrobial activities against the strains (C. neoformans, Penicillium sp., C. albicans, B. subtilis and S. aureus), and palmaerone E exhibited potential antimicrobial activities against all the test strains with the MIC value in the range of 10-55 mu g/mL. Palmaerones A and E exhibited moderate inhibitory effects on NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, with the IC50 values of 26.3 and 38.7 mu M, respectively and no obvious toxicities were observed at 50 mu M. Palmaerone E showed weak cytotoxicity against HepG2 with the IC50 value of 42.8 mu M. This work provides an effective strategy for expanding natural product resource. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbon nanoparticles suspension injection (CNSI) has been widely used in tumor drainage lymph node mapping, and its new applications in drug delivery, photothermal therapy, and so on have been extensively investigated. To develop new clinical applications, the toxicity of CNSI after intravenous exposure should be thoroughly investigated to ensure its safe use. Herein, we studied the bioaccumulation of CNSI in reticuloendothelial system (RES) organs and the corresponding toxicity to mice. After the intravenous injection of CNSI, no abnormal behavior of mice was observed during the 28-day observation period. The body weight increases were similar among the exposed groups and the control group. The parameters of hematology and serum biochemistry remained nearly unchanged, with very few of them showing significant changes. The low toxicity of CNSI was also reflected by the unchanged histopathological characteristics of these organs. The injection of CNSI did not induce higher apoptosis levels either. The slight oxidative stress was observed in RES organs at high dosages at day 7 post-exposure. The implication to the clinical applications and toxicological evaluations of carbon nanomaterials is discussed.

AB Background and Purpose: Polygonum orientale L. (family: Polygonaceae), named Hongcao in China, is a Traditional Chinese Medicinal and has long been used for rheumatic arthralgia and rheumatoid arthritis. However, no pharmacological and mechanism study to confirm these clinic effects have been published. In this investigation, the anti-inflammatory, analgesic effects and representative active ingredient compounds of P. orientale have been studied.
   Methods: Dried small pieces of the stems and leaves of P. orientale were decocted with water and partitioned successively to obtain ethyl acetate and ethyl ether extract of P. orientale (POEa and POEe). Chemical compositions of them were analyzed by UPLC-Q-Exactive HRMS. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of POEa and POEe were evaluated using xylene induced ear edema, carrageenan induced paw edema, Freunds' complete adjuvant induced arthritis, and formaldehyde induced pain in rat. Their mechanisms of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects were also studied via assays of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and PGE2 in serum.
   Results: UPLC-Q-Exactive HRMS analysis showed that POEa and POEe mainly contained flavonoids including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, luteolin, and quercetin. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects of POEa and POEe were evident in xylene induced ear edema. The paw edema in Freund's complete adjuvant and carrageenan were significantly (P < 0.05, 0.01) inhibited by POEa (5, 7.5 g/kg). POEe (7.5 g/kg) was significantly (P < 0.05, 0.01) inhibited Freunds' complete adjuvant induced paw edema and cotton pellet induced granuloma formation. Similarly, POEe significantly (P < 0.05, 0.01) inhibited the pain sensation in acetic acid induced writhing test. POEa (5, 7.5 g/kg) significantly (P < 0.05, 0.01) inhibited formaldehyde induced pain in both phases. POEa (7.5 g/kg) markedly (P < 0.05) prolonged the latency period of hot plate test after 30 and 60 min. The concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and PGE2 were significantly (P < 0.01) decreased by POEa (3.75, 5 g/kg).
   Conclusion: POEa and POEe have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, which was mainly relevant to the presence of flavonoids, including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, luteolin, and quercetin. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of POEa may be to decrease the concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and PGE2 in serum.

AB In order to improve the antibacterial activities while decrease the cytotoxity of silver nanoparticles, we prepared a novel nanocomposites composed of silver nanoparticles decorated lipase-sensitive polyurethane micelles (PUM-Ag) with MPEG brush on the surface. The nanocomposite was characterized by UV-vis, TEM and DLS. UV-vis and TEM demonstrated the formation of silver nanoparticles on PU micelles and the nanoassembly remained intact without the presence of lipase. The silver nanoparticles were protected by the polymer matrix and PEG brush which show good cytocompatibility to HUVEC cells and low hemolysis. Moreover, at the presence of lipase, the polymer matrix of nanocomposites is subject to degradation and the small silver nanoparticles were released as is shown by DLS and TEM. The MIC and MBC studies showed an enhanced toxicity of the nanocomposites to both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, i.e. E. coli and S. aureus, as the result of the degradation of polymer matrix by bacterial lipase. Therefore, the nanocomposites are biocompatible to mammalian cells cells which can also lead to activated smaller silver nanoparticles release at the presence of bacteria and subsequently enhanced inhibition of bacteria growth. The satisfactory selectivity for bacteria compared to HUVEC and RBCs make PUM-Ag a promising antibacterial nanomedicine in biomedical field. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oral delivery of nano-drug delivery systems (Nano-DDS) remains a challenge. Taking inspirations from viruses, here we construct core-shell mesoporous silica nanoparticles (NPs, ~80 nm) with virus-like nanospikes (VSN) to simulate viral morphology, and further modified VSN with L-alanine (CVSN) to enable chiral recognition for functional bionics. By comparing with the solid silica NPs, mesoporous silica NPs and VSN, we demonstrate the delivery advantages of CVSN on overcoming intestinal sequential barriers in both animals and human via multiple biological processes. Subsequently, we encapsulate indomethacin (IMC) into the nanopores of NPs to mimic gene package, wherein the payloads are isolated from bio-environments and exist in an amorphous form to increase their stability and solubility, while the chiral nanospikes multi-sited anchor and chiral recognize on the intestinal mucosa to enhance the penetrability and ultimately improve the oral adsorption of IMC. Encouragingly, we also prove the versatility of CVSN as oral Nano-DDS.

AB Mechanistic understanding of electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is important for designing efficient AOR catalysts. In this work, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) is employed to study the AOR at varied potentials on an Ir electrode in alkaline media. The AOR on Ir contains two sequential oxidation peaks in the anodic voltammograms. The in situ ATR-SEIRAS results indicate that the small Peak I at a lower potential is mainly due to dehydrogenation of interfacial ammonia and dimerization of as-generated NHx,ad species to N2Hx+y,ad species. And the broad and intense Peak II at a higher potential mainly involves the N-2 production from N2Hx+y,ad species, NOad species generation from NHx, ad species and further successive oxidation into the NO2- and NO3- by-products at higher potentials. It is thus inferred that NHx species are the pivotal intermediates for AOR on Ir electrode, and the N2Hx+y,ad and NOad species the key intermediates for the production of N-2, NO2- and NO3-, respectively.

AB As antimicrobial agents, essential oils (EOs) have been used by more and more companies as alternatives to traditional chemicals. In the study, seven EOs from Pinus massoniana, cinnamon, Star anise, Litsea cubeba, Cinnamomum camphora, Lemon eucalyptus, and Camphor from Guangxi were researched for their antifungal performances and chemical components. With the help of the diffusion in a disc way as well as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to three fungi, the antifungal impacts and the bamboo slices anti-mold tests of these EOs were studied. The compositions of these oils were identified. Litsea cubeba EO, Anise EO, and Cinnamon EO exhibited super antifungal activity against Trichoderma viride, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium citrinum. Treated by Cinnamon EO, Anise EO, or Litsea cubeba EO, few molds were observed on the surface of bamboo chips, which showed that these EOs had a good antifungal effect on molds of bamboo.

AB (1-x)(Bi0.51Na0.47)(0.94)Ba0.06TiO3-xSm(1/3)TaO(3) ceramics (abbreviated as BNTBT-xST) were fabricated by a con-ventional sintering technique, and their energy storage, dielectric and ferroelectric properties were investigated. With the doping of Sm3+ and Ta5+, the ceramics maintain the phase structure in which tetragonal (T) and rhombohedral (R) phases coexist. Moreover, after the introduction of ST, the grain size is reduced and the ferroelectric long-range order is broken, which contribute to the improvement in energy storage properties. Especially, the BNTBT-0.05ST ceramic achieves the excellent charging energy density (W-cha) of 1.90 J cm(-3), discharging energy density (W-dis) of 1.59 J cm(-3) and discharging efficiency (eta) of 84.2% under a low applied electric field (E) of 125 kV cm(-1). More importantly, the ceramic also possesses superior durability of frequency (10 Hz-80 Hz) and temperature (25 degrees C-175 degrees C).

AB Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major etiological pathogens of bovine mastitis. Its invasion into mammary epithelial cells has been proven to be a key event in the pathogenesis of mastitis. However, the specific pathogenic factors have not been clearly identified. Staphylococcus aureus often triggers infections by releasing virulence factor. Recent several studies reported that staphylococcal enterotoxin M was one of the most frequently found enterotoxin genes associated with bovine mastitis. Thus, the effect of staphylococcal enterotoxin M on inflammation and damage of the bovine mammary epithelial bovine mammary gland epithelial cell line (MAC-T) cells with 48 h treatment was explored in the present study. First, staphylococcal enterotoxin M protein was purified by a Ni-NTA spin column (GE Life Science, Westborough, MA). The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) secretion were measured with the corresponding ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Second, cell viability was assessed with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Bioswamp, Wuhan, China) and the apoptotic percentage of cells was determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI; Beyotime, Nanjing, China) staining. Third, ATP concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were assayed with commercial kits, then mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) was estimated using fluorescent probe JC-1 (Beyotime). Finally, the production intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 I/II (LC3 I/II), p62 (Proteintech, Rosemont, IL), and phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha, caspase 3, and mammalian target of rapamycin were detected by Western blot. The results showed that staphylococcal enterotoxin M induced inflammation of epithelial cells (upregulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 production) and activated NF-kappa B (promoting phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha). Furthermore, staphylococcal enterotoxin M impaired MAC-T cells via cell necrosis (enhancing LDH release), apoptosis (annexin V-FITC/PI stain, exacerbating oxidative stress, decreasing Delta psi m and intracellular ATP concentration, and activating caspase 3), but independent of autophagy (nonsignificantly increasing LC3-II, decreasing p62 expression, and activating mammalian target of rapamycin). Thereby, staphylococcal enterotoxin M induced the inflammatory property of bovine mammary epithelial cells by boosting cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule production. Furthermore, it caused epithelial cell dysfunction via depressing cell viability and initiating cell necrosis and apoptosis. Because epithelial cells played important roles in orchestrating the inflammatory response and protecting bovine mammary tissue from mastitis, our results indicated that staphylococcal enterotoxin M may be associated with mastitis.

AB Cancer is a leading cause of death around the world. Apoptosis, one of the pathways of programmed cell death, is a promising target for cancer therapy. Traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM) has been used by Tibetan people for thousands of years, and many TTMs have been proven to be effective in the treatment of cancer. This paper summarized the medicinal plants with anticancer activity in the Tibetan traditional system of medicine by searching for Tibetan medicine monographs and drug standards and reviewing modern research literatures. Forty species were found to be effective in treating cancer. More importantly, some TTMs (e.g.,Ophiocordyceps sinensis,Phyllanthus emblicaL. andRhodiola kirilowii(Regel) Maxim.) and their active ingredients (e.g., cordycepin, salidroside, and gallic acid) have been reported to possess anticancer activity by targeting some apoptosis pathways in cancer, such as Bcl-2/Bax, caspases, PI3K/Akt, JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, and AMPK. These herbs and natural compounds would be potential drug candidates for the treatment of cancer.

AB Li-oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their superior energy density. However, the questions of large overpotential and poor cycling stability caused by sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics are remain. Here, we propose that constructing heterostructured nanomaterials with high conductivity is an effective way to enhance the eletrocatalytic activity in LOBs. The core-shell Pd@Pd4S heterostructures decorated on the porous carbon matrix are successfully fabricated by adopting hypo (Na2S2O3 center dot 5H(2)O) as a sulfidation reactant in a simple method, which is used as an oxygen cathode for LOBs for the first time. The hierarchical regular pore structure in Pd@Pd4S-C with a high surface area offers sufficient Li2O2 accommodations, which can facilitate a higher capacity and achieving a longer cycle life. The introduction of the Pd4S shell greatly boosts decomposition of Li2O2, which effectively decreases the overpotentials, and contributes to the outstanding cycling stability of Pd@Pd4S-C electrode (176 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1)). This novel heterostructure fabrication method highlights the importance of efficient O-2-electrode designs and provides a facile way to optimize the cathode materials for LOBs.

AB Surface modification of Fe3O4 is an efficient strategy to improve its Fenton-like catalytic activity. In this study, the dispersible Fe3O4 cores were coated with SiO2 and C to prepare Fe3O4/SiO2/C nanospheres (FSCNS) for Fenton-like catalysis. FSCNS showed high catalytic activity in the pH range of 4-9. The dispersible formulation made FSCNS more efficient than aggregated Fe3O4/SiO2/C nanocomposites. Increasing the FSCNS amount, H2O2 concentration and temperature would accelerate the Fenton-like reaction. The radicals generated in the Fenton-like reaction was used for the decoloration of cationic dye methylene blue and showed good tolerance to radical scavenger t-butanol. After decoloration, FSCNS could be easily washed for regeneration. The implication to the applications of FSCNS in water treatment is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The source region of the Yellow River, China,, experienced degradation during the 1980s and 1990s, but effective ecological restoration projects have restored the alpine grassland ecosystem: The local government has taken action to restore the grassland area since 1996. Remote sensing monitoring results show an initial restoration of this alpine grassland ecosystem with the structural transformation of land cover from 2000 to 2009 as low- and high-coverage grassland recovered. From 2000 to 2009, the low-coverage grassland area expanded by over 25% and the bare soil area decreased by approximately 15%. To examine the relationship between ecological structure and function, surface temperature (T-s) and evapotranspiration (PT) levels were estimated to study the dynamics of the hydro-heat pattern. The results show a turning point in approximately the year 2000 from a declining ET to a rising ET, eventually reaching the 1990 level of approximately 1.5 cm/day. We conclude that grassland coverage expansion has improved the regional hydrologic cycle as a consequence of ecological restoration. Thus, we suggest that long-term restoration and monitoring efforts would help maintain the climatic adjustment functions of this alpine grassland ecosystem.

AB Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease with diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon. A topical drug delivery system that could be facilely performed and efficiently retained at colon are attractive for clinical ulcerative colitis treatment. Herein, a novel platform for rectal administration of thermosensitive hydrogel coloaded with nanoparticles to treat ulcerative colitis was developed. Thiolated-hyaluronic acid was synthesized, and prepared nanoparticles with zein and Puerarin. And the Bletilla striata polysaccharide with colonic mucosa repair effect was oxidized, and mixed with chitosan and beta-sodium glycerophosphate to prepare thermosensitive hydrogel. Thermosensitive hydrogels were combined with nanoparticles to investigate their mucosal adhesion, retention, and permeability, as well as their therapeutic effects on ulcerative colitis. Thiolatedhyaluronic acid nanoparticles had good stability, and could be quickly converted into hydrogel at body temperature when combined with thermosensitive hydrogel. The nanoparticles-loaded thermosensitive hydrogel also was excellent at mucosal penetration, enhancing the retention time of drugs in colon, and effectively controlling drug release. In vivo ulcerative colitis treatment revealed that the nanoparticles-loaded hydrogel significantly repaired the colonic mucosa and inhibit colonic inflammation. Therefore, the thermosensitive hydrogel co-loaded nanoparticles will have a promising application in effective treatment of ulcerative colitis by topical administration.

AB Selective electrocatalytic conversion via ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) at abundant Iron-group catalysts could be a promising and sustainable approach to produce value-added C1 and C2 chemicals. However, the corresponding intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of EGOR on Iron-group electrodes are still ambiguous, which is urgent to be revealed. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) results show that Co and Ni rather than Fe exhibit considerably high activity, and the CoIV and NiIII sites formed at high potential might be crucial for the fast EGOR revealed by LSV and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Then, the in-situ electrochemical infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used to obtain a general understanding of reaction pathways and product distributions in alkaline media. Specifically, a parallel C1 pathway (formate) without CO2 generation and C2 pathway (glycollate, oxalate) is confirmed on Co and Ni surfaces. The C1 pathway is dominated on the Ni surface with a -60% selectivity of formate, while the C2 pathway is favorable on the Co surface with a -43% selectivity of glycollate at 1.60 V vs. RHE. In addition, the Ni electrode showed a higher yield rate of carboxylate products. This work may offer theoretical guidance for the design of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts towards efficient selective electrooxidation of EG to value-added chemicals.

AB The success of liquid/solid-state batteries is fundamentally determined by the electrode microstructures, which is particularly true for high-energy-density electrodes with either thick configuration or high-capacity active materials. Unfortunately, high-energy-density electrodes usually suffer from fast performance degradation due to various challenging issues in microstructures. Therefore, a better understanding of electrode microstructures and the strategies toward optimizing them are in urgent need by the research community and battery industries. In this review, the authors attempt to rethink and comprehensively understand the multiscale microstructures for particularly thick electrodes and to summarize the corresponding structuring strategies. Specifically, in analogy to proteins, the multiscale electrode microstructures are classified into the primary structures of rigid building blocks, the secondary structures of active material microenvironment, and the tertiary structures of electrode architectures. Meanwhile, the design principles and structuring strategies at different levels of microstructures are detailed with consideration given to efficiency, energy consumption, eco-friendliness, and scalability. Finally, a concept of a battery manufacturing genome based on structuring strategy profile (similar to amino acid profile) is proposed as the forthcoming opportunity for the future connection of machine learning with battery microstructure optimization, which may promote the development of next-generation on-demand batteries.

TI The biogeography of relative abundance of soil fungi versus bacteria in

AB Fungi and bacteria are the two dominant groups of soil microbial communities worldwide. By controlling the turnover of soil organic matter, these organisms directly regulate the cycling of carbon between the soil and the atmosphere. Fundamental differences in the physiology and life history of bacteria and fungi suggest that variation in the biogeography of relative abundance of soil fungi versus bacteria could drive striking differences in carbon decomposition and soil organic matter formation between different biomes. However, a lack of global and predictive information on the distribution of these organisms in terrestrial ecosystems has prevented the inclusion of relative abundance of soil fungi versus bacteria and the associated processes in global biogeochemical models. Here, we used a global-scale dataset of > 3000 distinct observations of abundance of soil fungi versus bacteria in the surface topsoil (up to 15 cm) to generate the first quantitative and high-spatialresolution (1 km(2)) explicit map of soil fungal proportion, defined as fungi/fungi + bacteria, across terrestrial ecosystems. We reveal striking latitudinal trends where fungal dominance increases in cold and high-latitude environments with large soil carbon stocks. There was a strong nonlinear response of fungal dominance to the environmental gradient, i.e., mean annual temperature (MAT) and net primary productivity (NPP). Fungi dominated in regions with low MAT and NPP and bacteria dominated in regions with high MAT and NPP, thus representing slow vs. fast soil energy channels, respectively, a concept with a long history in soil ecology. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing the major soil microbial groups and their functional differences in global biogeochemical models to improve predictions of soil organic matter turnover under current and future climate scenarios. Raw datasets and global maps generated in this study are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19556419 (Yu, 2022).

AB Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is commonly used for the identification of Alzheimer's disease because of its keen insight into atrophy-induced changes in brain structure. Current mainstream convolutional neural network-based deep learning methods ignore the long-term dependencies between voxels; thus, it is challenging to learn the global features of sMRI data. In this study, an advanced deep learning architecture called Brain Informer (BraInf) was developed based on an efficient self-attention mechanism. The proposed model integrates representation learning, feature distilling, and classifier modeling into a unified framework. First, the proposed model uses a multihead ProbSparse self-attention block for representation learning. This self-attention mechanism selects the first left perpendicularlnNright perpendicular elements that can represent the overall features from the perspective of probability sparsity, which significantly reduces computational cost. Subsequently, a structural distilling block is proposed that applies the concept of patch merging to the distilling operation. The block reduces the size of the three-dimensional tensor and further lowers the memory cost while preserving the original data as much as possible. Thus, there was a significant improvement in the space complexity. Finally, the feature vector was projected into the classification target space for disease prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model was validated using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The model achieved 97.97% and 91.89% accuracy on Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment classification tasks, respectively. The experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Surfactant-free Pickering emulsion has been considered as a promising carrier to load oil-soluble active agents for preparation of active edible films to keep food quality and safety. Herein, dialdehyde cellulose nanocrystals (DCNC) were obtained by the periodate oxidation. Then, the DCNC-stabilized Pickering emulsion loaded with dihydromyricetin was prepared and incorporated into gelatin matrix to fabricate gelatin-based active edible films. Interestingly, DCNC was used to cross-link gelatin, besides stabilizing Pickering emulsion, to effectively improve the physicochemical properties of gelatin-based films. The results indicate that the Pickering emulsion stabilized by DCNC3 (DCNC3-DP) is quite stable during storage and centrifugation. And DCNC3-DP was homogeneously dispersed in gelatin films. Significantly, the gelatin-based active edible films incorporated with DCNC3-DP have strong UV barrier ability, high transparency, good water resistance, favorable mechanical property, and effective antioxidant activity. Overall, the as-prepared gelatin-based active edible films have advantages in the application of food and drug packaging.

AB Although potassium-sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics with good piezoelectric performance have been obtained by a phase engineering strategy, a low electric field-induced strain (<0.2%) even when applying large electric fields is observed in the ceramics prepared by normal sintering, which hardly satisfies practical application demands. Here, a ternary lead-free material system of (0.965 - x)K0.5Na0.5Nb0.975Sb0.25O3-0.035Bi(0.5)Na(0.5)ZrO(3)-xBiFeO(3) (KNNS-BNZ-xBF, 0 <= x <= 0.008) ceramics with excellent overall performance has been designed, aiming to achieve balanced development between piezoelectric and strain properties. A systematic study of the phase structure, electric properties and temperature stability is carried out on the ceramics, and the optimal electric properties (e.g., d(33) approximate to 511 pC N-1, S-uni approximate to 0.202%, d(33)* approximate to 505 pm V-1, and T-c approximate to 269 degrees C) are obtained at x = 0.007 owing to the large tetragonality and R-T phase structure with low polarization anisotropy as well as weak energy barriers. Moreover, a new approach used to evaluate coercivity (E-c) qualitatively provides more choices to identify E-c in ferroelectrics. We believe that it may promote the application of lead-free piezoelectric materials.

AB Fe2+-H2O2 Fenton system is the most applied system in advanced oxidation process for water remediation, but the drawbacks of acidic pH, sludge generation and poor regeneration are serious problems to overcome. Herein, we reported the Fe3O4/TiO2/reduced graphene oxide composites (RGO) as high-performance Fenton-like catalyst that could catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 in near neutral pH range of 5-9 for the decoloration of dye methylene blue (MB). The high catalytic activity of Fe3O4/TiO2/RGO was reflected by the fast absorbance decrease and chemical oxidation demand removal of MB solution within 20 min. The oxidation of MB was due to the radical generation in the Fe3O4/TiO2/RGO-H2O2 system, and the radicals could oxidize MB before the scavenging by the radical scavenger t-butanol. Higher Fe3O4/TiO2/RGO amount, H2O2 concentration and temperature accelerated the decoloration of MB. Fe3O4/TiO2/RGO could be easily regenerated by washing with water/ethanol mixture. The implication to the applications of Fe3O4/TiO2/RGO in water treatment is discussed.

AB A few recent studies indicate that grit, the perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has a positive association with subjective well-being. However, less is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying this association. Here, we tested the role of mindfulness in mediating this association in Chinese adolescents who attended high schools. In Study 1 (N = 1262), we first verified the association between the grit and subjective well-being, given that this association has not been reported in the Chinese population. Consistent with the previous literature, higher levels of grit were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, more positive affect, and less negative affect. In Study 2 (N = 627), we replicated the association between grit and subjective well-being. More importantly, mediation analyses demonstrated that the association was partly mediated by mindfulness. Together, our findings suggest that the grit may help boost adolescents' subjective well-being through their mindful mind in pursuing their long-term goals.

AB A potentially functional yogurt co-fermentation with Gnaphalium affine was prepared and its quality and antioxidant properties were investigated. According to the classic procedure, a novel yogurt was successfully prepared with Gnaphalium affine extract (EGA). During the storage period, the pH value and titratable acidity of yogurt showed no obvious changes compared with control. However, the texture properties of yogurt, such as firmness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness and springiness, could be effectively improved. Moreover, the yogurt possessed the lower syneresis susceptibility and higher viability of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus than the control. Furthermore, the yogurt showed remarkable antioxidant potential to scavenge 2, 2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. Meanwhile, the yogurt could enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and it could also lead to a significant decrease of malondialdehyde (MDA) level in animal serums. The current results suggest that the yogurt co-fermentation with EGA possesses high quality properties and remarkable antioxidant potential, and thus has the great potential to be used as a novel functional food product in food industry.

AB A facile co-precipitation approach combined with spray-drying and high-temperature calcinations was developed to synthesize LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C microspheres on a large scale. With an open porous structure, these microspheres are composed of nanoparticles coated with a carbon layer. The electrochemical performances of a LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C cathode were investigated with a water-soluble adhesive, polyacrylic latex (LA133), and compared with the commercial polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The results show that LA133 makes better distribution between the microspheres and acetylene black with a larger and closer contact and stronger adherence. The testing results show that the LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C demonstrates a reversible capacity of 161 mA h g(-1). The electrodes with the LA133 adhesive attain higher discharge capacities than the electrodes with PVDF at a large current density, and deliver a long cycle life of 500 cycles at 5C with an excellent capacity retention ratio of 70.5% at room temperature. Even at a low temperature of 0 degrees C, the LiMn0.8Fe0.2PO4/C electrodes with LA133 retain a capacity of 117 mA h g(-1) and stability.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) had meaningful adsorption capacities for Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, while Pb2+ showed the highest adsorption in the competitive adsorption evaluations. The desorption behaviors of heavy metal ions were completely different in various biofluids, where the desorption was significantly influenced by pH and the presence of proteins/other cations. The desorption was most effective in simulated stomach juice, and much less effective in other simulated biofluids. More Pb2+ stuck to CNTs than others, resulting in less desorption. Interestingly, the competitive desorption behaviors of four ions were largely changed comparing to the individual desorption behaviors. The implications to the biosafety evaluations and synergistic effects of CNT are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pectin is one of the fascinating naturally occurring plant polysaccharides. The unique structural elements endow pectin with emulsifying property, stabilizing effect, and capacity to increase the viscosity of aqueous phase. Thus, the trend of using pectin as wall material for nano delivery application has been rapidly developed. This review article presents recent advances (2016???2022) in the utilization of pectin in the construction of various emerging nanocarriers, including polyelectrolyte nanocomplexes, protein-pectin core-shell nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, and nanofibers. These nanocarriers can exhibit an improved protection, stability, and controlled release of bioactive compounds. Better efficacy can be achieved through combining pectin with other bio-polymers such as proteins. Here, we discuss the preparation methods, formation, structure, and properties of each nanocarrier. The focus is on the applications and challenges for delivery of bioactive compounds in the functional food field. This review may give an insight of understanding and potential of pectin-derived nano -encapsulating systems to obtain higher bioavailability and heathy benefits of bioactive compounds.

AB As a kind of soft smart material, hydrogel actuators have extensive development prospects, but it is still difficult for these actuators to integrate multiresponsiveness, multiple remote actuation, high strength, fast responsiveness, and programmable complex deformation. Herein, we have explored an anisotropic bilayer hydrogel actuator with an Fe3O4/co-poly(isopropylacrylamide-4-benzoylphenyl acrylate) [Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP)] active layer and an isotropic conductive adhesive (ICAs) passive layer based on the layer-by-layer method. Benefiting from the fibrosis and porosity of the Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) hydrogel, the ICAs-Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) hydrogel actuator has excellent mechanical strength (tensile strength of 3.1 +/- 0.3 MPa) and response speed (temperature (45 degrees C): bending speed of 2400.3 degrees/s; near-infrared (NIR) light: bending speed of 356.4 degrees/s; electricity (2 V): bending speed of 180 degrees/s; water (10 degrees C): recovery speed of 30.0 degrees/s). In addition, the good photothermal properties and magnetic conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles provide precise remotely controllable light- and magnetic-actuated properties for the hydrogel actuator. The Ag microsheets with excellent conductivity (1.4 x 104 S/cm) provide remotely controllable electrical-actuated property for the hydrogel actuator. Combined with the responsiveness of P(NIPAM-ABP), the actuator can achieve short-range actuation including temperature-, ethanol-, and salt-responses. More importantly, it can achieve remote actuation including light, electrical, and magnetic responses. Finally, the Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) fibers can provide excellent anisotropic structures for the actuator to achieve precise deformational programmability. Inspired by some phenomena in nature, several actuating devices with the above characteristics have been successfully developed. This study can provide a general method for multifunctional anisotropic hydrogel actuators and will provide a new strategy for exploring smart materials suitable for complex bioinspired systems.

AB This study examines how the relationship between self-esteem (both trait self-esteem and state self-esteem) and goal-framing messages can affect individuals' visit intentions on the basis of user-generated advertising. An analysis of variance revealed that the visit intentions of participants with low (vs. high) self-esteem were more influenced by loss-framing (vs. gain-framing) messages; meanwhile, gain-framing (vs. loss-framing) messages resulted in stronger destination visit intentions among participants with high (vs. low) self-esteem. This reasearch also investigated the successive mediating roles of emotional arousal (EA) and attitude towards a destination in the above mechanism. When individuals with high (vs. low) self-esteem were exposed to gain-framing (vs. loss-framing) messages, they exhibited stronger EA, thus inspiring more enthusiastic destination attitudes and stronger destination visit intentions. Theoretical and managerial implications for destination managers and website designers are provided.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of compound probiotics (consisting of 108 cfu/g of Lactobacillus plantarum, 108 cfu/g of Pediococcus acidilactici, 108 cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus, 107 cfu/g of and Bacillus subtilis) on growth performance, rumen fermentation, bacteria community, blood parameters, and health status of Holstein calves at the first 3 mo of age. Forty-eight newborn calves were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: control group (milk replacer with no compound probiotics), low compound probiotics group (milk replacer + 0.12 g of compound probiotics per head per day), and high compound probiotics group (HP; milk replacer + 1.2 g of compound probiotics per head per day). Starter pellets of the low compound probiotics and HP groups were coated with 0.05% compound probiotics. Milk replacer was provided from 2 to 63 d of age (6 L at 2-10 d, 8 L at 11-42 d, 6 L at 43-49 d, 4 L at 50-56 d, and 2 L at 57-63 d), and starter pellets were provided ad libitum from 7 to 90 d of age. Body weight and body size (d 1, 30, 60, and 90), blood (d 40 and 80), and rumen fluid (d 90) were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA procedure; fecal score was recorded daily and analyzed as repeated mea-sures using the mixed model procedure. Results showed that diet supplemented with compound probiotics had no effects on the body weight, average daily gain, dry matter intake, and feed efficiency. At 90 d of age, diet supplemented with compound probiotics decreased the withers height. Immunity activities increased in the HP group, supported by the increased concentrations of se-rum total protein and immunoglobulins at 40 d of age, and by the increased activity of superoxide dismutase at 80 d of age. Diet supplemented with compound probiotics altered rumen fermentation, indicated by the decreased rumen acetic acid and propionic acid, and the increased butyric acid concentrations. Diet supplemented with compound probiotics improved the health status of calves, indicated by the decreased fecal score at 3 wk of age and the decreased medicine treatments. In summary, although diet supplemented with HP decreased the withers height, this level of probiotics is recommended to improve rumen development and health status of newborn Holstein calves.

AB Land desertification directly impacts the services and functions of grassland ecosystems globally, especially in alpine regions. Ecological restoration measures (e.g., erecting fences, establishing plant barriers, and planting native shrubs and grasses) are essential for combating desertification and restoring functions of degraded alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, the combined effects of ecological restoration measures on the plant-soil system have yet to be systematically evaluated and compared in the alpine-cold semi-humid area. In this study, we compared vegetation and soil properties upon the application of three typical restoration measures [i.e., fencing enclosure (FE), establishing Salix cupularis sandy barrier (SCSB), and establishing Salix cupularis sandy barrier plus planting grasses (SCSBPPG)], along with severely degraded sandy land as a control (CK). Soil physicochemical (i.e., particle-size distribution, water content (SWC), bulk density (SBD), soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK)), and microbiological properties [i.e., microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN), phosphorus (MBP), urease, dehydrogenase, catalase, acid phosphatase, polyphenol oxidase, and beta-glucosidase activities] were measured in soil layers at depths of 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm. The results showed that the vegetation coverage, aboveground biomass, Margalef richness index, and Shannon-Weiner diversity index significantly increased by 13.54, 13, 3.09, and 1.80 times with FE, and by 11.24, 10.50, 1.05, and 0.83 times with SCSBPPG, respectively (P < 0.05), in comparison to CK. At the same time, SCSB had no significant influence on these four indexes. In addition, the most pronounced improvements of soil clay content, SOM, TN, and TP occurred in the 10-20 cm soil layer, with enhancements by 419%, 243.62%, 93.94%, and 68.97% in FE, and by 73%, 118.46%, 45.45%, and 41.38% in SCSBPPG, respectively. Moreover, MBC and the activities of urease, dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and polyphenol oxidase were higher with the artificial recovery interventions than those in CK, with the most significant increases found in 10-20 cm at 22.04%, 44.80%, 46.84%, 44.58%, and 87.50% for FE, and 17.85%, 34.30%, 47.43%, 31.78%, and 41.85% for SCSBPPG, respectively. Finally, SCSB significantly decreased the SOM, TN, TP, MBC, MBN, MBP, and the activities of urease, dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase, and p-glucosidase. Our study showed that FE is an efficient management measure for restoring semi-fixed dunes. Combining this with planting grasses and shrubs, rather than establishing plant barriers, is recommended to restore moving dunes in alpine-cold semi-humid sandy regions. This research can provide a reference for optimizing the ecological restoration measures and designing sustainable environmental strategies for conserving grassland at risk of desertification in QTP, China.

AB Renewable bamboo materials have broad application prospects in the fields of structural construction, insulation and acoustic management due to their multi-layer porous structure, attractive directional layout texture, ultra-fast growth rate, and excellent mechanical strength. However, the annual loss of bamboo material due to the microbial corrosion accounts for one-tenth of the total output. In this work, the hydrophobic associating hydrogel (HAH) with chitosan (CS) and zinc oxide (ZnO) has been in situ filled in the micro-nano-scale pores of natural bamboo materials to significantly enhance their anti-microbial fouling performance. It is difficult for the mildew and oxygen in the air to come into the bamboo materials due to the artificial hydrogel barrier layer. CS and ZnO nanomaterials further increase the anti-bacterial rate of bamboo composites to 100%. Based on the physical crosslinking between the polyacrylamide (PMA) of HAH hydrogel and natural bamboo fibers, CS and ZnO bacteriostatic media are not easy to be lost from the bamboo materials. The 100% anti-bacterial rate of the bamboo composite materials can be maintained for at least 56 days. Therefore, the bamboo composites have great application potential as building materials in the future.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and modern pharmacodynamics, dried Rehmannia Radix (DRR) possesses prominent anti-thrombotic activity that decreases after processing by nine steaming and drying cycles to develop processed Rehmannia Radix (PRR). Due to the complexity of the DRR components, the chemical mechanism leading to efficacy changes of DRR caused by processing is still unclear. Aim of study: This study aimed to trace the anti-thrombotic active compounds of DRR and different degrees of processed RR (PRR) and to evaluate the synergistic effects among different active components.
   Materials and methods: The anti-thrombotic active chemical fraction of DRR extracts was evaluated. Targeted fractions of the processed products of RR were prepared at different processing stages. The changes in monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and secondary metabolites during processing were characterized by multidimensional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The anti-thrombotic effects of targeted fractions of different RR samples were evaluated by analyzing the length of tail thrombus (LT) and serum biochemical indicators in carrageenan-induced tail-thrombus mice. The spectrum-effect relationships were investigated by partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis and gray correlation analysis (GRA). Finally, the active compounds were screened by spectrum-effect relationship analysis and validated in vivo, and their synergistic effects were determined by Webb's fraction multiplication method. Results: Six ingredients highly associated with anti-thrombotic activities were screened out by the spectrum-effect relationship analysis, of which oligosaccharides (stachyose, sucrose and raffinose) and iridoid glycosides (catalpol, leonuride and melitoside) possessed a synergistic effect on tumor necrosis factors (TNF-alpha), interleukin 113 (IL-113) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)/tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) ratio in vivo with synergistic coefficient (SC) > 1.
   Conclusion: The main material basis of the anti-thrombotic activities of DRR is oligosaccharide components of stachyose, raffinose and sucrose, iridoid glycosides components of catalpol, leonuride and melittoside. The two kinds of components exert synergistic anti-thrombotic effects by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors and regulating the balance of the fibrinolysis system.

AB Recently, photonic synapses that can directly respond to light signals have attracted much attention due to their huge application potential in neuromorphic chips and artificial vision systems. However, the implementation of an artificial visual system based on a synapse remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation that most current photonic synapses fail to recognize color. Here, a photonic synapse with color recognition capability is proposed and demonstrated. Through the light-induced adjustment of dangling bond defects inside the amorphous silicon (a-Si) film, the device exhibits switchable volatile and nonvolatile photoconductivity (PC) behaviors at the wavelengths of 635 and 450nm, respectively. Based on the dual PC, the photonic synapse enables dual synaptic plasticity depending on the stimulation light, allowing not only various synaptic functions, but also learning experiences, associative learning behaviors, and recognition of the red and blue colors. Moreover, the dual synaptic plasticity of the photonic synapse could be modulated via a voltage in the range below approximate to 1V to realize the stable detection and precise extraction of the grayscale and color signals. With its simple structure and compatibility with existing Si-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, this photonic synapse shows potential for application in neuromorphic computing and advanced robot vision systems.

AB Lead (Pb) is one of the most common heavy metals and is harmful to human health. The liver is considered as a major target organ for Pb poisoning. Although probiotics have been shown to alleviate liver injury, the protective effect of Lactobacillus plantarum LP33 (LP33) against Pb-induced hepatotoxicity remains unclear. In order to explore the hepatoprotective effect of LP33, LP33 was administered to Pb-intoxicated Sprague-Dawley rats once daily by oral gavage for 8 weeks. The present results showed that LP33 supplementation alleviated liver injury, and inhibited oxidative stress and inflammation in Pb-exposed rats. Treatment with LP33 also promoted the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B, activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling and inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-KB signaling in liver tissues of rats exposed to Pb. Additionally, LP33 exhibited adequate Pb-binding capacity and satisfactory survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions in vitro, and promoted Pb excretion via enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. This study demonstrated that LP33 reduced Pb-induced oxidative stress and inflammation and promoted Pb excretion, thereby attenuating the Pb-induced hepatic injury. Our findings suggest that LP33 supplementation may be a potential strategy for the treatment of Pb-induced hepatic toxicity.

AB Due to the strong interaction with pollutants and the huge adsorption capacity, graphene adsorbents are widely applied in water decontamination. However, graphene adsorbents are seldom used in soil remediation, because the adsorptive sites on graphene would be occupied by soil components. In this study, we prepared carboxylated graphene oxide-chitosan (GO-COOH/CS) spheres for the immobilization of Cu2+ from water and soil. The pores in GO-COOH/CS allowed the internal diffusion of Cu2+ solution, while they blocked the direct contact between the solid soil and the adsorptive sites on graphene sheets. Therefore, the high adsorption capacity of GO-COOH/CS spheres (78 mg/g) was largely retained for the soil Cu2+ fixation. The partition coefficient (PC) for Cu2+ adsorption onto GO-COOH/CS spheres was 4.2 mg/g/mu M at C-e of 0.48 mg/L and q(e) of 31 mg/g, while the PC value decreased to 0.096 mg/g/mu M at C-e of 91.4 mg/L and q(e) of 78 mg/g. M initial Cu2+ concentrations of 120 mg/L and lower, the fixation efficiencies were all higher than 99% and the corresponding free Cu2+ concentrations in leachates were lower than 1.0 mg/L. The Cu2+ fixation on GO-COOH/CS spheres largely reduced its bioaccumulation in wheat roots from 127.8 mu g/g to 51.2 mu g/g. The toxicity evaluations suggested that GO-COOH/CS spheres were of low toxicity to wheat seedlings and did not amplify the toxicity of Cu2+. The implications to the design of graphene adsorbents for soil remediation are discussed. Overall, our results collectively indicated that porous GO-COOH/CS spheres were high-performance adsorbents for the immobilization of Cu2+ to reduce Cu2+ bioaccumulation in plants.

AB Proteolysis in fermented milk, a complex and dynamic process, depends on the starter cultures used. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of Lactobacillus plantarum or Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, or both, co-fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus, on the changes in the proteolysis profile of fermented milk during 21-day storage at 4 degrees C, including the pH value, proteolytic degree, protease activity, aminopeptidase activity, free amino acid content, and electrophoresis performance. The results showed that the treatments with co-cultures exhibited a higher amount of free amino groups and neutral protease activity at an extracellular level, whereas lower pH values and aminopeptidase activities towards the six substrates at an intracellular level than the ones with a single-strain of S. thermophilus over the refrigerated storage were observed. In co-fermentation with S. thermophilus, B. animalis subsp. lactis did not significantly affect the concentrations of most free amino acids, while contributions of L. plantarum were found. Electrophoresis indicated that the mixed starters, especially the co-cultures containing L. plantarum, showed a stronger degradation for caseins than the pure S. thermophilus culture. These findings suggest that culture combinations may influence the proteolysis characteristics of the fermented products, and probiotic cultures must be carefully chosen for fermented production.

AB The problem of how cooperative behaviors emerge in real world has been widely investigated and it is found that cooperative behaviors are closely related to memory, which means a rational player can get a more reasonable strategy by comprehensively considering certain amount of historical information within its memory scope. On the other hand, due to the potential risk during pursuing high payoff in human society, selecting the most common strategy for a player inside the interaction range is relatively safer, at least its payoff is not much lower than average, which is known as conformity. Motivated by these facts, we here propose a mechanism of conformity with memory whose core lies in two facts: (i) Each player first applies a memory rule to compare its own historical payoffs with a limited memory length and to take the strategy corresponding to the maximal payoff as historical optimal strategy; (ii) Each player can get the virtual optimal strategy by selecting the most common strategy from its neighbors' historical optimal strategies according to the conformity rule. The asynchronous updating algorithm, together with the virtual strategy, is used to study the evolution of cooperation with different memory lengths on a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism remarkably promotes cooperation in three classical evolutionary social dilemmas. More specifically, it is revealed that the cooperation level decreases gradually as the memory length increases in the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game, and that the cooperation level increases as so does the memory length in the stag-hunt game.

AB Soil fauna including macrofauna and mesofauna play important roles in the material cycle and energy flow of ecosystems. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the soil macrofauna and mesofauna have been studied in different ecosystems. However, the differences in spatiotemporal variability between soil macrofauna and mesofauna communities in the same ecosystem are still unknown. Soil macrofauna and mesofauna were investigated in April, August and November of 2008 in five forests and a subalpine meadow at elevations from 2659 to 3845 m. Results showed that the community composition of the soil macrofauna was more sensitive to habitat variation than that of soil mesofauna across the seasonal changes, but the community composition of soil mesofauna was more sensitive to seasonal changes than that of soil macrofauna across all the six habitats. Abundance, richness and Shannon index varied significantly between the six habitats for soil macrofauna but had no obvious spatial pattern for soil mesofauna. Moreover, the differences in abundances and diversity index between sampling months were not significant for soil macrofauna, but were significant for soil mesofauna. The spatial distributions of soil macrofauna were more easily affected by the changes in plant community and soil properties than those of the soil mesofauna, while the temporal dynamics of the soil mesofauna were more sensitive to the changes in climatic factors across sampling months than those of the soil macrofauna. These findings indicate that the soil macrofauna and mesofauna communities respond differently to spatiotemporal changes in environmental factors. The effects of plant communities are greater on soil macrofauna than on mesofauna and the effects of season are greater on soil mesofauna. These results also imply that differences from habitats and seasons should be respectively focused on soil macrofauna and mesofauna when monitoring soil fauna diversity in forest ecosystems.

AB Increases in nitrogen (N) deposition can greatly stimulate ecosystem net carbon (C) sequestration through positive N-induced effects on plant productivity. However, how net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components respond to different N addition rates remains unclear. Using an N addition gradient experiment (six levels: 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 gNm 2 yr(-1) in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we explored the responses of different ecosystem C fluxes to an N addition gradient and revealed mechanisms underlying the dynamic responses. Results showed that NEE, ecosystem respiration (ER), and gross ecosystem production (GEP) all increased linearly with N addition rates in the first year of treatment but shifted to N saturation responses in the second year with the highest NEE (7.77 +/- 0.48 mu molm(-2) s(-1) occurring under an N addition rate of 8 gNm(-2) yr(-1). The saturation responses of NEE and GEP were caused by N-induced accumulation of standing litter, which limited light availability for plant growth under high N addition. The saturation response of ER was mainly due to an N-induced saturation response of aboveground plant respiration and decreasing soil microbial respiration along the N addition gradient, while decreases in soil microbial respiration under high N addition were caused by N-induced reductions in soil pH. We also found that various components of ER, including aboveground plant respiration, soil respiration, root respiration, and microbial respiration, responded differentially to the N addition gradient. These results reveal temporal dynamics of N impacts and the rapid

AB Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) was used to separate and identify the compounds in Scutellaria indica L Fragmentation patterns of these compounds were investigated by the UHPLC-QTOF-MS technique in both negative and positive ion modes. By using this strategy, both intact precursors and fragment ions information were obtained from a single injection. A total of 42 phenolic and other compounds were unequivocally or tentatively identified from S. indica for the first time. Among them, 8 phenolic compounds: scutellarin, luteolin, naringenin, wogonoside, apigenin, hispidulin, wogonin and chrysin were further quantified and used as marker substances by multiple-reaction monitoring in negative ionization mode. The results demonstrated that the calibration curves for all analytes showed good linearity (R-2>0.9992) within the test ranges. The overall limits of detection and limits of quantification were 0.12-10.52 ng/mL and 4.67-20.22 ng/mL, respectively. The recovery was 96.02-102.88% with a relative standard deviation of less than 3.02%. It is proposed that the methods described here can be applied for rapid evaluation, quality control and authenticity establishment of S. indica. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that these composites possess a high specific capacitance (C-m) performance, good rate capability and long cycle stability. To be specific, the Cm of Ni/Co/S-1 composite is the largest, up to 954.3 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and as high as 309.5 F g(-1) even at large current density of 20 A g(-1). Furthermore, the Ni/Co/S-1 maintains 99.9% of its initial Cm after 1000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitors with Ni/Co/S-1 as positive electrode and active carbon as negative electrode are of prominent energy density of 29.3 W h(-1) kg(-1) at the power density of 0.7 kW kg(-1), and superior cycling stability of 99.1% initial value retention after 1000 cycles.

AB While tuning the electronic structure of Pt can thermodynamically alleviate CO poisoning in direct methanol fuel cells, the impact of interactions between intermediates on the reaction pathway is seldom studied. Herein, we contrive a PtBi model catalyst and realize a complete inhibition of the CO pathway and concurrent enhancement of the formate pathway in the alkaline methanol electrooxidation. The key role of Bi is enriching OH adsorbates (OHad) on the catalyst surface. The competitive adsorption of CO adsorbates (COad) and OHad at Pt sites, complementing the thermodynamic contribution from alloying Bi with Pt, switches the intermediate from COad to formate that circumvents CO poisoning. Hence, 8% Bi brings an approximately 6-fold increase in activity compared to pure Pt nanoparticles. This notion can be generalized to modify commercially available Pt/C catalysts by a microwave assisted method, offering opportunities for the design and practical production of CO-tolerance electrocatalysts in an industrial setting.

AB Nickel (Ni) is an environmental toxicant that can cause toxic damage to humans and animals. Although the hepatotoxicity of Ni has been confirmed, its precise mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the results showed that nickel chloride (NiCl2)-treatment could induce mice hepatotoxicity including hepatic histopathological alterations and up-regulation of serum AST and ALT. According to the results, NiCl2 increased malondialdehyde (MDA) production while reducing total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity and glutathione (GSH) content. Additionally, NiCl2 induced mitochondrial damage which was featured by increase in mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-IV and ATP content were decreased in the liver of NiCl2 -treated mice. Meanwhile, NiCl2 caused hepatic ferroptosis accompanied by increased iron content in the liver and up-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) protein and mRNA expression levels, down-regulation of glutathione eroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) protein and mRNA expression levels. Altogether, the above mentioned results indicate that NiCl2 treatment may induce hepatic damage through mitochondrial damage and ferroptosis.

AB Skin radiation damage is one of the most common illnesses in external beam radiotherapy. One of the vital reasons for the damage occurrence is the low-energy X-rays contained in treatment radiations, which are greatly absorbed by skin to cause severe skin injury. Thus, the physical prevention that shields the harmful low-energy Xrays may be an effective skin radioprotective approach. However, at present, the existing commercial skin radioprotective drugs mainly adopt a single chemical repair pathway to eliminate the intracellular toxic free radicals and usually have limited treatment outcomes. Therefore, in order to improve the therapeutic effects of radiodermatitis during radiotherapy, we attempt to design a new drug that possesses dual-mode physical prevention and chemical repair approach to enhance skin radioprotection efficacy. Herein, we for the first time design and synthesize nanosized graphdiyne-loaded sodium hyaluronate hydrogel (nano-GDY@SH hydrogel), which possesses powerful broad-spectrum free radical scavenging activity by the nano-GDY and good low-energy X-ray attenuation ability by the hydrogel with high water content. The experimental results indicated that nanoGDY@SH hydrogel exhibits good biosafety, and can effectively decrease the low-energy X-ray-induced edema and ulcers of skin in mice, mitigate pathological lesion, reduce skin damage time and promote wound recovery.

AB Background
   Cattleyak are the hybrid offspring between cattle and yak and combine yak hardiness with cattle productivity. Much attempt has been made to examine the mechanisms of male sterility caused by spermatogenic arrest, but yet there is no research systematically and precisely elucidated testis gene expression profiling between cattleyak and yak.
   Methods
   To explore the higher resolution comparative transcriptome map between the testes of yak and cattleyak, and further analyze the mRNA expression dynamics of spermatogenic arrest in cattleyak. We characterized the comparative transcriptome profile from the testes of yak and cattleyak using high-throughput sequencing. Then we used quantitative analysis to validate several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in testicular tissue and spermatogenic cells.
   Results
   Testis transcriptome profiling identified 6477 DEGs (2919 upregulated and 3558 downregulated) between cattleyak and yak. Further analysis revealed that the marker genes and apoptosis regulatory genes for undifferentiated spermatogonia were upregulated, while the genes for differentiation maintenance were downregulated in cattleyak. A majority of DEGs associated with mitotic checkpoint, and cell cycle progression were downregulated in cattleyak during spermatogonial mitosis. Furthermore, almost all DEGs related to synaptonemal complex assembly, and meiotic progression presented no sign of expression in cattleyak. Even worse, dozens of genes involved in acrosome formation, and flagellar development were dominantly downregulated in cattleyak.
   Conclusion
   DEGs indicated that spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak may originate from the differentiation stage of spermatogonial stem cells and be aggravated during spermatogonial mitosis and spermatocyte meiosis, which contributes to the scarcely presented sperms in cattleyak.

AB This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactic (Ba) in co-cultures with Streptococcus thermophilus (St) on changes in the acidification profile, proteolytic activity, peptide production, in vitro antioxidant activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties of fermented milks during 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. The pH values and proteolysis in all batches showed a gradual decrease and increase during storage, respectively. The ACE-inhibitory activity and total antioxidant capacity of all co-fermented milk samples followed a similar pattern, with maximum values on d 6 of storage. The St starter, in conjunction with Ba or Lp or both, enhanced proteolysis, peptide generation, and ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, but decreased pH values compared with St alone. The St-Ba-Lp samples showed higher DPPH* (1,1-diphenyl2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and total antioxidant capacity, but similar superoxide anion scavenging activity compared to St-Ba or St-Lp samples. The St-Ba samples showed higher DPPH* radical scavenging activity but lower hydroxyl radical scavenging activity than St-Lp samples. In the ACE-inhibitory assays, the St-Lp samples exhibited relatively low activity among the co-fermented milks, digested or not. The presence of Ba and Lp in fermentation together did not affect ACE-inhibitory activity in undigested fermented milks compared with the presence of Ba alone, and St-Ba-Lp fermented milks demonstrated an increase in ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in storage. Pepsin digestion largely improved ACE-inhibitory activity, except in St-Lp samples, in which the activity was reduced. Further hydrolysis by trypsin reduced final activity in digestion. This study suggests that co-cultured fermentation with probiotics improves in vitro antioxidant and ACE inhibition activity in fermented milks, and this effect is partly due to the higher proteolytic activity of probiotics.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated power control method with virtual inertia (VI) for fuel cell-based DC microgrids (MGs) cluster based on the multi-agent system (MAS) control frame. In the primary control layer, a local energy management strategy with virtual inertia is adopted to suppress the bus voltage disturbance, smooth the output power of fuel cell, as well as manage the power flow in the DC MG. In the secondary and tertiary control layers, a coordinated power control method based on MAS frame is implemented for the power flow among the sub-MGs. More specifically, the secondary voltage control loop is used for the bus voltage smooth control at the moment of microgrids interconnection, and the power flow tertiary control regular is applied for the battery SoC converge uniformly in finite time. Also, a fuel cell-based DC microgrids cluster real-time simulation platform is established to verify the control performance of the proposed coordinated power control method on the bus voltage smooth control, the SoC consistency control, load abrupt response and 'plug and play' capability.

AB Graphene materials are high-performance adsorbents for water and soil remediation, whose oxygen containing groups bind to metal ions intensely. In this study, we prepared carboxylated graphene oxide (GO-OCH2COOH) sponge and investigated the adsorption behaviors of Cu2+ on it by both experimental and computational approaches. Carboxylation largely improved the adsorption capacity from 23.8 mg/g for graphene oxide (GO) sponge to 93.8 mg/g for GO-OCH2COOH. The efficient adsorption was due to the strong interaction between Cu2+ and carboxyl groups (especially in -OCH2COOH form) according to the density functional theory calculation, while epoxy and hydroxyl groups contributed lowly. The fast adsorption process was achieved within 30 min, corresponding to a large k(2) value of pseudo-second order model (0.061 mg/g/min). The adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic according to thermodynamics analyses. The binding strength of Cu2+ on GO-OCH2COOH was so strong that pH and ionic strength had mild impact. The strong binding sites were not recyclable, but the weaker ones (more than 40%) could be regenerated by simple washing. Our results highlighted the importance of chemical design in graphene adsorbents and the potential of GO-OCH2COOH in heavy metal fixation from water and soil. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The yak is a valuable species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying its adaptation to high-altitude environments remain largely unknown. In the present study, comparative transcriptome sequencing was performed for lung and gluteus tissues from two species of low-altitude cattle (Sanjiang and Holstein cattle), Tibetan cattle (living at a moderate altitude), and yak (living at a high altitude) and the differentially expressed genes were validated using real-time quantitative PCR. The results showed that CD36 antigen was up-regulated and CD59 antigen was down-regulated in yak in comparison to the other animals, which might promote the development of red blood cells and inhibit the development of lymphocytes in yak. In addition, thrombospondin type 1, coagulation factor 5/8, and fibronectin were all down-regulated, but serpin and alpha 2-macrog lobulin (A2M) were up-regulated. These differences would inhibit blood coagulation, thus reducing the risk of pulmonary edema. The expression levels of the calcium-release, potassium, and transient receptor potential channels decreased in yak, minimizing membrane depolarization and the harmful effects of pulmonary edema. Eleven KEGG pathways associated with innate immunity were more activated in yak and Tibetan cattle than in other cattle strains, which should reduce their risk of infection and disease. These changes together might facilitate the adaptation of yak and Tibetan cattle to live in high-altitude habitats.

AB Jinchuan yak, a newly discovered yak breed, not only possesses a large proportion of multi-ribs but also exhibits many good characteristics, such as high meat production, milk yield, and reproductive performance. However, there is limited information about its overall genetic structure, relationship with yaks in other areas, and possible origins and evolutionary processes. In this study, 7,693,689 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by resequencing the genome of Jinchuan yak. Principal component and population genetic structure analyses showed that Jinchuan yak could be distinguished as an independent population among the domestic yak population. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that the decay rate of Jinchuan yak was the lowest of the domestic yak breeds, indicating that the degree of domestication and selection intensity of Jinchuan yak were higher than those of other yak breeds. Combined with archaeological data, we speculated that the origin of domestication of Jinchuan yak was approximate to 6000 yr ago (4000-10,000 yr ago). The quantitative dynamics of population growth history in Jinchuan yak was similar to that of other breeds of domestic and wild yaks, but was closer to that of the wild yak. No significant gene exchange between Jinchuan and other domestic yaks occurred. Compared with other domestic yaks, Jinchuan yak possessed 339 significantly and positively selected genes, several of which relate to physiological rhythm, histones, and the breed's excellent production characteristics. Our results provide a basis for the discovery of the evolution, molecular origin, and unique traits of Jinchuan yak.

AB Ultrasmall Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals with high near infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion abilities and peroxidase-mimic properties are synthesized and functionalized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for rapid clearance multifunctional theranostic platform. Due to the presence of Cu (I) of CZTS@BSA, H2O2 could be decomposed to produce highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), catalyzed by intrinsic peroxidase like activity of CZTS. The CZTS@BSA possesses high NIR absorption and excellent photoacoustic (PA) imaging abilities. The as-prepared CZTS@BSA is also reported as an efficient T1 contrast agent for in vivo MR imaging. Therefore, in vivo distribution and rapid renal clearance of CZTS@BSA are successfully tracked by PA/MR dual-modal-imaging and further proved by ICP-MS analysis. Systemic acute toxicity evaluation indicates CZTS@BSA have good biocompatibility to normal tissues and blood. All results reveal that CZTS@BSA could act as a rapid clearance theranostic nanoplatform for dual-modal-imaging guided tumor PTT. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spongy graphene is a newly developed adsorbent of high performance for water treatment. Proper functionalization is an efficient approach to improve the adsorption capacity of graphene adsorbents. In this study, we prepared graphene oxide (GO), functionalized it with carboxyl groups to produce carboxylated GO (GO-COOH) dispersion, and lyophilized the GO-COOH dispersion to obtain the GO-COOH sponge. The adsorption isotherm, kinetics, thermodynamics, influencing factors, and regeneration of the adsorption of dye methylene blue (MB) on GO-COOH sponge were evaluated in batch experiments. The adsorption capacity of GO-COOH sponge was measured as 780 mg/g, which was nearly twice that of GO sponge (446 mg/g). The adsorption isotherm could be well described by the Freundlich model with a K-F of 508 (L/mg)(1/n). The adsorption kinetic was nicely fitted by pseudo-first-order model with a k(1) of 0.00157.min(-1). In thermodynamics analysis, the negative Delta G indicated the spontaneous nature of adsorption on GO-COOH sponge. The adsorption process was endothermic and was driven by the increase of entropy. Higher pH benefited the removal of MB by GO-COOH sponge and the ionic strength had no meaningful effect. The regeneration was poor due to the strong electrostatic interaction between MB and the GO-COOH sponge. The results collectively suggested that carboxylation increased the adsorption performance of GO sponge.

ID DEFRAGMENTATION; ALLOCATION
AB Elastic optical networks employ flexible routing and spectrum allocation algorithms to support diverse services and heterogeneous traffic. By splitting a traffic request into multiple small-size subconnections and individually transmitting them through several optical paths, multipath routing algorithms can more flexibly utilize spectrum resources than single-path routing algorithms in dynamic scenario. However, due to the imperfect shape of optical filters deployed in the network, guard bands are typically inserted between two adjacent connections in spectrum domain and, thus, cannot be used to transmit data. When the traffic load is heavy, multipath algorithms severely suffer this spectrum waste from deploying many subconnections and result in lower spectrum efficiency than single-path routing. Moreover, multipath routing algorithms require more bandwidth-variable transponders (BVT), which may lead to a higher cost. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multipath routing algorithm with traffic grooming (MPTG) to tackle this problem of multipath routing under heavy traffic load. By aggregating small-size connections originated from the same source node and sharing common fiber links, traffic grooming enhances the network throughput, and also effectively reduce the BVT consumption. The simulation results show that our proposed MPTG algorithm dramatically reduced bandwidth blocking ratio and BVT usage compared with previous multipath routing algorithm.

AB Wound healing is a dynamic and complex biological process, and traditional biological excipients cannot meet the needs of the wound healing process, and there is an urgent need for a biological dressing with multifunctionality and the ability to participate in all stages of wound healing. This study developed tea polyphenol (TP) incorporated multifunctional hydrogel based on oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide (OBSP) and adipic acid dihydrazide modified gelatin (Gel-ADH) with antimicrobial, antioxidant hemostatic, and anti-inflammatory properties to promote wound healing. The composite OBSP, Gel-ADH, TP (OBGTP) hydrogels prepared by double crosslinking between OBSP, TP and Gel-ADH via Schiff base bonding and hydrogen bonding had good rheological and swelling properties. The introduction of TP provided the composite hydrogel with excellent antioxidant antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coil). In the rat liver hemorrhage model and skin injury model, the OBGTP composite hydrogel had significant (p < 0.001) hemostatic ability, and had the ability to accelerate collagen deposition, reduce the expression of inflammatory factors, and promote rapid wound healing. In addition, OBGTP hydrogels had adhesive properties and good biocompatibility. In conclusion, OBGTP multifunctional composite hydrogels have great potential for wound healing applications.

AB In this study, vanadium powder (V) was employed as a cocatalyst to enhance the Fenton-like system. The V-Fe(III)/ H2O2 system can rapidly produce hydroxyl radicals and completely oxidize chloramphenicol with exceptionally high stability for long-term operation. The low-valent vanadium sites on the surface during the stepwise oxidation of vanadium from V0 to V(IV) can donate electrons for direct H2O2 activation and indirect Fenton reaction by reducing Fe(III) to produce hydroxyl radicals. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculation unveils that low-valent vanadium sites of vanadium can lengthen Fe-O bonds of FeOH2+ to elevate the oxidation potential of Fe(III) and promote Fe(III) reduction induced by H2O2. The self-cleaning effect of vanadium under acidic conditions can maintain reactive sites for sustainable electron donation and long-lasting enhanced Fenton oxidation. This study provides a novel enhanced Fenton oxidation for water remediation and the first mechanistic insights into the origins of V-based advanced oxidation technologies, it may also be beneficial to treat vanadium-contained wastewater.

AB Heterogeneous photocatalytic processes have exhibited tremendous potential in the field of solar energy and environmental remediation. Next to TiO2, ZnO has been widely used as a promising photocatalyst material in recent years. However, several noticeable drawbacks make it less effective, such as poor solar-light harvesting and rapid recombination of photo-excited charge carriers. To overcome these drawbacks, the decoration of noble metal nanoparticles on ZnO surfaces is a feasible strategy due to its localized surface plasmon resonance absorption, which aggrandizes the visible absorption of ZnO. In addition, the formation of the Schottky barrier at the metal-semiconductor interface can effectively separate photo-induced charge carriers. Among theses noble metals, due to the high conductivity, antimicrobial activity, mechanical thermal strength, and electrical double layer capacitance of silver (Ag), Ag-decorated ZnO (ZnO/Ag) nano-photocatalysts have exhibited remarkable photocatalytic efficiency and high cost performance for the degradation of organic pollutants, endowing them with growing potential in applications. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements (including the fundamental degradation mechanisms, synthesis methods, corresponding applications, and optimized strategies ) in ZnO/Ag-based photocatalysts for visible light-driven photocatalytic degradation, and conclude with a perspective on the future direction and prospects for these types of nanocomposite photocatalysts.

AB Multi-functional polymer gel materials based on thermal phase change materials (PCMs) are rapidly advancing the application of thermal energy storage (TES) in energy-saving buildings. In this work, we report multi-functional PCM composites with anti-liquid leakage, shape memory, switchable optical transparency, and thermal energy storage. Due to the excellent encapsulation performance of the in situ polymerized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) porous matrix, polyethylene glycol (PEG2000) PCM is unlikely to leak liquid even if the composites are stretched or sheared at 65 degrees C. The PCM composites reversibly transform from white rigid materials at 35 degrees C to super-elastic materials with a light transmittance of 88.5% at 65 degrees C (fracture strain of 450% and fracture stress of 2600 kPa). The PCM composites for thermal energy storage combine large latent heat (79.9 J g(-1)) with reliable one-way shape memory function. As-prepared composite provides a novel research direction for the design of thermal phase change materials, which is expected to be widely used in the fields of energy-saving buildings, medical equipment, high temperature warning, thermal energy storage, and temperature control in the future.

AB This study proposes new approaches for the dissipative analysis issue of high-speed train systems. First, an improved boundary circulatory functional approach is introduced for constructing a weak Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which can fully excavate some intrinsic relationships between sampling interval and time delay. Based on the looped-functional tactics and recombinant technology, the constraint conditions are further relaxed for obtaining new theoretical results. Second, by using resultful integral inequalities and correlation analysis approaches, several relaxed criteria are established with respect to the asymptotical stable of the considered sampled-data systems. Third, a new reliable memory sampling controller is designed under the desired dissipative performance. Finally, numerical experiments on high-speed trains on the Shinkansen in Japan illustrate the importance of theoretical results.

   Due to the rapid economic growth, high-speed trains provide more convenience and faster speed for people's lives. Highspeed trains have been widely used by the public due to important areas such as transportation capacity, energy resolution, environmental protection, and punctuality [1-3] . However, high-speed trains still face some challenges such as safety, reliability, comfort and energy consumption [4,5] . Therefore, working to solve these challenges is the fundamental purpose of the current research on high-speed trains. In order to maintain the low energy consumption, reliability, comfort and riding experience of high-speed trains, multi

AB Nanoporous tantalum pentoxide (NTP) particles with a pore size of about 10 nm were synthesized and blended with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) to fabricate a PEEK/NTP composite (PN). Subsequently, PN was treated by concentrated sulfuric acid to create a microporous surface (pore size of around 2 mu m) on sulfonated PN (SPN), which formed a hierarchical micro & nanoporous surface. Compared with PN, the porous surface of SPN exhibited higher roughness, hydrophilicity, and surface energy. In addition, genistein (GT) was loaded into the porous surface of SPN (SPNG), which showed high GT loading capacity and sustained release of GT into phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Moreover, SPNG revealed excellent antibacterial activity, which inhibited bacterial (E. coli and S. aureus) growth in vitro due to the synergistic effects of both sulfonic acid (SO3H) groups and the sustained release of GT. Compared with PN, SPN significantly improved the adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. Moreover, compared with SPN, SPNG further enhances the cell responses. Compared with PN, SPN remarkably improved bone formation and osteointegration in vivo. Furthermore, compared with SPN, SPNG further enhanced the osteointegration. In short, SPNG with a micro & nanoporous surface, SO3H groups, and the sustained release of GT exhibited antibacterial activity and accelerated osteointegration, which would have tremendous potential as drug-loaded implants for bone substitute.

DE Bankruptcy prediction; Ensemble learning; Learning with label

ID FINANCIAL RATIOS; CREDIT RISK; DECISION TREE; PERFORMANCE; MODELS
AB Corporate bankruptcy prediction is an interesting and important research topic that can be conceived in many practical applications. Recently, machine learning based methods have been widely proposed to solve the problem of bankruptcy prediction. However, the existing models do not consider that large amounts of instance-level labeled training data are hard to be obtained in practice. In this paper, we propose to address bankruptcy prediction problem from the perspective of learning with label proportions, where the unlabeled training data are provided in different bags and only giving the bag-level proportion of instances belonging to a particular class. Then, we contribute two novel prediction methods, termed as Bagged-pSVM and Boosted-pSVM, based on proportion support vector machines and ensemble strategies including bagging and boosting. The proposed methods can not only explicitly model the unknown instance-level labels and the known label proportions under a large-margin framework, but also improve the performance through introducing ensemble learning strategies. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate their efficiency and superiority on solving the problem of bankruptcy prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Single-phase Ti3SiC2 was successfully prepared by using a new ratio of raw materials and coarse starting powder (similar to 70 mu m). To reveal the mechanism of aluminum acting as a sintering aid in the reaction synthesis of singlephase Ti3SiC2, mixtures of 3T1/1.5Si/1.9C/xAl (x = 0-0.6) were sintered to synthesize Ti3SiC2 through pressureless sintering. The results showed that the molten Al reacted with oxygen to act as a deoxidizer and promoted the nucleation of Ti3SiC2 during the sintering process. An optimal amount of Al can accelerate the reaction between the TiC and Ti5Si3 intermediate phases, while excessive Al will hinder diffusion and reduce the purity of Ti3SiC2 by forming Al2O3 on the grain boundaries. The optimum experimental parameters for the synthesis of single-phase Ti3SiC2 were determined as a Ti/Si/C/Al molar ratio of 3/1.5/1.9/0.5, holding at 1400 degrees C for 2 h.

AB As a hot research topic in the field of psychology and psychiatry, trait optimism reflects the tendency to expect positive outcomes in the future. Consistent evidence has demonstrated the role of trait optimism in reducing anxiety among different populations. However, less is known about the neural bases of trait optimism and the underlying mechanisms for how trait optimism protects against anxiety in the healthy brain. In this investigation, we examined these issues in 231 healthy adolescent students by assessing resting-state brain activity (i.e., fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and connectivity (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC). Whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of trait optimism were linked with decreased fALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and increased RSFC between the right OFC and left supplementary motor cortex (SMC). Mediation analyses further showed that trait optimism mediated the influence of the right OFC activity and the OFC-SMC connectivity on anxiety. Our results remained significant even after excluding the impact of head motion, positive and negative affect and depression. Taken together, this study reveals that fALFF and RSFC are functional neural markers of trait optimism and provides a brain-personality-symptom pathway for protection against anxiety in which fALFF and RSFC affect anxiety through trait optimism.

We employ ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation methods, and find that corruption significantly increases mortality rates, and reduces life expectancy and immunization rates. The results are consistent across different regions, gender, and measures of corruption. The findings suggest that reducing corruption can be an effective method to improve health outcomes.

AB Alpine grasslands are currently experiencing an increasing threat from overgrazing, and grazing exclusion has been widely used as a simple and effective method for restoring degraded grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This paper studied effects of grazing exclusion on ecosystem respiration (Re), plant and soil characteristics for two growing season (2012 and 2013) in three alpine grasslands (alpine steppe, alpine meadow and swamp meadow) on the central TP. Grazing exclusion enhanced plant height, total cover, aboveground biomass and belowground biomass in all the three alpine grasslands. Grazing exclusion increased Re in alpine steppe and alpine meadow, but decreased Re in swamp meadow. Soil temperature and soil moisture well explained the seasonal variations of Re in alpine steppe and alpine meadow. However, soil temperature, rather than soil moisture, was the major environment factor controlling the seasonal variation of Re in swamp meadows. The temperature sensitivity of Re (Q(10)) was higher in swamp meadow and alpine meadow compared with alpine steppe. Grazing exclusion had a slight tendency to decrease Q(10) in alpine steppe and alpine meadow, but increase Q(10) in swamp meadows. Results suggest that grazing exclusion effects on Re and Q(10) of alpine grassland were determined by vegetation types. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on daily precipitation records at five meteorological stations during 1978-2013 periods, the spatial and temporal characteristics of twelve indices of extreme precipitation in Southeastern Tibet have been investigated. Most precipitation indices do not exhibit consistent or statistically significant trends across the region. Regionally averaged total precipitation, consecutive dry days (CDD), heavy precipitation days (R10) and simple daily intensity index (SDII) have increased, but only consecutive dry days (CDD) are statistically significant. At the same time, there has been an insignificant decrease in regionally averaged very heavy precipitation days (R20), extremely heavy precipitation days (R25), consecutive wet days (CWD), very wet days (R95p) and extremely wet days (R99p), maximum 1-day precipitation amount (Rx1day), maximum 5-days precipitation amount (Rx5days) and Wet days (NW). The distribution of positive and negative slopes in the area is extremely irregular. The spatial and temporal distributions of indices of climate extremes in monthly precipitation extremes show differences. In addition, there were significant correlations between annual total precipitation and precipitation extremes, except consecutive dry days. Change of most extreme precipitation indices is affected by the South Asia summer monsoon (SASM) evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB The identification of suitable reference genes is critical for obtaining reliable results from gene expression studies using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) because the expression of reference genes may vary considerably under different experimental conditions. In most cases, however, commonly used reference genes are employed in data normalization without proper validation, which may lead to incorrect data interpretation. Here, we aim to select a set of optimal reference genes for the accurate normalization of gene expression associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition during development. In the present study, eight reference genes (PPIB, HMBS, RPLP0, B2M, YWHAZ, 18S, GAPDH and ACTB) were evaluated by three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) in two types of muscle tissues (longissimus dorsi muscle and biceps femoris muscle) across different developmental stages. All three algorithms gave similar results. PPIB and HMBS were identified as the most stable reference genes, while the commonly used reference genes 18S and GAPDH were the most variably expressed, with expression varying dramatically across different developmental stages. Furthermore, to reveal the crucial role of appropriate reference genes in obtaining a reliable result, analysis of PPARG expression was performed by normalization to the most and the least stable reference genes. The relative expression levels of PPARG normalized to the most stable reference genes greatly differed from those normalized to the least stable one. Therefore, evaluation of reference genes must be performed for a given experimental condition before the reference genes are used. PPIB and HMBS are the optimal reference genes for analysis of gene expression associated with IMF deposition in skeletal muscle during development.

AB The ability of soil aggregates to adsorb heavy metals is controlled by their different component contents. However, the influence of specific components on the adsorption behavior is uncertain. In this study, organic matter and iron and manganese oxides in aggregates of different particle sizes from red paddy soil were selectively removed. The influence of these components on cadmium adsorption was also examined. Results showed that Langmuir equation could accurately describe the adsorption characteristics of Cd in bulk soil and aggregates. The <0.002 mm fraction had the largest adsorption capacity for Cd because of its higher content of organic matter and Fe and Mn oxides. Removal of organic matter, amorphous Fe oxides or Mn oxides could cause obvious decrease in Cd adsorption, whereas an opposite result was observed for free Fe oxides removal. Removing unit mass of Fe or Mn oxides showed stronger effect on the adsorption capacity compared with that of organic matter. Desorption characteristics of Cd in various aggregates appeared to be unaffected by organic matter but more determined by free and amorphous Fe oxides.

AB With the massive release of microplastics (MPs) into the environment, research related to MPs is advancing rapidly. Effective research methods are necessary to identify the chemical composition, shape, distribution, and environmental impacts of MPs. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven machine learning methods have demonstrated excellent performance in analyzing MPs in soil and water. This review provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning methods for the prediction of MPs for various tasks, and discusses in detail the data source, data preprocessing, algorithm principle, and algorithm limitation of applied machine learning. In addition, this review discusses the limitation of current machine learning methods for various task analysis in MPs along with future prospect. Finally, this review finds research potential in future work in building large generalized MPs datasets, designing high-performance but low -computational -complexity algorithms , evaluating model interpretability.

AB Wounds in harsh environments can face long-term inflammation and persistent infection, which can slow healing. Wound spray is a product that can be rapidly applied to large and irregularly dynamic wounds, and can quickly form a protective film in situ to inhibit external environmental infection. In this study, a biodegradable A and B combined multi-functional spray hydrogel is developed with methacrylate-modified chitosan (CSMA1st) and ferulic acid (FA) as type A raw materials and oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide (OBSP) as type B raw materials. The precursor CSMA1st-FA/OBSP (CSOB-FA1st) hydrogel is formed by the self-cross-linking of dynamic Schiff base bonds, the CSMA-FA/OBSP (CSOB-FA) hydrogel is formed quickly after UV-vis light, so that the hydrogel fits with the wound. Rapid spraying and curing provide sufficient flexibility and rapidity for wounds and the hydrogel has good injectability, adhesive, and mechanical strength. In rats and miniature pigs, the A and B combined spray hydrogel can shrink wounds and promote healing of infected wounds, and promote the enrichment of fibrocyte populations. Therefore, the multifunctional spray hydrogel combined with A and B can protect irregular dynamic wounds, prevent wound infection and secondary injury, and be used for safe and effective wound treatment, which has a good prospect for development.
   Biodegradable A and B compound multi-functional spray hydrogel composed of CS, FA, and BSP natural materials. Spray hydrogels can be instantly sprayed and secured to the wound. Spray hydrogels can shrink wounds, be anti-inflammatory, and promote the healing of the irregular, dynamic infectious wounds. Spray hydrogel has a good healing effect on small and large animal wounds. image

AB Background: Lonicera rupicola Hook.f.et Thoms (LRH) is used as a customary medicinal herb in Tibetans. And LRH flavonoids have excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pharmacological activities. However, the specific effects of LRH and its mechanism remain unknown, and there is a deficiency of systematic research, leading to the waste of LRH as a medicinal resource.Purpose: In this study, in an attempt to rationalize the development and utilization of Tibetan herbal resources, the therapeutic efficacy and the underlying molecular mechanisms of LRH flavonoids on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) were investigated, establishing the favorable basis for the pharmacodynamic material basis of LRH and providing a scientific basis for the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of UC. Methods: Firstly, ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used for identification and detection of the flavonoid components of LRH. Meanwhile, their potential targets, biological functions and signaling pathways were predicted with the assistance of network pharmacology analysis. Subsequently, pharmacological efficacy of LRH were evaluated by body weight loss, colon length, disease activity index (DAI), histology observation and the expression levels of inflammatory mediators, messenger RNA (mRNA) and tight junction proteins. Moreover, in the present investigation, we also profiled the gut microbiome via high-throughput sequencing of the V3 -V4 region of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for bacterial community composition and diversity by Illumina MiSeq platforms. Finally, the key regulatory proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathways were measured to investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms.Results: A total of 37 LRH flavonoid components were identified and detected by UPLC-MS/MS, and 12 potential active components were obtained after screening. 137 of their common targets with UC were further predicted. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and molecular docking experiments demonstrated that LRH flavonoids could interfere with UC through "multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway". In the animal experiments, LRH flavonoids could significantly attenuate UC as demonstrated by reducing the body weight loss and DAI, restoring colon length, decreasing oxidative stress, and improving the intestinal epithelial cell barrier. The mRNA and proteins expression levels of inflammatory mediators were returned to dynamic balance following LRH flavonoids treatment. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that LRH flavonoids promoted the recovery of gut microbiome. And the PI3K/AKT pathway was significantly suppressed by LRH flavonoids.Conclusions: LRH flavonoids exhibited multifaceted protective effects against DSS-induced UC in mice through mitigating colon inflammation and oxidative stress, restoring epithelial barrier function, and improving the gut microenvironment potentially through modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This finding demonstrated that LRH flavonoids possessed great potential for becoming an excellent drug for the treatment of UC.

ID COST; LEED
AB The industry is facing severe environmental degradation challenges and complex regulatory systems. A sustainable and innovative business model of green building is regarded as an important strategy for the realization of ecological and economic value. However, from a system perspective, research on the interest boundaries of stakeholders and the decision-making process is still relatively limited. This study addresses the gap by developing a systematic game analysis framework that integrates government, developer and consumer as players. Results indicate that the convergence of the stable strategy system is closely related to the initial strategy selection of each stakeholder. The government's policy cost cannot promote the stability of the system. Compared with economic benefits, consumers' recognition of the ecological value of green buildings is an important factor. Stakeholders' attention to their benefits and costs dominates the market. The government's subsidy strategy depends on the profit and loss of the target, not that the higher the incentive, the more significant the effect can be obtained. This study enhances the body of knowledge by providing a novel framework for research in related disciplines. It also provides insights into the decision-making mechanism of stakeholders in the green building market.

AB Skin wounds are usually accompanied by bacterial infections and inflammations, leading to delayed wound healing, which remain a great challenge in clinical treatment. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop wound dressings that inhibit bacterial infections to accelerate wound healing. Herein, we reported the fabrication of inclusion complex (a beta-cyclodextrin covalent organic framework loaded with enrofloxacin and flunixin meglumine) - incorporated electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane fibers (named ENR-FM-COF-TPU) via electrospinning. The obtained ENR-FM-COF-TPU fibrous membrane exhibited excellent physicochemical and biological properties such as uniform and stable morphology, proper hydrophobicity, good water uptake capacity, and admirable biocompatibility, which showed perfect behavior as a wound dressing. In addition, the ENR-FM-COF-TPU membrane achieved a sustained drug release of enrofloxacin and flunixin meglumine and displayed powerful antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with 99% inhibitory efficiency for 50 h. More importantly, the wound healing therapy effect was investigated using a full-thickness skin defect model of mice. It suggested that the ENR-FM-COF-TPU membrane could significantly accelerate and enhance wound healing through downregulating inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) and increasing the expression of growth factors (VEGF and EGF). Due to its excellent properties, the ENR-FM-COF-TPU membrane may have promising potential in wound healing applications.

AB Brain network analysis is one efficient tool in exploring human brain diseases and can differentiate the alterations from comparative networks. The alterations account for time, mental states, tasks, individuals, and so forth. Furthermore, the changes determine the segregation and integration of functional networks that lead to network reorganization (or reconfiguration) to extend the neuroplasticity of the brain. Exploring related brain networks should be of interest that may provide roadmaps for brain research and clinical diagnosis. Recent electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have revealed the secrets of the brain networks and diseases (or disorders) within and between subjects and have provided instructive and promising suggestions and methods. This review summarized the corresponding algorithms that had been used to construct functional or effective networks on the scalp and cerebral cortex. We reviewed EEG network analysis that unveils more cognitive functions and neural disorders of the human and then explored the relationship between brain science and artificial intelligence which may fuel each other to accelerate their advances, and also discussed some innovations and future challenges in the end.

AB Hierarchical clustering is of great importance in data analysis. Although there are a number of hierarchical clustering algorithms including agglomerative methods, divisive methods and hybrid methods, most of them are sensitive to noise points, suffer from high computational cost and cannot effectively discover clusters with complex structures. When recognizing patterns from complex structures, humans intuitively tend to discover obvious clusters in dense regions firstly and then deal with objects on the border. Inspired by this idea, we propose a local cores-based hierarchical clustering algorithm called HCLORE. The proposed method first partitions the data set into several clusters by finding local cores, instead of optimizing an objective function through iteration like K-means; then temporarily removes points with lower local density, so that the boundary between clusters is clearer; after that merges clusters according to a newly defined similarities between clusters; and finally points with lower local density are assigned to the same clusters as their local cores belong to. The experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets show that our algorithm is more effective and efficient than existing methods when processing data sets with complex structures.

AB HKT1 and SOS1 are two key Na+ transporters that modulate salt tolerance in plants. Although much is known about the respective functions of HKT1 and SOS1 under salt conditions, few studies have examined the effects of HKT1 and SOS1 mutations on the expression of other important Na+ and K+ transporter genes. This study investigated the physiological parameters and expression profiles of AtHKT1;1, AtSOS1, AtHAK5, AtAKT1, AtSKOR, AtNHX1, and AtAVP1 in wild-type (WT) and athkt1;1 and atsos1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana under 25 mM NaCl. We found that AtSOS1 mutation induced a significant decrease in transcripts of AtHKT1;1 (by 56-62% at 6-24 h), AtSKOR (by 36-78% at 6-24 h), and AtAKT1 (by 31-53% at 6-24 h) in the roots compared with WT. This led to an increase in Na+ accumulation in the roots, a decrease in K+ uptake and transportation, and finally resulted in suppression of plant growth. AtHKT1;1 loss induced a 39-76% (6-24 h) decrease and a 27-32% (6-24 h) increase in transcripts of AtSKOR and AtHAK5, respectively, in the roots compared with WT. At the same time, 25 mM NaCl decreased the net selective transport capacity for K+ over Na+ by 92% in the athkt1;1 roots compared with the WT roots. Consequently, Na+ was loaded into the xylem and delivered to the shoots, whereas K+ transport was restricted. The results indicate that AtHKT1;1 and AtSOS1 not only mediate Na+ transport but also control ion uptake and the spatial distribution of Na+ and K+ by cooperatively regulating the expression levels of relevant Na+ and K+ transporter genes, ultimately regulating plant growth under salt stress.

AB Addressed in this paper is the robust H-infinity control issue of T-S fuzzy systems with input time-varying delays. By means of the delay partitioning method, the delay interval is partitioned into multiple unequal subintervals whose lengths satisfy a geometric sequence. On this basis, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is presented to analyze asymptotic stability of the open-loop system. Then a state feedback controller that ensures a prescribed H-infinity performance level for the closed-loop system is proposed in linear matrix inequality format.

AB In this work, for the first time, we uncover that the level of security we have traditionally taken for granted on underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) may not always be there. We first numerically investigate the security weaknesses of UWOC via Monte Carlo simulation. With the link distance increasing or the water becoming more turbid, the simulation results indicate that the possibility of information leakage increases, which may pose a great threat to the security of UWOC. By using a high-sensitivity multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) placed aside the water tank, a 5-MHz square wave signal is successfully tapped at 1-m, 3-m, and 5-m underwater transmission distances, which preliminarily verifies the probability of information leakage. We further experimentally demonstrate an UWOC system with potential eavesdropping employing a 2.5-Gb/ s orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. After transmitting through a 15m underwater channel, the OFDM signal is eavesdropped by a mirror at 7.8 m. Both the normal receiver at 15 m and the eavesdropping receiver at 7.8 m can achieve a bit error rate (BER) below the forward error correction (FEC) limit of 3.8 x 10(-3), which validates that UWOC indeed suffers potential safety hazard.

AB China's excessive reliance on natural resources has resulted in the dual challenges of sluggish economic growth and significant ecological damage. Addressing the resource curse and realizing sustainable economic development have emerged as paramount concerns in regional development. Exploring practical strategies to overcome these challenges and foster a more sustainable and resilient economic landscape is crucial. This study explores the impact of natural resource dependence (NRD) on green technology innovation (GTI) using Chinese provincial administrative regions data between 2011 and 2021. The finding demonstrates that natural resource dependence significantly impedes regional green technology innovation, especially in resource-based and central and western provinces. Furthermore, it investigates the effects of NRD on regional green innovation under different levels of government integrity and public environmental concern. The findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of NRD on regional green innovation is more pronounced with lower levels of government integrity. Conversely, public environmental concerns can partially alleviate the inhibitory effect of natural resource dependence on green technology innovation. Hence, promoting the development of new industries, actively constructing diversified economic structures, enhancing government integrity, and gradually improving the public participatory environmental regulatory system are essential measures to tackle the problem of resource dependency and promote the enhancement of regional green technology innovation.

AB A novel Fe/Co metal organic complex nanosheet modified by 1,4-dicarboxybenzene (BDC), i.e., FeCo@BDC, was prepared, and highly efficient removal performance for trace lead (II) (Pb2+) was demonstrated in the neutral aqueous solutions. The removal rates were higher than 95% and the adsorption was equilibrated in 15 min. The isotherms and kinetics for the adsorption Pb2+ by the FeCo@BDC adsorbents followed Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity was 220.48 mg g(-1). The FeCo@BDC adsorbents also own a prominent regeneration performance. The promi-nent performance of in the removal of trace Pb2+ makes FeCo@BDC an ideal candidate as commercial adsorbent materials.

AB Cu-doped ZnO nanoparticles composited with Ag were synthesized by a one-step sol-gel method in this work, aiming at highly photocatalytic activity and possible application under sunlight (especially near ultraviolet and visible light regions, 3000-760 nm) irradiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows that the introduction of Cu inhibits particle aggregation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal that Zn(Cu)O-Ag nanoparticles (CZA NPs) are composed of metallic Ag (Ag0) and Zn(Cu)O nanocrystals; while at the Cu concentration of higher than 2%, a few CuO nanocrystals appear. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results evidenced the well-defined formation of Zn(Cu)O-Ag and/or CuO-ZnO-Ag heterojunctions. UV-vis spectra display that the visible absorption of the samples is obviously enhanced after the Cu introduction. At a low Cu doping level (0.2%) and moderate Cu concentration (3%-5%), the blue and green photoluminescence (PL) emission strength of the samples becomes very weak in comparison to other samples, indicative of the high separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Reasonably, the higher photocatalytic degradation (complete degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) within 40 min under the simulated sunlight irradiation) are achieved in these cases: low Cu doping level (0.2%) and moderate Cu concentration (3%-5%) in CZA NPs. Further, we checked the effects of other factors on the photocatalytic degradation for possible application. Our results suggest that one well-designed composite type such as element-doped Zn(M)O-Ag nano-heterojunction or complicated metal oxide-ZnO-Ag nanocomposites possessing suitable band structures for the separation and utilization of photo-generated carriers, will remarkably improve the photocatalytic performance of nano-ZnO under sunlight irradiation.

AB Given increasing concern about climate change, the trend toward low-carbon urban transport development has global appeal. The evaluation of low-carbon urban transport is a prerequisite for a transition toward low-carbon urban transport. However, most of the existing research focuses only on the absolute evaluation of urban transport CO2 emissions, which do not represent the level of low-carbon urban transport. In addition, an absolute evaluation is not comparable across different cities over time because it ignores the effects of urban heterogeneity. Therefore, this paper develops a comparative evaluation method that considers the effects of urban population scale, population density and economic development. A benchmark model of per capita CO2 emissions for different cities with different properties is established based on the relationships between urban population scale, population density, and economic development. Then, a comparative evaluation index is derived from the benchmark model to independently evaluate the effects of policy factors, which may reflect the level of low-carbon urban transport. As a result, cities with low-carbon urban transport can be identified. Furthermore, four urban transport transition types are identified: stable high-carbon transitions, stable low-carbon transitions, low-carbon transitions, and high-carbon transitions. These methods are applied to 180 cities worldwide to verify their effectiveness. This is the first time that 180 global cities have been compared using a unified and quantitative evaluation index of low-carbon urban transport.

AB The importance of CF3-containing molecules in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials intrigues the intense interest in synthetic methodology of these compounds. With a purpose to enrich trifluoromethylation methodology, we carefully examined the substrate scope of hydroxytrifluoromethylation of alkenes using iodotrifluoromethane, and the reaction provided beta-trifluoromethyl alcohols in good yields under extremely mild conditions without catalysts. We found that our reaction can be applied to not only styrenes but also various aliphatic alkenes with excellent selectivity; no ketone was detected in most of our cases. Another feature of our discovery is "simple". The reaction was carried out in air, irradiated by visible light, at room temperature and most importantly no catalyst was needed. A solution of CF3I in DMSO was used as the facile trifluoromethylating reagent, which simplified the utilization of gaseous CF3I. Based on F-19 NMR spectroscopy, we observed a halogen bond between CF3I and tertiary amine in this reaction. The interaction may promote single electron transfer by the visible light irradiation.

AB Three different kinds of polyurethane (PU) micelles, i.e. PEG-c-PU, PEG-g-PU and PEG-b-PU, with hydrophobic PCL core and hydrophilic PEG corona were prepared by self-assembly method. DLS studies illustrated that PEGg-PU micelles showed pH dependent surface charge switching properties while no obvious surface charge switching activities were found for PEG-b-PU and PEG-c-PU micelles. Triclosan was loaded into PCL core by dialysis method with pretty high encapsulate content and efficiency and the payloads were released at an accelerate rate in the presence of lipase. MIC and MSC studies demonstrated an enhanced antibacterial activity of encapsulated Triclosan against planktonic bacteria than free Triclosan. CISM images of S. am-eus biofilms treated with Nile red loaded PU micelles illustrated the penetration and accumulation of PEG-g-PU micelles inside the bacterial biofilms at an acidic environment. In addition, Triclosan loaded into PEG-g-PU micelles showed more potent antibiofilm activities than that loaded into PEG-c-PEG and PEG-b-PU micelles. Therefore, the PEG-g-PU micelles can be potentially used as hydrophobic antibiotic carriers to treat bacterial infections and biofilms.

AB The high toxicity, poor stability, premature drug release, and lack of intracellular stimuli responsibility of current polymeric micelles still hinder them for potential clinical applications. To address these challenges, a novel type of multi-stimuli responsive, core cross-linked polypeptide hybrid micelles (CCMs) was developed for triggered anticancer drug delivery in tumor microenvironment. The CCMs was prepared via free radical copolymerization by using N,N'-methylene-bis-acylamide (BACy) as the cross-linking agent, 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as the initiator, where poly (gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPPAM) as comonomers. The doxorubicin (DOX) was then introduced into the CCMs by hydrazone bond to prepare the drug-incorporated core cross-linked micelles (CCMs-DOX). By the experimental results, the CCMs showed reduction responsibility due to the degradable disulfide bond in the polymer network. The hydrazone bond can be broken under acidic condition causing a controllable drug release for CCMs-DOX. Compared to only 7.7% DOX release under pH 7.4 at 37 degrees C, a much higher DOX release rate up to 85.3% was observed under 10 mM GSH (pH 5.0, 42 degrees C). In vitro cell assays showed that the blank CCMs showed almost no toxicity against HUVEC cells while the CCMS-DOX exhibited significant cancer cell killing effect. These experimental results suggested that the prepared multi-stimuli responsive polymeric micelles could serve as a smart and promising drug delivery candidate for anti-cancer therapy.

AB The intestinal mucosal development of piglets (Sus scrofa) during the weaning stage is important to their disease susceptibility and later growth. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is commonly used to screen for differentially expressed genes and, for accurate results, proper reference housekeeping genes are essential. Here we assessed the mRNA expression of 18 well-known candidate reference genes at different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of piglets during the weaning process by RT-qPCR assay. GeNorm analysis revealed that B2M/HMBS/HPRT1 were the three most stable reference genes and GAPDH was the least stable gene in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and whole GIT. Best-Keeper analysis found that B2M/HMBS/PGK11, HMBS/B2M/HPRT1, B2M/HMBS/HSPCB, B2M/HPRT1/HMBS, and B2M/HMBS/HPRT1 were the most stable genes in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and whole GIT, respectively, whereas GAPDH, B-actin, and 18S rRNA were the least stable genes at different parts of the GIT. To confirm the crucial role of appropriate housekeeping genes in obtaining reliable results, we analyzed the expression of ALP using each of the 18 reference genes to normalize the RT-qPCR data. We found that the expression levels of ALP normalized using the most stable reference genes (B2M/ HMBS/HPRT1) differed greatly from the expression levels obtained when the data were normalized using the least stable genes (GAPDH, B-actin, and 18S). We concluded that B2M/ HMBS/HPRT1 were the optimal reference genes for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR in the intestinal mucosal development stages of piglets at weaning. Our findings provide a set of porcine housekeeping reference genes for studies of mRNA expression in different parts of the pig intestine.

AB Polyurethane micelles with disulfide linkage located at the interface of hydrophilic shell and hydrophobic core (PU-SS-I) have been shown enhanced drug release profiles. However, the payloads could not be released completely. The occurrence of aggregation of hydrophobic cores upon shedding hydrophilic PEG coronas was considered as the reason for the incomplete release. To verify the above hypothesis and to develop a new polyurethane based micelles with dual stimuli respond properties and controllable location of pH and reduction responsive groups in the PU main chains, a tertiary amine was incorporated into the hydrophobic core PU-SS-I, which resulted polyurethane with both reduction and pH sensitive properties (PU-SS-N). Biodegradable polyurethane with only disulfide linkages located between the hydrophilic PEG segment and the hydrophobic PCL segments (PU-SS-I) and polyurethane with only pH sensitive tertiary amine at the hydrophobic core (PU-N-C) were used as comparisons. Paclitaxel (PTX) was chosen as mode hydrophobic drug to evaluate the loading and redox triggered release profiles of the PU micelles. It was demonstrated that PU-SS-N micelles disassembled instantly at the presence of 10 mM GSH and at an acidic environment (pH = 5.5), which resulted the nearly complete release (similar to 90%) of the payloads within 48 h, while about similar to 70% PTX was released from PU-SS-I and PU-SS-N micelles at neutral environment (pH = 7.4) with the presence of 10 mM GSH. The rapid and complete redox and pH stimuli release properties of the PU-SS-N nanocarrier will be a promising anticancer drug delivery system to ensure sufficient drug concentration to kill the cancer cells and to prevent the emergency of MDR. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake of the PTX-loaded micelles was also assessed in H460 and HepG2 cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of micro-spherical LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4/C (LMFP) cathode materials are synthesized via co-precipitation method combining spray drying and solid-state reaction. All as-prepared materials are well-characterized to determine their crystal structure, morphology and electrochemical performance. All as-obtained LMFP materials correspond to orthorhombic olivine structure with Pbnm space group and show uniform porous spherical structure with an average particle size of 3 gm and a carbon coating layer of about 3 nm. In particular, the resulting LMFP material prepared at 600 degrees C exhibits a high discharge capacity of 160 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Even at a high rate of 10 C, it can still deliver 133 mAh g(-1) and maintain capacity retention of 84.9% after 200 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergetic effect of porous micro-spherical structure and uniform carbon coating layer.

AB Background
   Yaks (Bos grunniens) are endemic species that can adapt well to thin air, cold temperatures, and high altitude. These species can survive in harsh plateau environments and are major source of animal production for local residents, being an important breed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, compared with ordinary cattle that live in the plains, yaks generally have lower fertility. Investigating the basic physiological molecular features of yak ovary and identifying the biological events underlying the differences between the ovaries of yak and plain cattle is necessary to understand the specificity of yak reproduction. Therefore, RNA-seq technology was applied to analyze transcriptome data comparatively between the yak and plain cattle estrous ovaries.
   Results
   After deep sequencing, 3,653,032 clean reads with a total of 4,828,772,880 base pairs were obtained from yak ovary library. Alignment analysis showed that 16992 yak genes mapped to the yak genome, among which, 12,731 and 14,631 genes were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Furthermore, comparison of yak and cattle ovary transcriptome data revealed that 1307 genes were significantly and differentially expressed between the two libraries, wherein 661 genes were upregulated and 646 genes were downregulated in yak ovary. Functional analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were involved in various Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. GO annotations indicated that the genes related to "cell adhesion," "hormonal" biological processes, and "calcium ion binding," "cation transmembrane transport" molecular events were significantly active. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the "complement and coagulation cascade" pathway was the most enriched in yak ovary transcriptome data, followed by the "cytochrome P450" related and "ECM-receptor interaction" pathways. Moreover, several novel pathways, such as "circadian rhythm," were significantly enriched despite having no evident associations with the reproductive function.
   Conclusion
   Our findings provide a molecular resource for further investigation of the general molecular mechanism of yak ovary and offer new insights to understand comprehensively the specificity of yak reproduction.

AB High cross-taxon congruence in species diversity patterns is essential for the use of surrogate taxa in biodiversity conservation, but presence and strength of congruence in species turnover patterns, and the relative contributions of abiotic environmental factors and biotic interaction towards this congruence, remain poorly understood. In our study, we used variation partitioning in multiple regressions to quantify cross-taxon congruence in community dissimilarities of vascular plants, geometrid and arciinid moths and carabid beetles, subsequently investigating their respective underpinning by abiotic factors and biotic interactions. Significant cross-taxon congruence observed across all taxon pairs was linked to their similar responses towards elevation change. Changes in the vegetation composition were closely linked to carabid turnover, with vegetation structure and associated microclimatic conditions proposed causes of this link. In contrast, moth assemblages appeared to be dominated by generalist species whose turnover was weakly associated with vegetation changes. Overall, abiotic factors exerted a stronger influence on cross-taxon congruence across our study sites than biotic interactions. The weak congruence in turnover observed particularly between plants and moths highlights the importance of multi-taxon approaches based on groupings of taxa with similar turnovers, rather than the use of single surrogate taxa or environmental proxies, in biodiversity assessments.

AB Forty-eight weanling barrows were used to determine the effects of amount and source of dietary Cu on Cu metabolism, oxidative stress in the duodenum, and VFA ratios in the cecum of weanling pigs in short-term feeding. At 21 d of age, newly weaned pigs were stratified by BW ( 7.03 +/- 1.20 kg) and equally assigned to 1 of the following dietary treatments: 1) control (5 mg supplemental Cu/kg diet from CuSO4), 2) 225 mg supplemental Cu/kg diet from CuSO4, or 3) 225 mg supplemental Cu/kg diet from tribasic Cu chloride (TBCC). Pigs were housed 2 pigs per pen and were fed a complex diet until harvest on d 11 and 12. During harvest, bile and liver were obtained for mineral analysis, and liver samples were obtained for analysis of mRNA expression of Cu regulatory proteins. Digesta of duodenum, proximal jejunum, and ileum were collected for soluble Cu analysis. Mucosal scrapings of duodenum, proximal jejunum, and ileum were obtained for analysis of mucosal Cu concentration and mRNA expression of Cu regulatory proteins. Duodenal mucosal scrapings were also collected for analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA). Pigs fed high Cu had markedly greater (P < 0.0001) Cu concentrations in the duodenal, proximal jejunal, and ileal mucosa than controls. Copper in the duodenal mucosa was greater (P = 0.003) in CuSO4 than TBCC pigs. Duodenal MDA concentrations were greater (P = 0.003) in CuSO4 vs. control pigs and tended (P = 0.06) to be greater than in TBCC pigs. Duodenal antioxidant 1 (Atox1) mRNA was downregulated (P < 0.01) in pigs fed high Cu compared to controls and was not affected by Cu source. Compared with control pigs, those fed CuSO4 and TBCC had greater (P < 0.001) liver and bile Cu concentrations. Liver Cu was also greater (P = 0.0007) in TBCC than CuSO4-fed pigs. Hepatic Cu transporting beta-polypeptide ATPase (Atp7b) was upregulated (P = 0.02) in the Cu-supplemented pigs compared with controls and did not differ among Cu sources. The acetate: propionate ratio in cecal contents was much greater in pigs supplemented with 225 mg Cu/kg diet than in controls. When fed at 225 mg Cu/kg diet, TBCC may cause less oxidative stress in the duodenum than CuSO4. Feeding weanling pigs increased Cu resulted in modulation of duodenal Atox1 and liver Atp7b at the transcription level.

AB Drug-dependent design of hydrogels is currently required for engineering the controlled release of therapeutics, which is a major contributor to the technical challenges relating to the clinical translation of hydrogel-drug systems. Herein, by integrating supramolecular phenolic-based nanofillers (SPFs) into hydrogel microstructures we developed a facile strategy to endow a range of clinically relevant hydrogels with controlled release properties for diverse therapeutic agents. The assembly of multiscale SPF aggregates leads to tunable mesh size and multiple dynamic interactions between SPF aggregates and drugs, which relaxes the available choices of drugs and hydrogels. This simple approach allowed for the controlled release of 12 representative drugs evaluated with 8 commonly used hydrogels. Moreover, the anesthetic drug lidocaine was loaded into SPF-integrated alginate hydrogel and demonstrated sustained release for 14 days in vivo, validating the potential for long-term anesthesia in patients.

AB Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) is a kind of natural hydrophilic polymers derived from Bletilla striata with a history of over 1500 years. Recently, it arouses increasing interest of researchers in both basic research, material design and clinical transformation area, because of its potential pharmacological activ-ities. More importantly, BSP as promising biomaterials exhibits distinct physicochemical properties (e.g. solubility, viscosity, film-forming ability), biocompatibility, biodegradability and structural modifiability. Unmodified BSP is usually made into hydrogels, sponges, microneedles, films and lyophilized wafers alone or composed with other materials, whereas chemical modified BSP is mainly prepared into micelles, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanofibers and biological scaffolds. The diverse BSP-based bioma-terials can be broadly used in wound healing, targeted drug delivery, and tissue engineering, having great research and application values in material science and biomedical engineering. Herein, the research is started with the preparation, characterization and structure properties of BSP. With perspectives for their potential applications, BSP-based biomaterials before and after modification are summarized and empha-sized. Besides, the current challenges and future perspectives of BSP-based biomaterials are also high-lighted. It is envisioned that this review will provide the directions for the further exploitation of BSP as multifunctional materials in biomedicine fields and help to understand the natural biopolymers.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID FREE PIEZOCERAMICS
AB Implantable medical electronics (IMEs) are now becoming increasingly prevalent for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Despite extensive efforts, a primary challenge for IMEs is reliable wireless power and communication to provide well-controlled, therapeutically relevant effects. Ultrasonic energy transfer and communication (UETC) employing traveling ultrasound waves to transmit energy has emerged as a promising wireless strategy for IMEs. Nevertheless, conventional UETC systems are rigid, bulky, and based on toxic lead-based piezoelectric materials, raising efficiency and safety concerns. Here, we present a novel transcutaneous UETC system based on a two-dimensional flexible lead-free piezoelectric array (f-LFPA) that hybridizes high-performance (piezoelectric coefficient d(33) approximate to 503 pC N-1) (K,Na)NbO3-based eco-friendly piezo-units with soft structural components. The newly developed lead-free piezo-unit exhibits submicron ferroelectric domains and superior energy harvesting figures of merit (d(33)g(33) approximate to 20 000 x 10(-15) m(2) N-1), resulting in the prepared f-LFPA demonstrating a high output voltage of 22.4 V, a power density of 0.145 W cm(-2), and a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 30 dB within the FDA safety limits, while maintaining the flexibility for wide-angle receiving. Further ex vivo experiment demonstrates the adequate power supply capabilities of the f-LFPA and its possible application in future implantable eco-friendly bioelectronics for diagnostics, therapy, and real-time monitoring.

AB Blood cell detection in microscopic images is an essential branch of medical image processing research. The research and application of computer vision algorithms in this field are more concerned about the trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. The FED detector modified by YOLOv3 is a representative lightweight model to detect blood cell objects such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. But the detection precision of red blood cells in the FED model is relatively low compared with platelets and white blood cells due to the imbalance distribution of different types of cells. In this research, we propose a light-weight model based on YOLOF to address the relatively low precision of red blood cell detection problem, in order to achieve the overall improvement of detection precision. This object detector is called TE-YOLOF, Tiny and Efficient YOLOF. Model light-weighting is accomplished with the excellent feature extraction capabilities of EfficientNet as backbone and the ability of the Depthwise Separable Convolution to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining precision. Furthermore, the Mish activation function is employed to increase the precision. Extensive experiments on the BCCD dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, which can achieve higher precision with less parameters than FED. TE-YOLOF is also effective on other cross-domain blood cell detection experiments.

AB Elevation gradient can reflect the effects of soil physico-chemical properties on plant species diversity. Alpine grassland on the QTP has suffered from a serious decline in plant species diversity. In this study, we investigated 112 sites recording plant community characteristics and collecting soil samples along an elevation gradient (3,500-5,200 m asl) in alpine meadow on the QTP. We analyzed the effects of soil physico-chemical properties on plant species composition and diversity by canonical ordination and spatial regression along an elevation gradient. The results showed that species richness of the overall plant communities decreased with the increasing elevation, and the Simpson dissimilarity index (beta(sim)) had a maximum at low elevation (3,500-4,000 m) with the value of 0.37. Soil available nitrogen content was the primary soil parameter affecting plant species composition and diversity in alpine grassland. The effect of soil available nitrogen content on plant species richness varied at different elevations. For Gramineae plants (G), plant species richness declined with the increase in soil available nitrogen content at low elevation (3,500-4,000 m), but rose at middle elevation (4,000-4,500 m). Soil available nitrogen content had a more significant limiting effect on species richness at high elevation (>4,500 m). These findings increase our understanding about the drivers of plant species diversity changes in alpine grassland on the QTP, and will provide insights into grassland restoration and sustainable management.

TI Probability-based Mask R-CNN for pulmonary embolism detection
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Small object detection; Pulmonary embolism; Medical image; Deep learning
AB Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage of the lung artery, is common and sometimes fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment of PE can reduce the risk of associated morbidity and mortality. However, it is a huge chal-lenge to accurately detect PE, particularly for the case of small segmental and subsegmental emboli. In this paper, a flexible probability-based Mask R-CNN model, namely P-Mask RCNN, is proposed for PE detection. Specifically, the feature map is firstly upsampled to enrich the local details of the small objects and to extract anchors at a higher density. Then, a candidate area is constructed based on the probability of the appearance of PE. Finally, we extract the anchors in the candidate area of the enlarged feature map for subsequent detection. Extracting anchors in the candidate area instead of the entire image can not only reduce both time and space consumption caused by the enlarging feature maps but also improve the detection performance by eliminating most invalid anchors. Compared with Mask R-CNN, the anchors extracted by the proposed P-Mask RCNN is closer to the ground truth. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The source code of our method is available athttps://github.com/longkun-uestc/P_Mask_RCNN.

AB With their unique reactivity, selectivity, availability and stability, allenamides are receiving increasing attention, and reports on the functionalization of allenamides are rapidly growing in number. In this review, recent developments in transition-metal-free functionalization of allenamides are highlighted. First, developments based on allenamide reactivity are simply introduced. After presenting the advantages of allenamides, recent progress in transition-metal-free functionalization of allenamides is classified and discussed in detail in four parts: chiral phosphoric-acid-catalyzed asymmetric functionalization, iodine-reagent-mediated functionalization, 1,3-H-shift reaction of allenamides, and other metal-free allenamide functionalizations. For the majority of these transformations, plausible mechanisms are presented in detail. The purpose of this review is to provide illustrations of elegant allenamide chemistry, and thereby elicit further interest from the synthetic community to develop novel allenamide methodology.

AB Background: Breast cancer is the most common female cancer with considerable metastatic potential, which urges the need for developing novel potential drug candidate to inhibit tumor metastasis. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) have critical roles in cancer growth and metastasis and have been confirmed as a promising anticancer target. Here, we report our finding with pectolinarigenin, a flavonoid compound isolated from the aerial parts of Cirsium chanroenicum.
   Methods: The role of Pec. in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell migration and invasion in three breast cancer cells (4T1, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7) was investigated. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay, cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and protein expression was detected by western blotting. Tumor xenograft mice model and breast tumor metastasis model in vivo were built to further assess the effects of Pec. on 4T1 cells.
   Results: Intraperitoneal administrations of pectolinarigenin significantly inhibited breast cancer metastasis to lungs without affecting the tumor growth of incubated 4T1 breast cancer cells. Pectolinarigenin could also recruit CD8+ T cells to mediate tumor immune response. Furthermore, pectolinarigenin markedly impaired cancer cell migration and invasion by down-regulating phosphorylated-Stat3, and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, while up-regulating the expression of TIMP2. We also found that pectolinarigenin inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via mitochondrial-related apoptosis pathway, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression of Bcl-2, increased expression of Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 as well as disturbed the ROS generation.
   Conclusions: Pectolinarigenin might potentially be a candidate for metastasis of breast cancer by mediating Stat3 pathway.

AB A strategy of controlling individual pollutants without considering synergistic effects and ancillary benefit/cost has been followed in the course of air pollution control in China. This policy orientation could lead to divided and costly technology pathways. In this paper, the coal-fired power sector is used as a representative case to investigate the technology schemes and assess their cost effectiveness, so as to provide empirical evidence of technology synergies' impacts on cost-effectiveness and to shed light on the future directions for pollution control strategies. The results indicate that more pollution damage caused by particulate matter and mercury, could be avoided at less cost if the proposed technology schemes can be used more instead of the current mainstream scheme in this sector at the beginning of air pollution regulation. It implies that more detailed evaluation of technology schemes is needed to better control multiple pollutants and alleviate various negative health endpoint effects. The transformation of strategy will rely on a combination of technological developments and policy changes. The lessons learned from coal-fired power sector can contribute to policy-making across sectors within the industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antimicrobial activity is an attractive property for packaging materials which can extend the shelf life of products and provide microbial safety for consumers. The study aimed to analyze the physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of gelatin-based edible films containing trans-anethole as the active additive. Encapsulation with beta-cyclodextrin was used as an effective way to introduce trans-anethole into gelatin matrix. The results showed that the trans-anethole/beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex could be evenly dispersed in the gelatin-based edible films with appropriate addition. The incorporation of trans-anethole conferred the edible films with good antimicrobial activity as expected, which increased with the content of trans-anethole increasing. Moreover, the addition of inclusion complex improved the tensile strength and surface hydrophobicity and reduced the moisture content of the edible films. It was interesting that the edible films presented great UV light barrier property and it was increased by the addition of inclusion complex. Overall, the antimicrobial gelatin-based edible films showed great potential as bioactive packaging materials to extend food shelf life.

AB Porous bowl-like LiFePO4/C composites are prepared by using the ammonium salt and sodium salt processes with a facile precipitation method coupled with spray-drying technology. Both of the as-prepared LiFePO4/C composites present high crystallinity, bowl-like morphology, and uniform carbon-layer-coated particles. Compared with the traditional ammonium salt process, the sodium salt process, without ammonia nitrogen pollutants, is not only environmentally friendly, but also allows us to introduce appropriate Na+ doping within the resultant LiFePO4. Moreover, the LiFePO4/C composite prepared by using the sodium salt process exhibits better electrochemical performance: a high rate capability (136, 129, and 119 mAhg(-1) at 10, 20, and 40 C rate, respectively) and a long cycle stability (60.3% of initial capacity after 3000 cycles at 10 C, only corresponding to 0.013% capacity decay per cycle) compared with the other (only exhibits a capacity of 123, 107, and 62 mAhg(-1) at rate of 10, 20, and 40 C and retains a 37.5% of initial capacity after 3000 cycles at 10 C). This good electrochemical performance originates from its special morphology, high crystallinity, stable structure, and Na+ doping.

AB To more efficiently identify the microbial community of the yak rumen, the standardization of DNA extraction is key to ensure fidelity while studying environmental microbial communities. In this study, we systematically compared the efficiency of several extraction methods based on DNA yield, purity, and 16S rDNA sequencing to determine the optimal DNA extraction methods whose DNA products reflect complete bacterial communities. The results indicate that method 6 (hexadecyltrimethylammomium bromide-lysozyme-physical lysis by bead beating) is recommended for the DNA isolation of the rumen microbial community due to its high yield, operational taxonomic unit, bacterial diversity, and excellent cell-breaking capability. The results also indicate that the bead-beating step is necessary to effectively break down the cell walls of all of the microbes, especially Gram-positive bacteria. Another aim of this study was to preliminarily analyze the bacterial community via 16S rDNA sequencing. The microbial community spanned approximately 21 phyla, 35 classes, 75 families, and 112 genera. A comparative analysis showed some variations in the microbial community between yaks and cattle that may be attributed to diet and environmental differences. Interestingly, numerous uncultured or unclassified bacteria were found in yak rumen, suggesting that further research is required to determine the specific functional and ecological roles of these bacteria in yak rumen. In summary, the investigation of the optimal DNA extraction methods and the preliminary evaluation of the bacterial community composition of yak rumen support further identification of the specificity of the rumen microbial community in yak and the discovery of distinct gene resources.

AB Alkaline methanol-water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro-reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy-consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)(2) lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH-, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43 V at 500 mA cm(-2), along with high stability over 72 h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76 mV to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane-free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability and FEs at high current density of 300 mA cm(-2). This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.

AB A comprehensive study of the overall flavor and taste profile of different radishes is lacking. This study systematically compared the volatile profile of six radish varieties using HS-GC-IMS and their correlation with the Enose analysis. Organic acids and amino acids were quantified, and their association with the E-tongues analysis was explored. A total of 73 volatile compounds were identified, with diallyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide being the primary sulfides responsible for the unpleasant flavor in radish. Compared to other varieties, cherry radishes boast a significantly higher concentration of allyl isothiocyanate, which likely contributes to their characteristic radish flavor. Moreover, oxalic acid was identified as the most abundant organic acid in radish, accounting for over 97% of its content, followed by malic acid and succinic acid. In conclusion, the distinct flavor and taste characteristics of different radish varieties partially explain their suitability for diverse culinary preferences.

AB The fermentation of kiwifruit into kiwi wine (KW) can represent a strategy to reduce the economic losses linked to fruits imperfections, spoilage, over production and seasonality. In the study, Pujiang kiwifruit, a China National Geographical Indication Product, was used as raw material to produce KW fermented by four commercial S. cerevisiae strains, namely Drop Acid Yeast, DV10, SY and RW. The sensory characteristics and flavor profile of KW were assessed by means of sensory evaluation, E-tongue, GC-IMS and 1H-NMR. KW fermented by RW strain obtained the higher sensory evaluation score. E-tongue could clearly distinguish the taste differences of KW fermented by distinct S. cerevisiae strains. A total of 128 molecules were characterized by GC-IMS and 1H-NMR, indicating that the combinations of multiple technologies could provide a comprehensive flavor profile of KW. The main flavor compounds in KW pertained to the classes of esters and alcohols. Several pathways were found to be differently altered by the fermentation with the different yeast strains, namely butanoate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism. The present study will facilitate screening suitable S. cerevisiae strains for KW production and provide a theoretical basis for large-scale production of KW.

AB Background: There is increasing interest in identifying factors to predict posttraumatic growth (PTG), a positive psychological response following traumatic events (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic). Grit, a psychological trait of perseverance and passion to pursue long-term goals, has emerged as a promising predictor for PTG. This study aimed to examine the functional connectivity markers of grit and the potential brain-grit mechanism in pre-dicting PTG.Methods: Baseline brain imaging scans and grit scale and other controlling measures were administered in 100 normal young adults before the COVID-19 pandemic, and follow-up PTG measurement was obtained during the period of community-level outbreak. Whole-brain correlation analysis and prediction analysis were used to identify the brain regions whose functional connectivity density (FCD) related to individuals' grit scores. Mediation analyses were performed to explore the mediation relation between FCD, grit and PTG.Results: Grit was positively related to FCD in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a core hub implicated in self-regulation and reward-motivation processes. Furthermore, grit mediated the effect of right DLPFC FCD on COVID-related PTG. These results survived controlling for self-control and family socioeconomic status.Limitations: Our study is limited by only one-session neuroimaging data and self-reported behavioral measures in a sample of normal adults.Conclusions: This study indicates grit and right DLPFC FCD as neuropsychological contributors for the devel-opment of PTG. It deepens our understanding of the neural bases of grit, and may have clinical potential to develop targeted brain interventions aimed at improving grit to raise PTG and mental health during the pandemic.

AB Supported metal (oxide) clusters, with both rich surface sites and high atom utilization efficiency, have shown improved activity and selectivity for many catalytic reactions over nanoparticle and single atom catalysts. Yet, the role of cluster catalysts has been rarely reported in CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR), which is a promising route for converting CO2 to liquid fuels like formic acid with renewable electricity. Here we develop a bismuth oxide (BiOn) cluster catalyst for highly efficient CO2RR to formate. The BiOn cluster catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability towards formate production, with a formate Faradaic efficiency of over 90% at a current density up to 500 mA.cm(-2) in an alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, corresponding to a mass activity as high as 3,750 A.gBi(-1). The electrolyzer with the BiOn cluster catalyst delivers a remarkable formate production rate of 0.56 mmol.min(-1) at a high single-pass CO2 conversion of 44%. Density functional theory calculations indicate that Bi4O3 cluster is more favorable for stabilizing the HCOO* intermediate than Bi(001) surface and single site BiC4 motif, rationalizing the improved formate production over the BiOn cluster catalyst. This work highlights the great importance of cluster catalysts in activity and selectivity control in electrocatalytic CO2 conversion.

TI A novel tongue segmentation method based on improved U-Net

ID DIAGNOSIS; COVID-19; NETWORK
AB Background and objective: Accurate segmentation of tongue image is a prerequisite to intelligent tongue diagnosis. Current tongue segmentation algorithms have good performances in tongue image segmentation in a standard environment. However, tongue segmentation is still challenging to be used in an open environment due to factors such as the complex external open environment and relatively simple equipment. This study aims to construct a novel deep neural network tongue segmentation system suitable for mobile devices, which performs tongue segmentation rapidly in an open environment.Methods: Firstly, a new OET-NET is constructed based on U-Net combined with a residual soft connection module and salient image fusion module to train the tongue image from a different device. Secondly, a new loss function is established based on the Focal loss. Finally, the number of network parameters, the inferred time are treated as indicators to evaluate the model. At the same time, MIoU, precision, recall, F1-Score and FLOPs are used to compare with different tongue segmentation frameworks.Results: According to the training results, the proposed OET-NET's parameter number is 7.75 MB, the required time of tongue segmentation is about 59 ms/piece, the MIoU is 96.98% and the FLOPs is 15.50 MFLOPs. Compared with U-Net, OET-NET increased the total number of parameters by 0.39 MB and the inference time by 1 ms/piece, but achieved the best segmentation effect compared with the reference models.Conclusions: According to less time consumption and less space, the precision of segmentation results is higher than that of other segmentation models. OET-NET can quickly and accurately extract tongue bodies from the open environment, and its relatively smaller number of model parameters made it suitable for mobile devices. It is potential for OET-NET to be applied to tongue image segmentation on mobile terminals.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Named data networking (NDN) is one representation and implementation of information-centric networking (ICN) and is considered to be among the most promising designs for the next generation of network architecture. The introduction of NDN into vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and utilization of its content-centric characteristic to improve data transmission and distribution in VANETs has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, research on mobility support of NDN-based VANETs still faces many challenges. To solve the issue of data transmission path breaking due to Consumer mobility in NDN-based VANETs, this article proposes a novel vehicle tracking-based Data packet forwarding scheme (VTDF) to improve the successful delivery rate of Data packets in mobile environments. In this approach, the urban road structure is divided into complex multi-junction and straight lane scenarios and Data packets are forwarded according to vehicle movement information. Simulations indicated that this vehicle tracking scheme provides a lower average data transmission delay, shorter handover delay between roadside units, and higher data delivery rate for Consumers compared to the standard methods.

AB Background and aims Uncontrolled uptake of Na+ is the reason that many species are sensitive to salinity. Suberin is a protective barrier found in the walls of root endodermal cells that appears to be important for salt tolerance, yet its specific protective mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Methods Here we investigated the role of aliphatic suberin in protecting plants against salt stress by using a mutant of Arabidopsis, cyp86a1, which exhibits a significant reduction of root aliphatic suberin. Results We found that NaCl significantly increased suberization in roots of hydroponic-grown wild-type plants, but not in cyp86a1. Cyp86a1 exhibited a salt-sensitive phenotype. Compared with wild-type, Na+ accumulation in shoots was higher in cyp86a1. We provide evidence that increased Na+ uptake was via the root transcellular pathway. Furthermore, cyp86a1 accumulated less K+ in shoots than wild-type under NaCl stress, which was a consequence of increased K+ efflux from the root vasculature. Additionally, we provide evidence that aliphatic suberin reduces inflow of water across the root endodermis under non-stress conditions but reduces the backflow of water to the medium under salt stress. Conclusions Finally, we propose a model for the role of aliphatic suberin in restricting Na+ influx, K+ efflux and water backflow in plants under saline conditions.

AB The effects of microwave cooking on the changes of physical properties, protein denaturation, microstructure and volatiles of yak meat were investigated. Various microwave power settings were used for cooking the yak longissimus meats, and SDS-PAGE, cooking loss, colour difference, shear force, microstructure and volatile flavour compounds of longissimus muscle were evaluated. Cooking losses (37.03-45.92%) and shear forces (257.20-315.57 N) in microwave heated meats were higher and lower, respectively, than these in boiled meats (p < .05). Cooking loss, a* values, and shear force significantly (p < .05) increased as the prolonged microwave cooking time, while L* value decreased (p < .05) and more muscle fibres fractured and contracted. High power (700 W; 100%) microwave cooked yak meat had higher L* values, but lower a* values and shear force than meats cooked at medium (560 W; 80%) or low (420 W; 60%) settings. Significant higher cooking loss and volatiles were found in medium power cooked meats compared to high and low power groups. The results suggested that microwave cooking could yield yak meat product with better texture and volatiles attributes but higher cooking loss and decolorization compared to conventional boiling cooking, and maybe an applicable processing method to obtain high quality yak meat products.

TI Biodegradable multi-blocked polyurethane micelles for intracellular drug

AB Biodegradable multi-blocked polyurethane (PU) based micelles with redox responsive properties have been widely used as anticancer drug delivery systems due to their customizable molecular structures. Disulfide bonds can be easily introduced into the hard segment of polyurethanes by conventional two-step polymerization processes, which result in a random distribution of the reduction responsive disulfide linkages on polyurethanes. We speculated that the disassembly and drug release profiles of polyurethane micelles were related to the location of the disulfide linkages on the polymer main chain. To this end, two kinds of redox responsive polyurethane micelles with the same quantity of disulfide bonds but at different locations were prepared: (i) most of the disulfide bonds located at the hydrophobic core of the polyurethane micelles (PU-SS-C) and (ii) disulfide bonds located primarily at the interface between the hydrophobic core and the hydrophilic shell (PU-SS-I). Paclitaxel (PTX) was chosen as the model hydrophobic drug to evaluate the loading and redox-triggered release of the PU micelles. It was demonstrated that the PU-SS-I micelles disassembled simultaneously in response to a 10 mM glutathione (GSH) stimulus and the payloads released more rapidly than that of PU-SS-C nanocarriers. The results show that the release profiles of PU based nanocarriers can be optimized by the location of the disulfide on the polyurethane main chain. The rapid redox-stimulated release properties of the PU-SS-I nanocarriers will be a promising anticancer drug delivery system to ensure sufficient drug concentration to kill the cancer cell and to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR). In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated the cellular uptake of doxorubicin-loaded(DOX-loaded) micelles and the GSH-responsive intracellular release of DOX. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake of the PTX-loaded micelles was also assessed in H460 cells.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effect of forage: concentrate ratio (F:C) on growth performance, ruminal fermentation and blood metabolites of housing-feeding yaks. Thirty-two Maiwa male yaks (initial body weight = 207.99 +/- 3.31 kg) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments (8 yaks per treatment). Experimental diets were: A, B, C, D which contained 70: 30, 60: 40, 50: 50 and 40: 60 F: C ratios, respectively. Dry matter intake and average daily gain in yaks fed the C and D diets were greater (p<0.05) than yaks fed the A and B diets. No differences were found in ruminal NH3-N, total volatile fatty acids, acetate, butyrate, valerate, and isovalerate concentrations. The propionate concentration was increased (p<0.05) in the C and D groups compared with the A and B diets. In contrast, the acetate to propionate ratio was decreased and was lowest (p<0.05) in the C group relative to the A and B diets, but was similar with the D group. For blood metabolites, no differences were found in serum concentrations of urea-N, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase (p>0.05) among treatments. Treatment C had a higher concentration of total protein and high density lipoprotein (p<0.05) than A and B groups. In addition, there was a trend that the globulin concentration of A group was lower than other treatments (p = 0.079). Results from this study suggest that increasing the level of concentrate from 30% to 50% exerted a positive effect on growth performance, rumen fermentation and blood metabolites in yaks.

AB Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a complex and heterogeneous neoplasm, and till now no effective therapies are available. PARP inhibitors, which target DNA repair, are lethal to those cells that have impaired homologous recombination (HR) pathway. So, PARP inhibitors might exert promising results in the treatment of BRCA-mutated TNBC, but show compromised effect to those wild-type TNBC. Herein, we describe a novel PROTACs C8, which was obtained by conjugating PARP1/2 inhibitor Olaparib to KB02, can induce potent and specific degradation of PARP2 by recruiting DCAF16 E3 ligase for treatment of wild-type TNBC. Moreover, C8 exhibits therapeutic potential in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 both in vitro and in vivo. These studies demonstrated that the DCAF16 E3 ligases can be used in PARP2 PROTACs design, and C8, as a novel PARP2 selective DCAF16 based PROTACs, might be a promising lead compound for the treatment of BRCA-wild-type TNBC.

AB The integrated stress response (ISR) is an adaptational signaling pathway induced in response to different stimuli, such as accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins, hypoxia, amino acid deprivation, viral infection, and ultraviolet light. It has been known that viral infection can activate the ISR, but the role of the ISR during viral infection is still unclear. In some cases, the ISR is a protective mechanism of host cells against viral infection, while viruses may hijack the ISR for facilitating their replication. This review highlighted recent advances on the induction of the ISR upon viral infection and the downstream responses, such as autophagy, apoptosis, formation of stress granules, and innate immunity response. We then discussed the molecular mechanism of the ISR regulating viral replication and how viruses antagonize this cellular stress response resulting from the ISR.

AB The traditional tourism industry is in urgent need of digital technologies for cost reduction and efficiency enhancement. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, is promising to reform the tourism industry because it provides a trustworthy platform to link the tourism company and tourists. However, the existing blockchainbased smart tourism solutions are either conceptual or limited in solving the fundamental tourism challenges. In this paper, we propose BlockTour, a blockchain-based smart tourism platform with dedicated solution to address the challenges and real-world prototype deployment. In particular, we design the overall system architecture of BlockTour to link the tourists and attractions in a trustworthy way. Moreover, an efficient consensus mechanism is designed with incentives for the tourists to explore more attractions. Finally, we implement BlockTour and conduct extensive experiments for performance evaluation. The experimental results indicate that BlockTour is a practical and high-performance smart tourism platform.

AB Mequindox (Meq) is a promising broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, but the clinical application of Meq has been hampered by its low oral bioavailability. Casein (Cas) can bind to a variety of poorly water-soluble drugs to improve their water solubility through a micellar solubilization mechanism. Here, a low-cost and convenient method was introduced to prepare mequindox-loaded casein nanoparticles (Meq-Cas). Meq-Cas was characterized by several methods including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) to illuminate the mutual effect between the drug and carriers. Meq-Cas presented nearly spherical nanoparticles with smooth surfaces and its mean particle size was lower than untreated Cas. Meq-Cas showed a nearly complete release of Meq, which displayed a biphasic drug release pattern in both phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and simulated gastric fluid (SGF). The relative oral bioavailability of Meq-Cas was found to be about 1.20 times higher than that of the animals treated with Meq suspension (control). These results suggest that Cas is a good candidate to load in Meq for pharmaceutical purposes.

In the process of building heating, passive design measures and active heating systems (AHS) are always working together. To optimize the heating performance, it is necessary to coordinate the relationship between passive design measures and the AHS. However, it is impossible to obtain the specific quantitative optimized relationship between passive design measures and AHS based on existing research methods. To address this lack of knowledge, a collaborative optimization design method (CODM) is proposed in this paper to optimize the cost and the energy consumption of heating in the life cycle of the building. In CODM, comprehensive effects of passive design measures and the AHS on the total cost and the total energy consumption for building heating are analyzed. A railway passenger station is selected as a case study and results show that compared with initial design, the optimal total heating cost and total heating energy consumption for building heating can reduce 1948 (sic)/m(2) and 2292 kW h/m(2) for the life cycle of the building, respectively.

AB Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are effective antimicrobial reagent, especially for the treatment of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. However, it is difficult to remove the residual harmful reducing agents in AgNPs synthesized by the traditional chemical reduction method. In addition, AgNPs exhibit cytotoxicity when exposed directly to cells for biomedical applications and will rapidly aggregate in aqueous environment. Herein, we develop a new route to synthesize submicron-particles containing AgNPs (kappa C@Ag MPs) with high aqueous stability, robust antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. AgNPs were firstly greenly synthesized using kappa-carrageenan as environmental friendly reducing and stabilizing agent under heating in aqueous solution. Then the AgNPs were immobilized in the net of x-carrageenan by adding KCl to obtain kappa C@Ag MPs. The results indicated that kappa C@Ag MPs were quite stable without any agglomeration and precipitation in aqueous solution for more than three months. kappa C@Ag MPs exhibited robust antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, even better than that of pure AgNPs. Notably, kappa C@Ag MPs maintained the long-lasting retention of antibacterial activity. In addition, kappa C@Ag MPs possessed well cytocompatibility towards the L02 and L929 cells. Overall, kappa C@Ag MPs may have prospective application as effective and sustainable antibacterial agent in biomedical fields.

AB An atom-economical and environmentally benign approach for the synthesis of indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones from indoles and 1,4-naphthoquinones using readily available Lewis acidic B(C6F5)(3) in water and with the recycling of water and part of the catalyst is reported. The reaction proceeded through the B(C6F5)(3)-catalyzed C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(2))-H bond coupling of 1,4-naphthoquinones with the C-3 position of indole derivatives in water. This methodology provides a facile protocol for the synthesis of some new indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones in satisfactory yields and with a broad substrate scope. When compared to known methods for the synthesis of indole-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones, this protocol is practical and efficient and does not require a transition-metal catalyst or toxic organic solvents. In addition, we utilized a simple filtration process for complete recycling of the solvent and the part of the catalyst in each reaction cycle.

AB Background and aims Over-grazing have significantly altered above- and belowground functions in terrestrial ecosystem. However, the influence of grazing intensity on plant-soil stoichiometric relations in alpine ecosystems remains unclear. Methods We investigated the responses of plant-soil nutrient stoichiometric relationships to four grazing intensities (un-grazing (UG), light grazing (LG), moderate grazing (MG) and heavy grazing (HG)) in an alpine meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We measured carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations and their ratios in plants and soils in the peak growing season after three years of yak-grazing. Results Compared to UG and LG plots, heavier grazing intensity at community levels and taxonomic groups decreased plant C and K concentrations by 7.6-10.5% and 17.6-21.3%, respectively, while grazing did not significantly influence plant N and P concentrations. Grazing intensity altered plant C:N and C:P ratios but not C:K and N:P ratios. By contrast, grazing intensity had no significant effects on soil nutrients and stoichiometry. Thus, the differential responses of plant and soil nutrients to grazing intensity caused that plants were more sensitive to grazing than soils. Conclusions Our results confirm that grazing intensity has differential effects on plant and soil nutrients, implying that plant nutrients do not covary with soil nutrients under changing grazing intensity and challenging the past positive relations between plant and soil nutrients. Further long-term grazing experiments are required to understand the drivers of grazing effect on plant-soil nutrient interactions.

AB The short blood circulation time, reduced cellular uptake, and uncontrollable drug release still hinder the polymer micelle as an efficient drug delivery vehicle in clinical applications. In this study, a series of stepwise pH-sensitive and biodegradable polypeptide hybrid terpolymers, poly (lysine-co-N,N-bis(acryloyl) cystamine-codimethylmaleic anhydride) (PLB-DMMA), were designed and synthesized to achieve prolonged circulation time, enhanced cellular uptake and controllable anti-cancer drug release. The synthesized terpolymers can self-assemble into spherical nano-micelles (NMs) with narrow distributions and exhibited stepwise responses to extracellular and intracellular pH condition of the tumor cell. The as prepared NMs showed a negative surface charge under normal physiological conditions exhibiting advantageous stability during blood circulation. By the first-step pH response, the surface charge of the NMs switched from negative to positive to enhance cellular uptake under the slightly acidic tumor extracellular environment. After internalization into tumor cells, the second-step pH response resulted in an endosome escape of the NMs via the "proton-sponge" effect in the acidic endo/lysosome environment. Additionally, a rapid drug release was triggered in response to the intracellular reductive environment of tumor cells via the destruction of disulfide-linked polymer chains to enhance the nucleus delivery of DOX. in vitro cell assays showed that the blank NMs showed negligible systemic toxicity against normal cells while the DOX-loaded NMs significantly inhibited growth of the tumor cells. In general, it was suggested that the as developed stepwise pH-sensitive and biodegradable PLB-DMMA based NMs would be a smart and promising drug delivery candidate for anti-cancer chemotherapy.

AB Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) is an adipokine that is found to participate in the regulation of adipogenesis. However, its function remains to be elucidated in intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition of goat. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of FGF10 in goat IMF deposition. Here, we investigated the expression of FGF10 in goat intramuscular adipocytes inducing 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days. Effect of FGF10 on adipogenesis was investigated by gaining and losing function of FGF10 in vitro. And then, we examined several lipid metabolism-related genes, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBP alpha) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBP beta), as well as, Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family. We found that the sharp expression of FGF10 appeared at 2 days. Overexpression of FGF10 mediated by adenovirus promotes lipid accumulation, accompanied by up-regulating of LPL and C/EBP alpha with the down-regulating of C/EBP beta. Conversely, the expression of LPL, C/EBP alpha and SREBP1 was significantly decreased by the siRNAs of FGF10. Meanwhile, we showed that FGF10 regulated the expression of many KLFs members and interacted synergistically or antagonistically with them. Thus, our results demonstrated a key role of FGF10 as a positively factor in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation of intramuscular preadipocyte in goat.

AB Endogenous hormones and polyamines (PM) could interact to regulate growth and tolerance to water stress in white clover. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the alteration of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) level affected other hormones level and PM metabolism contributing to the regulation of tolerance to water stress in white clover. Plants were pretreated with IAA or L-2-aminooxy-3-phenylpropionic acid (L-AOPP, the inhibitor of IAA biosynthesis) for 3 days and then subjected to water-sufficient condition and water stress induced by 15% polyethylene glycol 6000 for 8 days in growth chambers. Exogenous application of IAA significantly increased endogenous IAA, gibberellin (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and polyamine (PM) levels, but had no effect on cytokinin content under water stress. The increase in endogenous IAA level enhanced PM anabolism via the improvement of enzyme activities and transcript level of genes including arginine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. Exogenous application of IAA also affected PM catabolism, as manifested by an increase in diamine oxidase and a decrease in polyamine oxidase activities and genes expression. More importantly, the IAA deficiency in white clover decreased endogenous hormone levels (GA, ABA, and PM) and PAs anabolism along with decline in antioxidant defense and osmotic adjustment (OA). On the contrary, exogenous IAA effectively alleviated stress-induced oxidative damage, growth inhibition, water deficit, and leaf senescence through the maintenance of higher chlorophyll content, OA, and antioxidant defense as well as lower transcript levels of senescence marker genes SAG101 and SAG102 in leaves under water stress. These results indicate that IAA-induced the crosstalk between endogenous hormones and PM could be involved in the improvement of antioxidant defense and OA conferring tolerance to water stress in white clover.

AB Multifunctional microspheres simultaneously possessing chirality, magnetism and thermosensitivity show great potentials in direct enantiomeric separation. Herein we report a novel type of smart chiral magnetic microspheres with core/shell/shell structures (Fe3O4@SiO2@PNCD) and its application in enantioselective adsorption of tryptophan (Trp) enantiomers. The prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@PNCD are composed of a Fe3O4 nanoparticle core, an acidic-resistant SiO2 middle shell and a thermosensitive microgel functional shell (PNCD). The PNCD plays an important role in the enantioselective adsorption of Trp enantiomers. The beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) molecules on the PNCD act as smart receptors or chiral selectors, and can selectively recognize and bind L-Trp enantiomers into their cavities by forming host-guest inclusion complexes. The poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chains on the PNCD serve as microenvironmental adjustors for the association constants of beta-CD/L-Trp complexes. The fabricated Fe3O4@SiO2@PNCD demonstrate fascinating temperature-responsive chiral recognition and adsorption selectivity toward Trp enantiomers. Most importantly, the desorption of Trp enantiomers and the regeneration of the Fe3O4@SiO2@PNCD can be easily achieved via simply changing the operation temperature. Moreover, the regenerated Fe3O4@SiO2@PNCD can be readily recovered from the amino acids enantiomeric solution under an external magnetic field for reuse. The present study provides a novel strategy for the direct enantioselective adsorption and separation of various enantiomeric compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unconventional emergency decision making not only involves intangible and conflicting criteria, but also needs a fast response to the emergency incident under the cases of time pressure and incomplete information. It might be an effective way to make full use of the outlier data of incident information and skip some direct comparisons between alternatives to make a fast emergency decision. Focusing on the missing judgments estimation issue in an incomplete comparison emergency decision matrix, this paper extends the geometric mean induced bias matrix to estimate the missing judgments and improve the consistency ratios at the same time. The least absolute error method and the least square method are used to optimize the revised geometric mean induced bias matrix and find the missing values. A numerical example with incomplete information is used to demonstrate the proposed models. A case of emergency decision making simulation is also conducted to show how the proposed model is applied in practice. The results show the proposed models are not only capable of completing missing values, but also can efficiently improve the matrix consistency at the same time. In addition, the proposed model can aid emergency managers to make a fast response to unconventional emergency in the case of lacking complete information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are oxygen-dependent transcriptional activators, which play crucial roles in tumor angiogenesis and mammalian development, and regulate the transcription of genes involved in oxygen homeostasis in response to hypoxia. However, information on HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in yak (Bos grunniens) is scarce. The complete coding region of yak HIF-2 alpha was cloned, its mRNA expression in several tissues were determined, and the expression levels were compared with those of closely related low-altitude cattle (Bos taurus), and the methylation status of promoter regions were analyzed to better understand the roles of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in domesticated yak. The yak HIF-2 alpha cDNA was cloned and sequenced in the present work reveals the evolutionary conservation through multiple sequence alignment, although 15 bases changed, resulting in 8 amino acid substitutions in the translated proteins in cattle. The tissue-specific expression results showed that HIF-1 alpha is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HIF-2 alpha expression is limited to endothelial tissues (kidney, heart, lung, spleen, and liver) and blood in yak. Both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha expressions were higher in yak tissues than in cattle. The HIF-1 alpha expression level is much higher in yak than cattle in these organs, except for the lung (P< 0.05), but the HIF-2 alpha gene is significantly different in the heart, spleen, and kidney (P< 0.05). Furthermore, the methylation levels in the 5' flanking regulatory regions of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha in yak kidney were significantly decreased than cattle counterparts (P< 0.05). Identifying these genes and the comparison of different expressions facilitates the understanding of the biological high-altitude hypoxic stress response mechanism and may assist current medical research to understand hypoxia-related diseases.

AB Ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest carbon flux between the atmosphere and biosphere and is strongly influenced by soil moisture. However, the response and acclimation of GPP to soil moisture remain poorly understood, leading to large uncertainties in characterizing the impact of soil moisture on GPP in Earth system models. Here we analyze the GPP-soil moisture response curves at 143 sites from the global FLUXNET. We find that GPP at 108 sites exhibits hump-shaped response curves with increasing soil moisture, and an apparent optimum soil moisture (SMoptGPP\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${{\rm{SM}}}<^>{{\rm{GPP}}}_{{\rm{opt}}}$$\end{document}, at which GPP reaches the maximum) exists widely with large variability among sites and biomes around the globe.

This novel construct integrated an aldehyde and methacrylic anhydride-modified hyaluronic acid hydrogel (AHAMA) and chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) encapsulating zinc-based polymetallic oxonate nanozyme (Zn-POM) and glucose oxidase (GOx), facilitating a sustained release of release of both enzymes. The GOx catalyzed glucose to gluconic acid and (H2O2), thereby alleviating the effects of the hyperglycemic microenvironment on wound healing. Zn-POM exhibited catalase and superoxide dismutase activities to scavenge reactive oxygen species and H2O2, a by-product of glucose degradation. Additionally, Zn-POM induced M1 macrophage reprogramming to the M2 phenotype by inhibiting the MAPK/IL-17 signaling diminishing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, thus remodeling the immune microenvironment and enhancing angiogenesis and collagen regeneration within wounds. In a rat diabetic wound model, the application of AHAMA/CS-GOx@Zn-POM enhanced neovascularization and collagen deposition, accelerating the wound healing process.
   Conclusions Therefore, the regenerative microenvironment regulator AHAMA/CS-GOx@Zn-POM can achieve the effective conversion of a pathological microenvironment to regenerative microenvironment through integrated control of the hyperglycemic-immune microenvironment, offering a novel strategy for the treatment of diabetic wounds.

AB A microneedle transdermal drug delivery system simultaneously avoids systemic toxicity of oral administration and low efficiency of traditional transdermal administration, which is of great significance for acne vulgaris therapy. Herein, eugenol-loaded hyaluronic acid-based dissolving microneedles (E@P-EO-HA MNs) with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities are developed for acne vulgaris therapy via eugenol transdermal delivery integrated with photothermal therapy. E@P-EO-HA MNs are pyramid-shaped with a sharp tip and a hollow cavity structure, which possess sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin and achieve transdermal delivery, in addition to excellent in vivo biocompatibility. Significantly, E@P-EO-HA MNs show effective photothermal therapy to destroy sebaceous glands and achieve antibacterial activity against deep-seated Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) under near-infrared-light irradiation. Moreover, cavity-loaded eugenol is released from rapidly dissolved microneedle bodies to play a sustained antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapy on the P. acnes infectious wound. E@P-EO-HA MNs based on a synergistic therapeutic strategy combining photothermal therapy and eugenol transdermal administration can significantly alleviate inflammatory response and ultimately facilitate the repair of acne vulgaris. Overall, E@P-EO-HA MNs are expected to be clinically applied as a functional minimally invasive transdermal delivery strategy for superficial skin diseases therapy in skin tissue engineering.

AB During feeding process in intensive chicken farms, the prolonged exposure of chickens to elevated level of ammonia leads to substantial economic losses within poultry farming industry. Luteolin (Lut), known as its antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, possesses the ability to eliminate free radicals and enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes, thus rendering it highly esteemed in production. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of Lut on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses of chicken splenic lymphocytes exposed to ammonia. In order to achieve this, we have replicated a protective model involving Lut against ammonia exposure in chicken splenic lymphocytes. The findings of the study indicated that Lut mitigated the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by ammonia poisoning. Additionally, Lut demonstrated an increase in the expression of antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Furthermore, Lut exhibited a protective effect on cell morphology and ultrastructure following exposure to ammonia. Moreover, Lut exhibited a reduction in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and inflammatory cytokines, which were found to be highly expressed in splenic lymphocytes after ammonia exposure. Additionally, Lut demonstrated the ability to inhibit the overexpression of pyroptosis-related genes and proteins (NLRP3 and Caspase-1) in splenic lymphocytes following ammonia exposure. Lut exerted an antioxidant effect on lymphocytes, counteracting elevated levels of oxidative stress following exposure to ammonia. Additionally, Lut had the potential to modulate the expression of HSPs, suppressed the inflammatory response subsequent to ammonia exposure, and influenced the expression of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, thereby mitigating pyroptosis induced by ammonia exposure. The exploration of this subject matter can elucidate the protective properties of Lut against NH4Cl-induced 4 Cl-induced damage in chicken splenic lymphocytes, while also offer insights and experimental groundwork for the utilization of natural therapeutics in animal husbandry to prevent and treat ammonia-related conditions.

AB Skin cancer diagnosis often relies on image segmentation as a crucial aid, and a high-performance segmentation can lower misdiagnosis risks. Part of the medical devices often have limited computing power for deploying image segmentation algorithms. However, existing high-performance algorithms for image segmentation primarily rely on computationally intensive large models, making it challenging to meet the lightweight deployment requirement of medical devices. State-of-the-art lightweight models are not able to capture both local and global feature information of lesion edges due to their model structures, result in pixel loss of lesion edge. To tackle this problem, we propose LeaNet, a novel U-shaped network for high-performance yet lightweight skin cancer image segmentation. Specifically, LeaNet employs multiple attention blocks in a lightweight symmetric Ushaped design. Each blocks contains a dilated efficient channel attention (DECA) module for global and local contour information and an inverted external attention (IEA) module to improve information correlation between data samples. Additionally, LeaNet uses an attention bridge (AB) module to connect the left and right sides of the U-shaped architecture, thereby enhancing the model's multi-level feature extraction capability. We tested our model on ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 datasets. Compared with large models like ResUNet, LeaNet improved the ACC, SEN, and SPEC metrics by 1.09 %, 2.58 %, and 1.6 %, respectively, while reducing the model's parameter number and computational complexity by 570x and 1182x. Compared with lightweight models like MALUNet, LeaNet achieved improvements of 2.07 %, 4.26 %, and 3.11 % in ACC, SEN, and SPEC, respectively, reducing the parameter number and computational complexity by 1.54x and 1.04x.

AB Multispectral radiation thermometry is one of the most effective methods to obtain object true temperature and emissivity information in radiation thermometry. How to improve the measurement accuracy of multispectral radiation thermometry has always been driving the focus of the scientific community. This paper provides a comprehensive review of data processing algorithms in multispectral radiation thermometry, including the conventional emissivity assumption model method and the improved method which are exhibited from the as-pects of temperature measurement accuracy, data processing time, and modeling form. This paper aims to describe and clarify the principles, accuracy, features, and application scenarios of the above data processing algorithms. Some algorithmic developments and recent advances are presented, which are based on the emissivity assumption model, neural networks, and constrained optimization theory. Relative ad-vantages and limitations are outlined by comparing relevant studies of data processing algorithms in the literature. The review will help researchers to determine the algorithm suiting objects according to the temperature measurement range and application scenarios to improve the accuracy of multispectral radiation thermometry. Knowledge of the above data processing algorithms will also help researchers develop novel methods to promote the development of multispectral radiation thermometry.

AB Polyphenols, commonly found in various plants, have attracted enormous attention due to their potential pharmacological activity, especially antitumor activity dependent on immune function. In recent years, the development of nanomedicine can counteract the low bioavailability of polyphenols and improve the effect of tumor treatment. Among them, metal-phenolic networks (MPNs), which utilize various metal ions and phenolic ligands for coordination binding, have now become candidates for polyphenol-based nanomedicine treatment of tumors. In this mini-review, we described the classification of polyphenols and their mechanisms in antitumor immune responses, and provided suggestions for the next steps of treating tumors with polyphenols.

AB The quantification of the allocation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) among plant organs is essential to improve our understanding of plant growth, life-history strategies and ecosystem nutrient and energy cycles. However, allocation strategies of N and P between terrestrial plant leaves and fine roots are unclear. Here, we compiled a global dataset comprising 807 terrestrial plant species to analyse the stoichiometric scaling of N and P between leaves and fine roots across species, families, plant groups, biomes and locations. We found that N and P, and N:P ratios manifest different scaling exponents (alpha-values) between leaves and fine roots. Specifically, overall alpha(N) and alpha(P) were >1 and <1, respectively, and alpha(N:P) = 1, indicating a higher proportional increase of N to fine roots and P to leaves. However, there were differences in alpha(N), alpha(P) and alpha(N:P) among major species, families, plant groups, biomes and locations. In addition, alpha(N) and alpha(N:P) increased with latitude; there was no clear trend for alpha(P). Mean annual temperature accounted for the greatest proportion of variation in alpha(N), whereas soil total P accounted for the greatest proportion of variation in alpha(P) and alpha(N:P). Synthesis. Our results demonstrate a divergent N and P allocation strategy between leaves and fine roots in terrestrial plants. This study improves our understanding of the effects of the environment (including changes in global climate and life-history strategies) on nutrient allocation patterns between these two important plant organs.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) has been widely used in the modification of membranes due to its excellent properties, i.e., huge specific surface area, good electrical conductivity, good hydrophilicity and various functional groups. The addition of GO in membranes were proved to exhibit improved properties in water permeability, molecular selectivity, membrane fouling mitigation and contaminants decomposition. Recently, the development of laminated GO in membranes achieved both high selectivity and high water permeability, conquering the limitations of conventional polymeric or inorganic membranes. By analyzing the separation mechanisms and the performance of GO composite membranes, this review systematically summarized the applications of GO composite membranes in three highlighted areas of environmental fields: desalination, gas separation and wastewater treatment, with challenges discussed faced with GO composite membranes.

AB In this study, vanadium trioxide (V2O3) was adopted to activate PMS via a Fenton-like reaction to degrade metronidazole (MNZ). The V2O3-PMS system can almost completely degrade MNZ at 30 min with 42.4% TOC removal. Comparative tests reveal that V2O3 stands out among a variety of heterogeneous catalysts, including metallic oxides and carbon materials. Sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot-) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) derived from PMS decomposition are major reactive oxygen species, based on quenching tests, electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis, the steady-state concentrations of radicals ([SO4 center dot-](ss) = 5.1 x 10(-13) M and [(OH)-O-center dot](ss) = 4.0 x 10(-14) M), and kinetics model. The process of stepwise electron transfer from vanadium species to PMS to produce reactive radicals was proved by small-molecule simulation experiments and pickling experiments of vanadium oxides. Possible pathways of MNZ degradation were proposed based on the results of LC-MS and Fukui function, including two stages of the hydroxylation and bond cleavage of nitro and the subsequent ring-opening. This study reveals the high reusability and practicability of the V2O3-PMS system over a relatively wide pH range, which puts forward a new vision on V2O3 induced Fenton-like reactions and a new reference method for the removal of medical organic contaminants in water.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, the security of IoT becomes more and more prominent. To protect data privacy and device availability, identity authentication technology has been applied to the IoT environment. However, although scholars have designed a variety of authentication protocols for the IoT environment, the resource costs of these protocols are still expensive for resource-constrained devices. In particular, when the frequent upgrade of computer hardware has led to a gradual increase in the key length of the cryptosystem, IoT devices are hard to keep up with the upgrade speed because of the balance between cost and tasks. Although the storage space has increased in recent years, the computational and communication capabilities are still limited by some physical factors, such as energy, power, and communication link bandwidth. To improve the situation, this article proposes an anonymous authentication protocol suitable for IoT devices with current hardware performance, which is based on elliptic curve and signcryption techniques. Compared to other protocols, our protocol further reduces the communication and computing cost of the client devices while ensuring security requirements. Thus, we formally prove its theoretical security under the random oracle model and use simulation experiments to verify that the protocol can effectively reduce the resource requirements.

AB Agricultural activities have a significant impact on environmental quality, because they generate waste that pollutes water and soil. In parallel, the supply of products has diversified in recent years to meet growing demand, exerting strong pressure on nature's capacity for regeneration and absorption of waste. This research aims to examine the impact of agricultural employment and the export diversification index on ecological footprints, using advanced techniques of panel data econometrics. This relationship is moderated by population density and real per capita product. Cross-section dependence and slope homogeneity were included in the econometric models. The cointegration and causality analysis was reinforced by estimating the short- and long-term elasticities, using the AMG, CCE-MG, FMOLS, and DOLS models. Using annual data for 96 countries, we found a heterogeneous impact of agricultural employment and the export diversification index on ecological footprint, between the short and long term. The findings reveal that the increase of the product increases the pressure on the ecological footprint. The achievement of SDGs must include joint efforts between countries, and not in isolation. Those responsible for environmental policy should promote the idea that production must be friendly to the environment and promote the green growth of countries. The adoption of new technology, higher productivity agricultural employment, and the regulation of exports of sustainable products can contribute to achieving environmental sustainability.

AB As an extensively environmental pollution, Nickel (Ni) represents a serious hazard to human health. The present study focused on exploring the mechanism of Ni-mediated nephrotoxicity, such as apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress. In the current work, NiCl2 treatment could induce kidney damage. Meanwhile, NiCl2 treatment elevated ROS production and MDA content and suppressed the antioxidant activity, which was characterized by reducing T-AOC, CAT, SOD activity and GSH content. For investigating the role of oxidative stress on NiCl2mediated nephrotoxicity, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger) was cotreated with NiCl2. The results showed that NAC significantly suppressed the NiCl2-mediated oxidative stress and mitigated NiCl2-induced the kidney damage. Then, whether oxidative stress-induced autophagy and apoptosis were involved in NiCl2-induced nephrotoxicity was explored. The findings demonstrated that NAC relieved NiCl2-induced autophagy and reversed the activation of Akt/AMPK/mTOR pathway. Concurrently, the results indicated that NAC attenuated NiCl2-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by reduction of apoptotic cells and cleaved-caspase-3/- 8/- 9 together with cleaved-PARP protein levels. To sum up, our findings suggested that NiCl2-mediated renal injury was associated with oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and autophagy. This study provides new theoretical basis for excess Ni exposure nephrotoxic researches.

AB Obesity is increasing rapidly worldwide and is accompanied by many complications, including impaired muscle regeneration. Obesity is known to inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which impedes mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration. Resveratrol has an effective anti-obesity effect, but its effect on regeneration of muscle in obese mice remains to be tested. We hypothesized that resveratrol activates AMPK and mitochondrial biogenesis to improve muscle regeneration. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet or a 60% high-fat diet with or without resveratrol supplementation for 8 weeks and, then, the tibialis anterior muscle was subjected to cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury. Muscle tissue was collected at 3 and 7 d after injury. We found that resveratrol enhanced both proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells following injury in obese mice. Markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were upregulated in resveratrol-treated mice. In C2C12 myogenic cells, resveratrol activated AMPK and stimulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, which were associated with enhanced myogenic differentiation. Such effects of resveratrol were abolished by AMPK alpha 1 ablation, showing the mediatory roles of AMPK. In summary, dietary resveratrol activates AMPK/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha axis to facilitate mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle regeneration impaired due to obesity.

AB Malignant tumors remain the health problem of highest concern among people worldwide due to its high mortality and recurrence. Lung, gastric, liver, colon, and breast cancers are among the top five malignant tumors in terms of morbidity and mortality. In cancer biology, aberrant signaling pathway regulation is a prevalent theme that drives the generation, metastasis, invasion, and other processes of all malignant tumors. The Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Notch and NF-kB pathways are widely concerned and signal crosstalks exist in the five solid tumors. This review provides an innovative summary of the recent progress in research on these signaling pathways, the underlying mechanism of the molecules involved in these pathways, and the important role of some miRNAs in tumor-related signaling pathways. It also presents a brief review of the antitumor molecular drugs that target these signaling pathways. This review may provide a theoretical basis for the study of the molecular biological mechanism of malignant tumors and vital information for the development of new treatment strategies with a focus on efficacy and the reduction of side effects.

TI Coupling adsorption and in-situ Fenton-like oxidation by waste

AB The gap of pollutant concentration between simulated sewage (mg/L level) and actual water (mu g/L level) strongly limits the application of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in natural waters. By coupling adsorption for gathering trace organic contaminants and in-situ catalytic oxidation for recovering adsorption capability, adsorptive catalysts can build a bridge between theoretical research and practical application to promote scientific progress of AOPs. Here, waste leather derived biochar based adsorptive catalysts (WLBC) can effectively adsorb trace sulfamethoxazole (SMX) via electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, pi-pi interaction, and Van der Waals forces, moreover, the subsequent in-situ oxidation of surface SMX by hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) generated from WLBC mediated Fenton-like reaction will recover the adsorption capability of WLBC. Compared with persulfate-driven AOPs, center dot OH-dominated oxidation is nonselective for various pollutants and effective for adsorbent regeneration. In addition, the pathway of SMX degradation was proposed based on the results of liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometer (LC-QTOF-MS), involving four stages of 1) nitration, hydroxylation, and hydrolytic reaction of SMX, 2) cleavage of S-N and S-C bonds, 3) ring-opening, 4) mineralization. The adsorption and in-situ Fenton-like oxidation system established by WLBC is capable of efficiently degrading trace pollutants and regenerating adsorbent for long-scale operation, which immunes largely from coexisting substances (e.g. anions, cations, and humic acid) with extremely low metal leaching and relatively low cost. Therefore, this study proposes a strategy for sustainable removal of trace organic pollutant in natural waters based on coupling WLBC induced adsorption and in-situ Fenton-like oxidation.

AB As temperatures rise and water availability decreases, the water decit is gaining attention regarding future agricultural production. Drought stress is a global issue and adversely affects the productivity of different crops. In this study, drought-tolerant varieties of oats were screened to determine drought-tolerant varieties that may be employed in drought-prone areas to achieve sustainable development and mitigate the impact of climate change. To do so, the growth and stress adaptive mechanism of 15 domestic and overseas oat cultivars at the seedling stage were analyzed. Water stress was simulated using 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000). The results showed that the soluble protein content and superoxide dismutase activity of variety DY2 significantly increased under drought stress, whereas the photochemical efficiency and relative water content decreased slightly. The relative electrical conductivity (REC) and drought damage index of the QH444 and DY2 varieties increased the least. The peroxidase content of Q1 and DY2 significantly increased, and the catalase activity of Q1, QH444, and DY2 also substantially increased. Principal component analysis revealed that nine physiological and biochemical parameters were transformed into three independent comprehensive indexes. The comprehensive evaluation results showed that DY2, LN, and Q1 exhibited a strong drought resistance capacity and could be used as a reference material for a drought-resistant oat breeding program. The gray correlation analysis also indicated that Fv/Fm, chlorophyll, REC, and malondialdehyde could be used as key indexes for evaluating the drought resistance of oat.

AB Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for CO2 separation have overcome the trade-off between gas permeability and gas selectivity to some extent. However, most MMMs still are prepared in lab- and pilot-scales since the permeability and selectivity of CO2 are not good enough to reach the economically available requirements. Moreover, the fabrication of few MMMs with good separation performance is time-consuming or need harsh conditions. In this study, a novel MOF-based composite membrane (PAN-gamma-CD-MOF-PU membrane) was successfully fabricated by a facile and fast spin-coating method. In the two-step coating process, we applied a uniform selective layer of gamma-cyclodextrin-MOF (gamma-CD-MOF) on porous polyacrylonitrile and then coated a layer of polyurethane on the gamma-CD-MOF layer. The entire membrane formation process was about 30 s. The formation of a unique gamma-CD-MOF layer greatly improved the separation ability of CO2 (the CO2 permeability is 70.97 barrers; the selectivity to CO2/N-2 and CO2/O-2 are 253.46 and 154.28, respectively). The gas separation performance can exceed the Robeson upper limit obviously and the selectivity is better than other MOF-based composite membranes. In addition, the PAN-gamma-CD-MOF-PU membrane is strong and flexible. Therefore, the PAN-gamma-CD-MOF-PU membrane developed in this study has great potential in large-scale industrial separation of CO2.

AB Radiation treatments often unfavorably damage neighboring healthy organs and cause a series of radiation sequelae, such as radiation-induced hematopoietic system diseases, radiation-induced gastrointestinal diseases, radiation-induced lung diseases, and radiation-induced skin diseases. Recently, emerging nanomaterials have exhibited good superiority for these radiation-induced disease treatments. Given this background, the rational design principle of nanomaterials, which helps to optimize the therapeutic efficiency, has been an increasing need. Consequently, it is of great significance to perform a systematic summarization of the advances in this field, which can trigger the development of new high-performance nanoradioprotectors with drug efficiency maximization. Herein, this review highlights the advances and perspectives in the rational design of nanomaterials for preventing and treating various common radiation-induced diseases. Furthermore, the sources, clinical symptoms, and pathogenesis/injury mechanisms of these radiation-induced diseases will also be introduced. Furthermore, current challenges and directions for future efforts in this field are also discussed.

AB As a common mental health problem, social anxiety refers to the fear and avoidance of interacting in social or performance situations, which plays a crucial role in many health and social problems. Although a growing body of studies has explored the neuroanatomical alterations related to social anxiety in clinical patients, far fewer have examined the association between social anxiety and brain morphology in the general population, which may help us understand the neural underpinnings of social anxiety more comprehensively. Here, utilizing a voxel-based morphometry approach via structural magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain gray matter correlates of social anxiety in 231 recent graduates of the same high school grade. We found that social anxiety was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), which is a core brain area for cognitive processing of emotions and feelings. Critically, emotional intelligence mediated the impact of right MTG volume on social anxiety. Notably, our results persisted even when controlling for the effects of general anxiety and depression. Altogether, our research reveals right MTG gray matter volume as a neurostructural correlate of social anxiety in a general sample of adolescents and suggests a potential indirect effect of emotional intelligence on the association between gray matter volume and social anxiety.

AB Gemini surfactant/GO composites (10-2-10/GO, 12-2-12/GO, and 14-2-14/GO) have been successfully prepared using three gemini surfactants with different tail chain lengths. The morphology and physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The gemini surfactant/GO composites were applied to the adsorption of Congo red dye, and from the experimental data, optimum adsorption conditions, adsorption kinetics, and isotherms were obtained. The removal process was favorable at acidic pH and reached equilibrium in similar to 60 min. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm were a good fit for the adsorption of Congo red onto gemini surfactant/GO composites. Compared with other adsorbents reported in the literature, these composites showed superior Congo red adsorption capabilities, with absorption capacities as high as 2116, 2193, and 2325 mg g(-1) for 10-2-10/GO, 12-2-12/GO, and 14-2-14/GO, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption capacities were more than 1000 mg g(-1) even for the fifth cycle. The results of the present study substantiate that the gemini surfactant/GO composites are promising adsorbents for the removal of organic dyes in wastewater treatment.

AB Specific frontolimbic abnormalities are hypothesized to underlie the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, findings from neuroimaging studies were inconsistent. In the current study, we aimed to provide a complete overview of cerebral microstructural alterations in gray matter (GM) of BPD patients. A total of 11 studies were enrolled, comprising 275 BPD patients and 290 healthy controls (HCs). A meta-analysis was conduct to quantitatively estimate regional GM abnormalities in BPD patients using the seed-based d mapping (SDM). Meta-regression was also conducted. Compared with HCs, the BPD patients exhibited increased GM mainly in bilateral supplementary motor area extending to right posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and bilateral primary motor cortex, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and the bilateral precuneus extending to bilateral PCC. Decreased GM was identified in bilateral middle temporal gyri, right inferior frontal gyrus extending to right insular, left hippocampus and left superior frontal gyrus extending to left medial orbitofrontal cortex. The mean age of BPD patients were found nagativly associated with GM alterations in right MFG. Our findings suggested that BPD patients have significantly GM abnormalities in the default mode network and frontolimbic circuit. Our results provided further evidences in elucidating the underline neural mechanisms of BPD.

AB The Paeonia genus, an important source of crude drugs, has been extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat cardiovascular and female-related diseases. Although many peony species have been investigated, the study of Paeonia rockii is still quite limited, especially its chemical composition. Here, an advanced ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analytical technique combined with Q-Exactive Orbitrap hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry utilizing high-resolution full MS and MS/MS scan modes was applied to screen and identify the chemical constituents of this species. As a result, a total of 46 compounds were characterized, including 11 monoterpene glycosides, five phenolic acids, six tannins and 24 flavonoids. Among them, 16 compounds were reported for the first time in Paeonia rockii.

AB Biodegradable multi-blocked polyurethane (PU) based micelles with a hydrophilic PEG corona were extensively studied for anti-cancer drug delivery systems. The hydrophilic PEG segment usually incorporated as a soft segment or as an end capping reagent, which has difficulty forming a dense PEG coating with a brush like conformation due to the low mobility of the PEG domains at the soft segment and the low amount of the PEG at the end of PU chains. In the present study, biodegradable pH sensitive polyurethane micelles with a dense brush like coating of PEG were prepared by a new kind of PEG grafted polyurethanes (PEG-g-PU) which were synthesized using PEGylated diethanolamine (MPEG-DEAM) as a chain extender. The high mobility of pendant MPEG in PEG-g-PU results in the formation of a dense and brush like PEG corona on the PEG-g-PU micelles. Meanwhile the MPEG attached on the hard segment will transfer the diethanolamine (DEAM) to the surface of nanoparticles during the self-assembly process and the DEAM render the particles with positive charges which potentially enhances cellular uptake and endosomal escape. DLS, TEM and AFM showed that a dense PEG domain was formed on the surface of PEG-g-PU micelles while no obvious PEG microdomain was observed for the other two kinds of micelles. FTIR and DSC results demonstrated the enhanced microphase separation of PEG-g-PU micelles compared with PEG-g-PU bulk materials and the other two contrast PU micelles, i.e. PEG-b-PU and PEG-c-PU. Paclitaxel (PTX) was chosen as a model hydrophobic drug to evaluate the loading and pH-triggered release of the PU micelles. The enhanced cytotoxicity of PTX-loaded PEG-g-PU-3 micelles against H460 cancer cells reveals that they are more potent for intracellular delivery of PTX as compared to PEG-b-PU-3 and PEG-c-PU-3 micelles.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using the non-official species Scutellaria indica L as the substitute for the official species Scutellaria barbata D. Don. A sensitive, precise and accurate method was developed to identify their chemical compositions from the crude extracts using UHPLC-PDA-QTOF-MS/MS. 36 peaks were detected and 28 peaks have been tentatively and structurally characterized by comparing their retention times, UV spectra and HR-MS data with those of the reference substances and/or the data of the literatures. Additionally, 5 flavonoids have been quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in the negative ionization mode. The results demonstrated that there were 23 common peaks between these two species. However, the other 13 peaks from S. barbata could not be detected in S. indica. Furthermore, the content of 5 flavonoids is significantly different. Scutellarein cannot be detected in S. indica, which was considered as the characteristic component for distinguishing the two species. Our data, therefore, clearly demonstrate that S. indica may not be used as the substitute for S. barbata and further investigation is needed to determine through investigation of their therapeutic efficacy.

AB Selectively harnessing photo-induced carriers to control surface photo-redox reactions can enable currently limited specificity in photocatalytic applications. By using a new approach to switching between dominant electron and hole charge transfer on the surfaces of metal oxide nanocrystals, depending on the optimal carrier for specific application functionality in photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H2 production, CO2 reduction, and gas sensing. The approach is based on the surface redox properties of custom-designed p-n hetero-structured hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) containing copper oxide, and wide-gap metal oxide semiconductors (MOSs). The customized CuxO/ZnO (CXZ) heterostructures ensure effective charge separation and surface reactions driven by UV-vis excited highly reactive holes and show high performance in the photo-oxidative degradation of organic dyes and NO2 gas sensing.

AB The discussion surrounding natural resources and government effectiveness in mitigating carbon emissions has garnered significant attention. However, the existing evidence on this matter remains limited. This research delves into this issue within the BRICS nations, shedding light on pivotal factors influencing the ecological landscape. Spanning the years 1995-2021, this study identifies government effectiveness, green innovation, natural resources, and economic growth as crucial determinants that significantly shape the environmental sustainability of BRICS nations. For this purpose, we employ the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR), Canay (2011) quantile regression, and AMG. Study results reveal a positive correlation between nuclear energy and CO2 emissions, signaling environmental challenges. Conversely, government effectiveness consistently correlates with reduced CO2 emissions, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 16. The positive relationship between green technology innovation and natural resource utilization with CO2 emissions underscores the imperative for environmental considerations. On the flip side, economic growth negatively impacts CO2 emissions, suggesting potential avenues for sustainable development. These findings highlight the urgency of targeted policies, especially resource-related ones, to enhance environmental sustainability in BRICS nations. Recognizing their global impact, strategic interventions are crucial for addressing environmental challenges and fostering sustainable development.

AB The anodic electrooxidation of ethanol to value-added acetate is an excellent example of replacing the oxygen evolution reaction to promote the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and save energy. Herein, we present a colloidal strategy to produce Ni-Fe bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as efficient electrocatalysts for the electrooxidation of ethanol in alkaline media. Ni-Fe alloy NPs deliver a current density of 100 mA center dot cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH solution containing 1.0 M ethanol merely at 1.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), well above the performance of other electrocatalysts in a similar system. Within continuous 10 h testing at this external potential, this electrode is able to produce an average of 0.49 mmol center dot cm(-2 center dot)h(-1) of acetate with an ethanol-to-acetate Faradaic efficiency of 80%. A series of spectroscopy techniques are used to probe the electrocatalytic process and analyze the electrolyte. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the iron in the alloy NPs significantly enhances the electroconductivity and electron transfer, shifts the rate-limiting step, and lowers the energy barrier during the ethanol-to-acetate reaction pathway.

AB Barium titanate [ BaTiO 3 (BT)]-based ceramics are typical ferroelectric materials. Here, the discontinuous grain growth (DGG) and relevant grain size effect are deeply studied. An obvious DGG phenomenon is observed in a paradigmatic Zr 4 + -doped BT-based ceramic, with grains growing from -2.2-6.6 to -121.8- 198.4 & mu;m discontinuously near 1320 & DEG;C. It is found that fine grains can get together and grow into large ones with liquid phase surrounding them above eutectic temperature. Then the grain boundary density ( D g ) is quantitatively studied and shows a first-order reciprocal relationship with grain size, and the grain size effect is dependent on D g . Fine grains lead to high D g , and then cause fine domains and pseudocubiclike phase structure because of the interrupted long-range ferroelectric orders by grain boundary. High D g also causes the diffusion phase transition and low Curie dielectric peak due to the distribution of phase transition temperature induced by internal stress. Local domain switching experiments reveal that the polarization orientation is more difficult near the grain boundary, implying that the grain boundary inhibition dominates the process of polarization orientation in fine-grain ceramics, which leads to low polarization but a high coercive field. However, large-grain ceramics exhibit easy domain switching and high & similar ferroelectricity. This work reveals that the grain boundary effect dominates the grain size effect in fine-grain ceramics, and expands current knowledge on DGG and grain size effect in polycrystalline materials. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

AB Shrub encroachment can significantly affect the ecosystem structure and functioning of alpine grasslands. However, little is known about how this phenomenon alters soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and soil nitrogen stocks (STNS) in different alpine grassland ecosystems within the same region. Here we addressed this research gap by investigating the SOCS and STNS of encroached and non-encroached plots in alpine meadow and alpine steppe ecosystems on the central Tibetan Plateau. We found that, in both ecosystems, shrub encroachment significantly increased herbaceous plant richness, diversity, and aboveground biomass, but more notably in alpine meadow. Conversely, shrub encroachment increased belowground plant biomass in alpine steppe but had the opposite effect in alpine meadow, where belowground biomass was four times lower at encroached than at non-encroached plots. Importantly, encroaching shrubs resulted in significantly higher SOCS and STNS in both ecosystems, with alpine steppe showing the greatest carbon and nitrogen gains. The shrub encroached plots had 34.24 % and 97.25 % higher carbon stocks and 70.87 % and 67.34 % higher nitrogen stocks than non-encroached plots at the alpine meadow and alpine steppe, respectively. Increases in carbon and nitrogen stocks occurred mostly at the 10-30 cm soil layer and were highly correlated with shrub-induced changes in the herbaceous community composition. Overall, our results indicated that (1) shrub encroachment promoted carbon and ni-trogen accumulation in the soils of both alpine meadow and alpine steppe and (2) the degree of accumulation and the mechanisms behind these changes varied between the two alpine grasslands. Our findings advance the general understanding of the soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in shrub-encroached alpine grasslands and highlight the importance of investigating how this phenomenon affects different ecosystems within the same region.

AB Blueberry anthocyanins (ANCs) are natural dietary bioactive colorants, but are unstable and easily degraded. To improve their stability, we constructed the nanocarriers for ANCs through an electrostatic self-assembly method, using chitosan (CS) and olive pectin (PC). Results showed that the CS-ANCs-PC nanocomplexes had nanoscale particle size (81.22 +/- 0.44 nm), and an encapsulation efficiency of 91.97 +/- 0.33% at pH 3.0, 1:1:5 ratio (m/v) of CS: ANCs: PC. Fourier transform infrared and UV-visible spectra demonstrated that ANCs can be embedded into the CS-PC carrier through electrostatic interaction. CS-ANCs-PC with stacked spherical particle structure had good thermal stability by scanning electron microscope and thermogravimetric analysis. Compared with free anthocyanins, CS-ANCs-PC possessed better DPPH. and .OH scavenging activities, stronger environmental sta-bility, and better targeted release in vitro digestion. This study may provide an important fundamental basis for improving the stability of anthocyanins in the blueberry industry.

AB Facile techniques that are time-and cost-saving nowadays are required for preparing PI aerogels with low density, structural stability, high mechanical performance, and thermal stability in wide practical applications. In this work, a strategy of solvothermal imidization followed by vacuum drying, using electrospun short pol-yimide (PI) fiber as supporting skeleton, was reported to prepare high-performance PI aerogels without the implementations of special drying instruments. The mechanism of "self-gluing" of the fiber-constructed skeleton of PI during preparation process was applied to enhance the strength of the precursor gels and achieve structural stability. PI aerogels with hierarchically cellular structure possessed bimodal interconnected pores, tunable densities (From 39.1 mg cm-3 to 55.8 mg cm-3), and high porosity (>96%) are reported. The aerogels showed low energy-loss coefficients for 103 cyclic compressive tests and initial degradation temperature high than 400 and 500 degrees C in air and nitrogen atmosphere, respectively.

AB Polysialic acid (PSA) is a straight-chain homoglycan linked by N-acetylneuraminic acid monomers via alpha-2, 8-or alpha-2, 9-glycosidic bonds. As a negatively charged non-glycosaminoglycan, PSA has the remarkable characteristics of non-immunogenicity and biodegradation. Although different in class, PSA is similar to poly(ethylene glycol), and was originally used to increase the stability of the delivery system in circulation to prolong the half-life. As research continues, PSA's application potential in the pharmaceutical field becomes increasingly prominent. It can be used as a biomaterial for protein polysialylation and tissue engineering, and it can be used alone or with other materials to develop multifunctional drug delivery systems. In this article, the results of the bioproduction and biofunction of PSA are introduced, the common strategies for chemical modification of PSA are summarized, and the application progress of PSA-based drug delivery systems is reviewed.

AB Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychological health issue among women, which often comorbids with anxiety (PPD-A). PPD and PPD-A showed highly overlapping clinical symptoms. Identifying disorder-specific neurophysiological markers of PDD and PPD-A is important for better clinical diagnosis and treatments. Here, we performed functional connectivity density (FCD) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses in 138 participants (45 unmedicated patients with first-episode PPD, 31 PDD-A patients and 62 healthy postnatal women, respectively). FCD mapping revealed specifically weaker long-range FCD in right lingual gyrus (LG.R) for PPD patients and significantly stronger long-range FCD in left ventral striatum (VS.L) for PPD-A patients. The follow-up rsFC analyses further revealed reduced functional connectivity between dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and VS.L in both PPD and PPD-A. PPD showed specific changes of rsFC between LG.R and dmPFC, right angular gyrus and left precentral gyrus, while PPD-A represented specifically abnormal rsFC between VS.L and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the altered FCD and rsFC were closely associated with depression and anxiety symptoms load. Taken together, our study is the first to identify common and disorder-specific neural circuit disruptions in PPD and PPD-A, which may facilitate more effective diagnosis and treatments.

AB The structure, antioxidant activity and hypoglycemic activity in vitro of a novel homogeneous polysaccharide from Tricholoma matsutake (Tmp) were investigated. Structural features suggested that Tmp was consisted of arabinose (Ara), mannose (Man), glucose (Glc) and galactose (Gal) with a molar ratio of 1.9:13.6:42.7:28.3, respectively, with a molecular weight of 72.14 kDa. The structural chain of Tmp was confirmed to contain -> 2,5)-alpha-L-Arabinofuranose (Araf)-(1 ->, -> 3,5)-alpha-L-Araf-(1 ->, beta-D-Glucopyranose (Glcp)-(1 ->, alpha-D-Mannopyranose (Manp)-(1 ->, alpha-D-Galacopyranose (Galp)-(1 ->, -> 4)-beta-D-Galp-(1 ->, -> 3)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 ->, -> 3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, -> 6)-3-O-Methyl (Me)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 ->, -> 6)-alpha-D-Galp-(1 ->, -> 3,6)-beta-D-Glcp-(1 ->, -> 6)-alpha-D-Manp-(1 -> residues. Furthermore, Tmp possessed strong antioxidant activity and showed the strong inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase and a-amylase activities. Then, a further evaluation found that there was a dramatic improvement in the glucose consumption, glycogen synthesis and the activities of pyruvate kinase and hexokinase when the insulin-resistant-human hepatoma cell line (IR-HepG2) was treated with Tmp. The above results indicated that Tmp had good hypoglycemic activity and also exhibited great potentials in in terms of dealing with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB As a leftover of grease processing, the efficient utilization of erucic acid is still a challenge. An alternative strategy is to develop erucic acid-derived surfactants. However, erucic acid-based ionic liquid surfactants were barely involved. Here, a novel ionic liquid surfactant, benzyltrimethylammonium erucate (ErBTA), was developed by a simple neutralization reaction, and its aggregations in the diluted and concentrated solution were systematically studied by surface tension, conductivity, rheology, and cryo-TEM techniques. The results showed that ErBTA has a very low metaling point (-7.03 degrees C) and possesses excellent water solubility (Krafft temperature <4 degrees C). ErBTA alone starts to form micelles at a very low concentration (0.028 mmol/L) and then to form worm-based viscoelastic fluid at 4.07 mmol/L without any additives, exhibiting excellent self-assembly ability and thickening ability. This viscoelastic fluid formed by ErBTA can simultaneously respond to three stimuli: common acid/alkaline, CO2 gas, and light, accompanied by an interesting gel-sol conversion, reflecting microstructure transition from wormlike micelles to spherical micelles. Although in essence CO2 and light also act as pH regulators in the current system, they provide more sophisticated approaches to tune pH. Such a viscoelastic fluid with the characteristics of easy availability, renewability of raw materials, the simplicity of fabrication, good water-solubility, and excellent thickening ability may be an attractive candidate for clean fracturing in oil/gas recovery and fluid drag reduction.

AB Post phytoremediation accumulation of heavy metals in plants is causing an environmental issue worldwide. In this study, we investigated the ability of eight different kinds of microorganisms to degrade and release heavy metals from heavy metal enriched ryegrass, including 5 species of bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus-I, Bacillus pumilus-II and Bacillus cereus) and 3 of fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma ressei and Pterula sp. strain QD-1), by growing them under uranium stress and assessing their ability to degrade biomass. After 30 days, the degradation ability of fungi was found better than that of bacteria, while the metal leaching ability of bacteria was found better. The highest degradation rate (upto 60%) was obtained by using P. chrysosporium, Pterula sp. strain QD-1 exhibited the best leaching rate for uranium (upto 77%). The overall degradation rate of lignin and cellulose and hemicellulose was found lower (40% and 60%, respectively). According to the antagonistic characteristics of microbes, we combined different dominant species, in which under optimal conditions the T2 combination (P. chrysosporium, T. reesei, and Pterula sp. strain QD-1 and B. subtilis) was able to degrade 80% of the ryegrass, 51% of lignin, 74% of cellulose and hemicellulose, releasing 78% of U, 90% of Pb and the releasing rate of other heavy metals was more than 95%. FTIR analysis showed the least degradation of lignin, while SEM-EDX analysis of the degradation residues displayed the microstructure of ryegrass being greatly damaged. Only a small amount of U was found in the residues of the researched combinations. This study provides efficient Microbial Combined Degradation Technology for heavy metal enriched biomass, which can effectively deal with heavy metal enriched plants, and provide a basis for the recovery and utilization of heavy metals, avoiding secondary pollution in the environment caused by this type of biomass.

AB An efficient triazole Schiff base fluorescent Al3+-probe 4-((2-hydroxybenzylidene) amino)-5-(1H-indol-3-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (H2L) was designed and synthesized under microwave irradiation. The structure of fluorescent probe H2L was characterized by spectral data and elemental analysis. The probe H2L displays excellent chemo-selectivity towards Al3+ over other metal ions, which can directly inspect with the naked eye under UV lamp. The limit of detection of the probe H2L for Al3+ could reach 29.9 nM. The binding stoichiometry between H2L and Al3+ was determined from the Job's plot to be 1:1, the association constant (Ka) of 9.31 x 10(4)M(-1), and further verified with fluorescence titration, ESI-MS and H-1 NMR study.

AB Antibiotic exposure during neonatal development may result in transient or persistent alterations of key microbes that are vital for normal development of local and systemic immunity, potentially impairing immune competence later in life. To further elucidate the relationship between antibiotic exposure and immune development, newborn pigs were exposed to a therapeutic pediatric dose (30 mg/kg/day) of amoxicillin (AB) or placebo (PL) from post-natal day (PND) 0-14. Subsequently, immune cell phenotype, microbial composition, and immune response to an intraperitoneal (IP) challenge with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were evaluated. AB exposure caused significant changes in fecal microbial composition on PND 3 (P = 0.025). This stemmed from a 2-fold increase in Enterobacteriaceae with live cecal coliforms on PND 7 indicating at 10-fold increase (P = 0.036). Alterations in microbial composition were transient, and successional patterns were normalizing by PND 14 (P = 0.693). Differences in PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) immune cell subtypes were detected, with the percentage of CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells among the broader T cell population (CD3(+)CD4(+)/CD3(+)) being significantly higher (P = 0.031) in AB pigs and the numbers of CD4(+)CD45RA(+) (naive) T cells per liter of blood were lower on PND 21 in AB pigs (P = 0.036). Meanwhile, PBMCs from AB pigs produced significantly more IFN gamma upon stimulation with a T-cell mitogen on PND 21 and 49 (P = 0.021). When AB pigs were challenged with heat-killed Salmonella (IP) on PND 49, IFN gamma gene expression in peripheral blood was upregulated compared to those treated with PL (P = 0.043). Additionally, AB pigs showed stronger activation among neutrophils infiltrating the peritoneal cavity after in vivo immune challenge, based on higher levels of NF-kappa B nuclear translocation (P = 0.001). Overall, our results indicate that early life treatment with a therapeutically relevant dose of a commonly prescribed antibiotic has a programming effect on the immune system. Despite antibiotics only causing a transient disruption in gut-associated microbial communities, implications were long-term, with antibiotic treated pigs mounting an upregulated response to an immune challenge. This research adds to the growing body of evidence indicating adverse immune outcomes of early life antibiotic exposures.

AB Peak current mode (PCM) control has been widely used for the control of switching dc-dc converters due to its excellent transient performance. With the development of single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) dc-dc converters, PCM control technique is introduced to the control of SIDO dc-dc converters. Conventional PCM buck converter has only one reference current, with two inductor current borderlines are used to divide the operation modes of inductor current. However, PCM SIDO buck converter has more inductor current borderlines as it has one more reference current than that of PCM buck converter. In this paper, inductor current borderlines of PCM SIDO buck converter are investigated, and unified discrete iterative model of PCM SIDO buck converter is established. The effect of the difference of reference currents, initial inductor current and input voltage on the stability of PCM SIDO buck converter has been discussed by using bifurcation diagrams. The study results show that the stability of PCM SIDO buck converter is sensitive to the difference of reference currents, initial inductor current and input voltage. The stability boundary of the difference of reference currents, stability region of initial inductor current, and stability boundary of input voltage are derived. Lyapunov exponent and experimental results are carried out to verify the theoretical analysis results.

AB The genus Paeonia, also known as the "King of Flowers" in China, is an important source of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Plants of this genus have been used to treat a range of cardiovascular and gynecological diseases. However, the potential pharmacological activity of one particular species, Paeonia rockii, has not been fully investigated. In the first part of the present study, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid (ABTS), reducing power assays, and metal ion chelating assays were used to investigate the in vitro antioxidant activities of Paeonia rockii. In the second portion of the study, amouse model of D-galactose-induced aging was used to validate the antioxidant effects of the flowers from Paeonia rockii in vivo. Lastly, potential antioxidant constituents were screened and identified by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-HRMSn) combined with the DPPH assay. Results indicated that the flowers and leaves exhibited stronger antioxidant activity than ascorbic acid in vitro. The therapeutic effect of Paeonia rockii was determined in relation to the levels of biochemical indicators, such as 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (8-iso PGF(2 alpha)) in the serum, superoxide dismutase (SOD), protein carbonyl, malondialdeh yde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) in the liver and brain, after daily intra-gastric administration of different concentrations of extracts (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) for three weeks. The levels of 8-iso PGF(2 alpha)(p < 0.01) and protein carbonyl groups (p < 0.01) were significantly reduced, whereas those of SOD (p < 0.05) had significantly increased, indicating that components of the flowers of Paeonia rockii had favorable antioxidant activities in vivo. Furthermore, UHPLC-ESI-HRMSn, combined with pre-column DPPH reaction, detected 25 potential antioxidant compounds. Of these, 18 compounds were tentatively identified, including 11 flavonoids, four phenolic acids, two tannins, and one monoterpene glycoside. This study concluded that the leaves and flowers from Paeonia rockii possess excellent antioxidant properties, highlighting their candidacy as "new" antioxidants, which can be utilized therapeutically to protect the body from diseases caused by oxidative stress.

AB Fe2+-H2O2 Fenton system is widely applied in water treatment nowadays, but the acidification and sludge generation are crucial problems to be solved. Herein, we report that Fe3O4/TiO2/C nanocomposites (FTCNCs) were able to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 at neutral pH and can be applied in dye decoloration. FTCNCs were prepared by precipitating TiO2 on Fe3O4 cores via the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate followed by the hydrothermal dehydrogenization of glucose to deposit carbon on Fe3O4/TiO2. The decoloration of methylene blue (MB) in the FTCNC-H2O2 Fenton-like system was monitored to reflect the catalytic activity of FTCNC. The radical generation capability was analyzed by electron spin resonance. Our results indicated that FTCNC-H2O2 Fenton-like system was efficient in decolorizing MB, and the radicals led to the near complete oxidation of MB. The FTCNC-H2O2 Fenton-like system could be used in a wide pH range of 4-9. A greater catalyst amount, a higher H2O2 concentration, and a higher temperature accelerated the decoloration kinetics. FTCNCs showed good activity after the regeneration of 8 cycles. The implication to the practical applications of FTCNCs in water treatment is discussed.

AB Male infertility of cattleyak due to spermatogenic arrest greatly restricts their effective utilization in yak breeding. Although much work has been done to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest, there is no information regarding the differences of protein composition between cattleyak and yak testis. Comparative investigation of testis proteomes between cattleyak and yak using iTRAQ proteomics identified 256 differentially abundant proteins with fold change values higher than +/- 1.5. Most of the differentially abundant proteins were involved in extracellular matrix organization, response to stimulus, metabolic and cellular process, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins were associated with various stresses, cell adhesion and germ cell migration. Such upregulated proteins as integrins and their ligands in the extracellular matrix involved in ECM-receptor interaction pathway may help germ cells to endure pulling forces and impede their migration. In contrast, down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Such Downregulated proteins as the subunits of mitochondrial cytochrome Bc1 complex involved in the Alzheimer's disease and oxidative phosphorylation pathways may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in cattleyak testis.
   Biological significance: Spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak involves defects of both germ cells and their micro environment in testis. In this study, Dozens of proteins possibly associated with spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak were identified by comparative iTRAQ proteomics, in which a large number of the cattleyak predominant proteins may act in response to various stresses (especially inflammatory stresses), enhance cell adhesion and impeded germ cell migration, while down-regulated proteins in cattleyak were associated with defects in various metabolic processes and cellular processes during spermatogenesis. Therefore, germ cells in testis of cattleyak may be constantly in a stress state (similar to inflammation) due to accumulation of some toxic intermediate products resulted from metabolic disturbances. Metabolic defects of germ cells and their deleterious micro environment in testis of cattleyak may be the root of all other problems during spermatogenesis. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Compared with conventional and microwave methods, yields increased to 82-93%, and reaction times decreased to 15-35 min. The structures of these novel compounds were characterized by spectral data and elemental analysis. Two out of the synthesized compounds (10f and 10l) exhibited excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and thus warrant further research. (C) 2015 Academie des sciences.

AB Sediment dredging is a controversial technology for eutrophication control. Its effects on phosphorus (P) cycling are still unclear. In this study, a long term 3 year field investigation was conducted at Dongqian Lake, China, following a sediment dredging project. The amount of iron (Fe) and P forms presented in the sediment from a dredged region (Y region) and a nearby un-dredged region (N region) were monitored and compared. The results showed that soon after the sediment dredging, there were no significant differences in NH4Cl extractable P (NH4Cl-P), NaHCO3/Na2S2O4 extractable P (BD-P) and residual P (Res-P) levels between the Y and N region. However, NaOH extractable reactive P (NaOH-rP) and non-reactive P (NaOH-nrP) were higher, and HCl extractable P (HCl-P) was lower, in the N region than in the Y region. Three years after dredging, considerable reduction in Fe (P < 0.01) was observed in the surface sediment from the N region, contrarily the amount of Fe (P < 0.05) accreted in the newly formed surface sediment from the Y region. Compared with the first year after the sediment dredging, TP increased by 35.2 and 42.3 mg/kg in the sediment of Y and N regions in the third year, respectively. The increased amount of TP in sediments may result from external loadings and existed primarily in two bioavailable forms (BD-P and NaOH-rP) in both the Y region and the N region. This result indicated that it is better to conduct dredging after external P loading has been blocked. In addition, more BD-P and NaOH-rP accumulated in the N region than the Y region. The observed increase in BD-P and NaOH-rP in the N region may result from Fe- and aluminum-adsorbed P from the water column. Our study suggests that Fe cycling in lakes following sediment dredging is an important factor for understanding the environmental effects of sediment dredging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ID MULTIJUNCTION SOLAR-CELLS
AB A hybrid system design integrating a thermoelectric (TE) module has recently represented the advanced photovoltaic (PV) prototype with promoted efficiency for utilizing solar energy from the surroundings. Our present work during development of such a hybrid PV/TE system evaluates the thermal behaviors and the cooling performance associated with when integrating TE and heat sink modules. It has been noticed that a more effective structure through combining a heat sink with a TE module profits heat dissipation by cooling down the whole cell by similar to 8 degrees C, wherein the TE module itself demonstrates the cooling performance by similar to 27% enhancement in addition to its conventional role for electricity generation. Therefore, the PV/TE with a proper design can be used as a passive method for improving the cell efficiency as well as alleviating hot spot, which is typically occurring when the cell is unevenly heated during its operation. These results could be useful for further advancement on stability of power generation of a hybrid PV/TE system and may also be important for developing high-powered light emit diode.

AB Vicarious traumatization (VT), a negative reaction to witnessing others' trauma, has been experienced by some people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and can lead to mental health problems. This study aimed to identify functional brain markers of COVID-specific VT and explore the psychological mechanism underlying the brain-VT link. One hundred healthy participants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before the pandemic (October 2019-January 2020) and completed VT measurement during the pandemic (February-April 2020). Whole-brain correlation analysis based on global functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping revealed that VT was negatively correlated with FCD in the right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) (i.e., the lower FCD in ITG, the worse the VT), identified by mapping onto known large-scale networks as part of the default-mode network (DMN). Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis using ITG as seed found that VT was predicted by lower functional connectivity between ITG and other DMN regions including left medial prefrontal cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule and bilateral precuneus (i.e., the lower the ITG-DMN connectivity, the worse the VT). Mediation analyses suggested that psychological resilience served as a mediator in these associations of ITG FCD and ITG-DMN RSFC with VT. Our results provide novel evidence on the brain basis of VT and emphasize psychological resilience as an important link from DMN functional connectivity to COVID-specific-VT. This may facilitate public health interventions by helping identify individuals at risk of stress- and trauma-related psychopathologies.

AB The authenticity and quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) directly impact clinical efficacy and safety. Quality assessment of traditional Chinese medicine (QATCM) is a global concern due to increased demand and shortage of resources. Recently, modern analytical technologies have been extensively investigated and utilized to analyze the chemical composition of TCM. However, a single analytical technique has some limitations, and judging the quality of TCM only from the characteristics of the components is not enough to reflect the overall view of TCM. Thus, the development of multi-source information fusion technology and machine learning (ML) has further improved QATCM. Data information from different analytical instruments can better understand the connection between herbal samples from multiple aspects. This review focuses on the use of data fusion (DF) and ML in QATCM, including chromatography, spectroscopy, and other electronic sensors. The common data structures and DF strategies are introduced, followed by ML methods, including fast-growing deep learning. Finally, DF strategies combined with ML methods are discussed and illustrated for research on applications such as source identification, species identification, and content prediction in TCM. This review demonstrates the validity and accuracy of QATCM-based DF and ML strategies and provides a reference for developing and applying QATCM methods.

AB According to the increase of energy consumption, wind energy penetration in power generation systems, the wind energy uncertainty and also, due to complex and nonlinear relationships of climatic parameters such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature providing a model to the more accurate forecast of energy production is essential. In this study, an optimal Deep Belief Network (DBN) model has been represented to accurately predict wind energy. The DBN network model is optimized by Modified Coot Optimization Algorithm (MCOA). This procedure uses self-adaptive weighting technique and turbulent technique to prevent trapped local optimization. These two techniques solve the optimization problem, so that it will have a more accurate prediction than the original Coot Optimization Algorithm(COA). The analysis of the modified COA metaheuristic model shows the MCOA model has a minimum of a standard deviation compared to other metaheuristic algorithms. Therefore, the MCOA metaheuristic algorithm has maximum precision and maximum reliability. Also, the simulation of wind energy generation showed, the optimal DBN technique has the best simulation compared to other models. because this model utilizes two techniques self-adaptive weight and chaotic method to refine the weakness optimization process.

AB Although many catalysts have been reported for the CO2 electroreduction to C-1 or C-2 chemicals, the insufficient understanding of fundamental correlations among different products still hinders the development of universal catalyst design strategies. Herein, we first discover that the surface *CO coverage is stable over a wide potential range and reveal a linear correlation between the partial current densities of CH4 and C-2 products in this potential range, also supported by the theoretical kinetic analysis. Based on the mechanism that *CHO is the common intermediate in the formation of both CH4 (*CHO -> CH4) and C-2 (*CHO + *CO , C-2), we then unravel that this linear correlation is universal and the slope can be varied by tuning the surface *H or *CO coverage to promote the selectivity of CH4 or C-2 products, respectively. As proofs-of-concept, using carbon-coated Cu particles, the surface *H coverage can be increased to enhance CH4 production, presenting a high CO2-to-CH4 Faradaic efficiency (FECH4 similar to 52%) and an outstanding CH4 partial current density of -337 mA cm(-2). On the other hand, using an Agdoped Cu catalyst, the CO2RR selectivity is switched to the C-2 pathway, with a substantially promoted FEC2 of 79% and a high partial current density of -421 mA cm(-2). Our discovery of tuning intermediate coverages suggests a powerful catalyst design strategy for different CO2 electroreduction pathways. (C) 2022 Science China Press.

AB Ceramic membranes are widely used in industrial wastewater treatment due to their excellent chemical stability, thermal stability, high oil cut-off rate, and long-term recyclability. However, its application range is limited because of the high price of commercial ceramic membranes. In this study, a low-cost environment-oriented ceramic membrane was prepared from gold mine tailings and SiO2-rich granite waste slag by sintering method. The Fe/S/Si/Al/O enriched ceramic membrane prepared by sintering in an atmospheric atmosphere was beneficial to the application of oil-water separation and heavy metal removal of industrial high concentrated emulsifying wastewater. At lower sintering temperature (1000 celcius), adding 33.3% gold tailings (M3), the membrane had good oil cut-off performance (96.1%) and stability. 29.47 MPa mechanical strength and 2.75% mass loss of 1000-M3 was confirmed under extreme acidic and alkaline conditions, and even in high-temperature environments, the mass loss was only 2.5%. After 16 cycles of performance test, the oil cut-off rate only decreased by 0.01%. The developed membrane exhibited good chemical stability and thermal stability. Based on the analysis of membrane contamination behavior, the ceramic membranes prepared could restore nanoporous channels only by ultrasonic treatment. In addition, 100% removal performance of iron and copper was obtained, and 78.6% removal efficiency was achieved for Chromium and cadmium. These fascinating characteristics make the novel ceramic membrane an excellent candidate with a high oil-water separation ability. More importantly, the inexpensive materials from recyclable solid waste and low-energy consumption preparation technique make it possible to scale up production. Thus, the as-prepared nanoporous ceramic membrane prepared from gold mine tailings with biological toxicity as hazardous waste has the potential of waste resource utilization for treating industrial grade high load emulsion wastewater.

AB Polycrystalline ferroelectric piezoelectric materials are widely used in various functional electronic devices. We present a systematic orientational average method to estimate the piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric polycrystals via first-principle calculations. This method can construct a bridge to connect the monocrystalline and polycrystalline ferroelectric piezoelectric materials, which opens a door to estimate the piezoelectric properties of polycrystals via first-principle calculations, helping the further study of piezoelectric polycrystals. The piezoelectric properties of bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics (BLSFs) polycrystals are investigated via the method, which presents a good agreement in other theoretical and experimental results. It is found that the longitudinal polarization stretching and in-plane polarization rotation contribute the most of piezoelectricity for poled polycrystals. Unexpected polarization stretching of Bi(2)O(2 )layer and slipping between Bi2O2 layer and perovskite block are revealed, being considered to play an important role for the piezoelectricity of BLSFs.

AB The environmental hazards associated with the presence of antibiotics and dyes in water sources require the development of efficient and appropriate wastewater treatment technologies. In the research, a dual catalytic electrode assisted self-sustained Fe2+ electro-Fenton system was constructed to degrade tetracycline, norfloxacin and methyl orange in wastewater efficiently and economically. The novel titanium mesh based PbO2/SnO2 anode electrode was prepared by electrodeposition with the best oxidation performance at the ratio of Sn to Pb 0.5:1, and silver doped Zinc-based organic framework (Ag@ZOF) mixed crystal cathode catalyst was synthesized by precipitation at room temperature. Meanwhile, a sacrificial iron anode was introduced into the system in an acidic solution without a power supply, realizing the endogenous supply of Fe2+. The results indicated that the process was capable of self-supporting H2O2 and Fe2+ under the optimized conditions of pH range of 3.5-4.0, iron area of 10 cm2 and current intensity of 9 mA. The current efficiency was calculated to be as high as 369.5%. The type of conductive substrate supported cathode catalyst is an important factor determining the performance of the novel coupled electric-Fenton system. Electro-Fenton system using Ag@ZOF catalytic electrode loaded with conductive substrates (stainless steel mesh (SS), carbon felt (CF), and activated charcoal granules (ACG)) was constructed to degrade tetracycline (TC), with the degradation efficiencies of 100% (k = 0.03048), 99.7% (k = 0.01831), 99.7% (k = 0.01421). Moreover, the experiment group of Ag@ZOF-SS electrode had achieved good degradation effects for TC, norfloxacin (NOR), methyl orange (MO), and the degradation efficiency was 99.1%, 92.8% and 100%, respectively. The possible degradation pathways of TC, NOR and MO were proposed by analyzing the intermediates. This work demonstrates the scaling-up potential of the system in the treatment of antibiotics and dye wastewater.

AB It is well-known that the ripple control technique benefits from fast load transient response and small cross regulation for single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) dc-dc converter. However, existing capacitor current ripple (CCR) controlled SIDO buck converter suffers from incomplete operation state and single switching path. Thus, it has a limited stable load range. In order to extend the stable load range and suppress cross regulation of SIDO buck converter in continuous conduction mode (CCM), a novel ripple control technique, called as capacitor current and capacitor voltage ripple (CCVR) control, is proposed in this article. The operation principle of the proposed CCVR controlled SIDO CCM buck converter is presented, and its discrete iterative map model is established. Furthermore, the stability and stable load range have been discussed by using bifurcation diagrams. Based on the established small signal model, Bode plots are given to show the performance in suppressing cross regulation. Finally, simulation and experiment results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. It shows that the proposed CCVR control technique can be applied to SIDO CCM buck converter to extend its stable load range and suppress its cross regulation.

AB With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, embedding object detection algorithms into autonomous underwater detectors for marine garbage cleanup has become an emerging application area. Considering the complexity of the marine environment and the low resolution of the images taken by underwater detectors, this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on Mask R-CNN, with the aim of achieving high accuracy marine garbage detection and instance segmentation. First, the idea of dilated convolution is introduced in the Feature Pyramid Network to enhance feature extraction ability for small objects. Secondly, the spatial-channel attention mechanism is used to make features learn adaptively. It can effectively focus attention on detection objects. Third, the re-scoring branch is added to improve the accuracy of instance segmentation by scoring the predicted masks based on the method of Generalized Intersection over Union. Finally, we train the proposed algorithm in this paper on the Transcan dataset, evaluating its effectiveness by various metrics and comparing it with existing algorithms. The experimental results show that compared to the baseline provided by the Transcan dataset, the algorithm in this paper improves the mAP indexes on the two tasks of garbage detection and instance segmentation by 9.6 and 5.0, respectively, which significantly improves the algorithm performance. Thus, it can be better applied in the marine environment and achieve high precision object detection and instance segmentation.

Herein, a new environment-friendly 0.96K(0.4)Na(0.6)Nb(0.97-x)Ta(0.03)Sb(x)O(3)-0.04(Bi0.45Sm0.05)Na0.5ZrO3 (KNNTSx-BSNZ, x = 0 -0.08) ceramic system was designed, which exhibits excellent piezoelectric properties and good temperature stability. A high piezoelectric property of 510 pC/N is obtained by R-T phase engineering in the ceramics with x = 0.045. The temperature stability of electric properties is improved in the temperature range of T = 20-180 degrees C by Ta, Sb co-doping in KNNTSx-BSNZ ceramics with x = 0.02-0.045, benefiting from the combined effects of both the enhanced relaxor behavior and high T-C. Therefore, we believe that it can broaden the application of KNN-based ceramics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A fluorescent-tagged and carboxyl-terminated hyper-branched waterborne polyester (HBP-AP) was prepared and characterized. Acted as CaSO4 scale inhibitor, its application conditions such as the dosage, Ca2+ concentration and pH value, were investigated to optimize the scale inhibition efficiency. In order to provide some theoretical supports for the scale inhibition mechanism of hyper-branched polymers, the scale inhibition mechanism for CaSO4 was then investigated in detailed. The experimental results showed that the HBP-AP provided an excellent scale inhibiting efficiency for CaSO4, which was as high as 98.8 % at dosage of 15 mg/L, and performed well both at high Ca2+ concentration and extended pH value. Besides, the HBP-APTA showed good solubilizing property and dispersion ability. The XRD, SEM and CLSM have been used to character the CaSO4 scale crystal. Especially, with the help of CLSM technology, it is convenient to observe how the prepared hyper-branched inhibitor affected both the CaSO4 crystal nucleation process and crystal growing process, allowing us to understand the scale inhibition mechanism easily for its leading the scale inhibition process visualization.

AB In this paper, a tramway's system model is established to evaluate its longitudinal dynamics performance, where the model includes multiple masses point connecting together powered by the catenary and a hybrid energy-storage system which consists of a battery pack and ultracapacitor pack. To explore an optimal or appropriate real-time power distribution among these energy sources, a dual fuzzy logic control-based energy management strategy combined with wavelet transform and multi-objective optimization is proposed. The control parameters of the dual fuzzy logic controller are adjusted using a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm while considering the daily operating cost of the tramway. To verify the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model and energy management strategy, its simulation results are further compared and verified with the field experimental results of a real tramway and a real driving cycle in China.

AB Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is the causative agent of diarrhoea in newborn calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract illnesses in cattle across the world. In this study, a total of 190 faecal samples from dairy calves with diarrhoea were collected from 14 farms in six Chinese provinces, and BCoV was detected in 18.95% (36/190) of the samples by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Full-length spike, hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), nucleocapsid and transmembrane genes were simultaneously cloned from 13 clinical samples (eight farms in four provinces), and most of the BCoV strains showed a unique evolutionary pattern based on the phylogenetic analysis of these genes. Interesting, 10 of the 13 strains were identified as HE recombinant strains, and these strains had experienced the same recombination event and carried the same recombination sites located between the esterase and lectin domain. They also shared an identical aa variant (F181V) in the R2-loop. Moreover, 9/10 strains displayed another identical aa variant (P, S158A) in the adjacent R1-loop of the HE gene, which differs from the other available BCoV HE sequences in the GenBank database. Our results showed that BCoV is widely circulating in dairy cattle in China, contributing to the diagnosis and control of dairy calves diarrhoea. Furthermore, a BCoV strain that carries a recombinant HE gene has spread in dairy calves in China. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of an HE recombination event occurring in BCoV; this is also the first description of the molecular prevalence of BCoV in China. Our findings will enhance current understanding about the genetic evolution of BCoV.

AB The wide applications of graphene materials require the thorough investigation on their biosafety and environmental risks. Transformation of graphene materials is a fundamental issue in their environmental risk evaluations. The enzymatic degradation of graphene is widely reported using peroxidases, but the information on the fungal transformation of graphene is still unavailable. Herein, we incubated reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium culture system for 4 weeks and investigated the transformation of RGO by multiple techniques. P. chrysosporium efficiently added oxygen to RGO and decreased the its carbon contents accordingly. The I-D/I-G ratios of RGO showed statistically increases upon the transformation by P. chrysosporium according to Raman spectroscopy, suggesting the increase of defects on carbon skeleton. The negatively charged oxygen containing groups exfoliated the graphene sheets as indicated by the larger layer distance according to the X-ray diffraction spectra and the increased roughness under scanning electron microscopy. The transformation was more obvious in the RGO separated from the fungal balls than the precipitates in the culture medium. The mechanism of transformation was attributed to the enzymatic degradation by P. chrysosporium. The environmental implication of the fungal transformation of graphene materials and the potential of using fungi to reduce the environmental risks of graphene materials are discussed.

AB Spatial reciprocity is an effective way widely accepted to facilitate cooperation. In the case of snowdrift game, some researches showed that spatial reciprocity inhibits cooperation for a very wide range of cost-to-benefit ratio r. However, some other researches found that based on the spatial reciprocity, a wider range of r is helpful to achieve a high cooperation level. Thus, how to enlarge the range of r for the purpose of promoting cooperation becomes a hot topic recently. This paper proposes a new memory-based method, in which each individual compares with its own previous payoffs to find out the maximal one as virtual payoff and then randomly compares with one of its neighbours to obtain the optimal strategy according to the given updating rules. It shows the positive effect of spatial reciprocity in the context of memory. Specifically, in this situation, not only the lower ratio can appear a high cooperation level, but also the larger ratio r can emerge a high cooperation level. That is, an expected cooperation level can be achieved simultaneously for small and large r. Furthermore, the scenarios of both constant-size memory and size-varying memory are investigated. An interesting phenomenon is discovered that the cooperation level drops down gradually as the memory size increases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing evidence supports the importance of perseverance for long-term goals in predicting personal success. However, less is known about factors that cause individual differences in perseverance. We tested the role of a specific philosophical belief among laypersons the belief in free will in predicting perseverance among two Chinese adolescent cohorts attending high school. In Study 1 (N = 1262), self-reported belief in free will was associated with stronger perseverance for long-term goals, as measured by the Grit-S scale. In Study 2 (N = 710), we first successfully replicated the association between self-reported belief in free will and perseverance. Then, we categorized the participants into free will believers and determinism believers by a two-alternative forced choice philosophical question regarding the existence of free will. Free will believers scored higher in perseverance than did determinism believers. Taken together, our study implied that the belief in free will is one crucial predictor of perseverance for long-term goals.

AB It is well known that energy plays an important role in sow growth and development. Increasing the utilization of lipids will be beneficial to sows. Emulsifiers are substances which stabilize mixtures and prevent oil and water from separating, thereby enhancing the digestion of lipids. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of dietary emulsifier (lysophospholipids (LPL)) supplementation in diets differing in fat contents on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and milk composition in lactating sows, as well as performance and fecal score in piglets. A total of 32 multiparous sows (LandracexYorkshire) were used in a 21-day experiment. On day 110 of gestation, sows were weighed and moved into the farrowing facility, randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial arrangement according to their BW with two levels of LPL (0 and 30 mg/kg) and two levels of fat (4.75% and 2.38% fat; 13.66 and 13.24 MJ/kg). BW loss and backfat thickness loss were decreased (P < 0.05) by LPL supplementation. Backfat thickness at weaning was higher (P < 0.05) in sows fed LPL supplementation diets. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, gross energy and crude fat in sows fed LPL diets was increased (P < 0.05) compared with those fed non-LPL diets. Sows fed the high-fat diets had higher (P < 0.05) milk fat on day 10 and milk lactose on day 20 than those fed the low-fat diets. Milk fat and lactose concentrations in LPL supplementation treatments was increased (P < 0.05) compared with non-LPL treatments on day 10 and day 20, respectively. Positive interaction effects (P < 0.05) between fat and LPL were observed for milk fat concentration on day 10. In conclusion, LPL addition decreased BW loss and backfat thickness loss, improved nutrient digestibility and milk fat as well as milk lactose concentrations. In addition, there was a complementary positive effect of dietary fat and LPL supplementation on milk fat concentration in lactating sows.

AB A small amount of research has examined the association between the belief in free will and subjective well-being (SWB) among Western laypersons from individualist cultures. However, no study has examined this association among participants from collectivist cultures (e.g., Eastern Asian cultures). Therefore, in this study, we explored this association among two large, independent cohorts of Chinese adolescents (N-1 = 1,660; N-2 = 639; high school students). The belief in free will was measured by a self-reported questionnaire (Cohorts 1 and 2) and a two-alternative forced choice question regarding the existence of free will (Cohort 2). SWB included cognitive well-being (life satisfaction) and affective well-being (positive and negative affect) in both cohorts. Data analyses indicated that a stronger belief in free will was consistently associated with higher life satisfaction and positive affect in both cohorts. Our investigation provides evidence supporting the cultural generality of the positive effects of believing in free will on SWB.

AB The olivine-structured LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4/C composite is an alternative cathode material for lithium-ion batteries with excellent high-rate capability and cycle stability. A facile synthesis is achieved by applying a divalent transition metal phosphate as intermediate, spray drying, and annealing. A phosphate hydrate with a low degree of crystallinity is coprecipitated and characterized by XRD and SEM. SEM and TEM investigations show that the LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4/C particles are porous microspheres with a diameter of 2-5 mu m, and that the primary nanoparticles are wrapped by a 4-6nm-thick carbon layer. Compared with LiFePO4/C and LiMnPO4/C, the LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4/C microspheres exhibit higher energy density and enhanced discharge capacities of 156, 147, and 133mAhg(-1) at 0.1, 1 and 10C, respectively, as well as excellent cycle performance at high rates.

AB Combination treatment through simultaneous delivery of DNA and anticancer drugs with nanoparticles has been demonstrated to be an elegant and efficient approach for cancer therapy. Herein, we employed a combination therapy for eliminating both the tumor cells and intratumoral neovascular network based on the nanoplatform we designed. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) gene, a powerful antiangiogenic agent, and the clinically widely used chemotherapy agent paclitaxel (PTX) were simultaneously encapsulated in the same nanoparticle by a modified double-emulsion solvent evaporation method. The dual-drug-loaded nanoparticles (D/P-NPs) exhibited a uniform spherical morphology and released PTX and PEDF gene in a sustained manner. D/P-NPs showed an enhanced antitumor effect on C26 and A549 cells and a stronger inhibitory activity on proliferation of HUVECs. Moreover, D/P-NPs could dramatically elevate the PEDF expression levels in both C26 and A549 cells in comparison with PEDF gene loaded nanoparticles and significantly promote the cellular uptake of PTX. Additionally, microtubules were stabilized and G2/M phase arrest along with a higher subG1 cell population was induced by D/P-NPs in contrast to PTX or PTX loaded nanoparticles. Besides, D/P-NPs showed sustained release of PTX and PEDF gene in tumors as well as long-term gene expression. A significantly improved anticancer effect was also demonstrated in a C26 subcutaneous tumor model using this combinational therapy. D/P-NPs could sharply reduce the microvessel density and significantly promoted tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. More importantly, the in vivo distribution, serological and biochemical analysis, and H&E staining revealed that D/P-NPs had no obvious toxicity. Our study suggested that this novel polymeric nanomedicine had great potential for improving the therapeutic efficacy of combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer.

TI State-of-charge optimising control approach of battery energy storage

SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, configuring battery energy storage system (BESS) in wind farm has become the most popular method to smooth wind power fluctuation. The effectiveness of wind power fluctuation smoothing relies on the charging/discharging power control and state of charge (SOC) regulation of BESS. This study proposed a novel optimising SOC control approach for BESS in wind farm which could regulate wind power fluctuation in a suitable level and maintain SOC in an optimal range by utilising the wind power prediction information. A wind power prediction-based optimal SOC calculation module is designed to obtain an optimal range of SOC which makes BESS have enough capacity to smooth wind power fluctuation in a finite future period of time. It takes minimising over-charging and over-discharging time as optimisation objectives and biggest variations of wind farm outputting power within 1 and 10 min as restraint. A fuzzy self-adjusting of filter-based real-time control module is designed to smooth the wind power fluctuation in real time and regulate SOC to the optimal range. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated through implementing it in wind power smoothing control simulation experiments.

AB The alpine meadow in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has degraded in recent years; however, the response of soil macroinvertebrates to the alpine meadow degradation is unknown. We hypothesized that (i) soil macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance decrease gradually during alpine meadow degradation and (ii) the composition of soil macroinvertebrate communities is specific to particular degradation phases. We investigated the soil macroinvertebrates, plant communities and soil properties in a swampy meadow, grassland meadow, moderately degraded meadow and severely degraded meadow to test the hypotheses from April 2009 to October 2011. These areas represent four degradation phases of alpine meadows. The structure of the soil macroinvertebrate community in the moderately degraded meadow was notably different from that of the swampy meadow and the grassland meadow. Most of the macroinvertebrate groups disappeared from the severely degraded meadow. Taxonomic richness and abundance were significantly greater in the moderately degraded meadow and were significantly lower in the severely degraded meadow. Significant seasonal dynamics were only found for taxonomic richness in the moderately degraded meadow. Furthermore, the abundances of Polydesmida and Coleoptera differed significantly between the four habitats, but no significant seasonal changes were observed in the four habitats. The soil macroinvertebrate structures were influenced by the plant and soil variations, particularly the available soil P and K, the pH and vegetation heights, which changed significantly among the habitats. The soil macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness was also significantly correlated with the species richness, species coverage, vegetation height, aboveground biomass of the plant community, bulk density, organic matter, available soil N, P and K and pH. However, the abundances of the soil macroinvertebrate community and Polydesmida were only correlated with the available soil P and K, while Coleoptera was significantly correlated with all measured soil parameters, plant species richness and species coverage. Our results demonstrated that moderate and severe degradation in the alpine meadow have significant effects on the structure, diversity and abundance of soil macroinvertebrate communities, and the available soil P and K, pH and vegetation height are the determining factors. Our results also indicated that the soil macroinvertebrates in moderately degraded meadows will be more easily affected by climate changes in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HYDROGELS
AB Hydrogel actuators with controllable deformation and excellent biocompatibility are widely used in soft robot, valve, drug delivery and lenses. However, the stimulation response performance of existing hydrogel actuators mostly focuses on a single active layer, which greatly affects its driving performance and service life. In this work, we integrate temperature-responsive hydrogel (Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide), PNIPAM) and pH-responsive hydrogel (polyacrylic acid, PAAc) into one system to fabricate a dual active layer composite hydrogel actuator with high performance. Based on the PAAc hydrogels achieving contract or expand at different pH values, the obtained actuator exhibits admirable bidirectional bending characteristics. In addition, the anisotropic bamboo sheet endows the hydrogel actuator with programmable 3 D complex deformation. Benefitting from the synergy and different responsiveness between the two active layers, the hydrogel actuator not only has multiple response performance, but also greatly improves its deformation degree and response speed. More importantly, these promising properties of the actuator have broad application prospects in the development of pattern design and intelligent switch. This work proposes a promising strategy for the structural design of hydrogel actuators with excellent performance, and encourages more exploration of the application range of the actuator.

AB The pulsed current has been proposed to achieve fast charging and extend the lifetime of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. However, the optimal condition of the pulsed current is still inconclusive in previous studies. This article experimentally investigated the effect of the low-frequency positive pulsed current (PPC) charging on the lifetime and charging performance of Li-ion batteries. A two-stage degradation model of Li-ion batteries is developed to determine the inhibitory effect of the PPC on degradation mechanisms at different aging stages. Moreover, the changes in the internal resistance (IR) and the incremental capacity (IC) curve are provided to thoroughly explore the effects of the PPC on the degradation of Li-ion batteries. Compared with the traditional constant current (CC) charging, the lifetime, maximum rising temperature, and energy efficiency of the Li-ion batteries that were cycled by the PPC charging are improved by 81.6%, 60.5%, and 9.1%, respectively, after 1000 cycles. Therefore, low-frequency PPC charging should be considered as a promising charging strategy for Li-ion batteries.

AB The treatment of pharmaceutical and personal care products (abbreviated as PPCPs) have the problems of high energy consumption and low efficiency. Herein, an electro-Fenton (EF) coupled membrane filtration system was constructed to cost-efficiently degrade micromolecular carbamazepine (CBZ, a kind of PPCPs) from aquatic environment. Aqueous solution containing CBZ and the mixture of humic acid (HA, a kind of dissolved organic matters, with the molecular weight bigger than 400) was firstly filtered by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/ carbon fiber cloth composite cathode membrane, which rejected HA while let CBZ pass through the membrane. The CBZ was then participated in the following EF process and decomposed with high efficiency. In the EF process, Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (Fe-MOFs) derived magnetic nanoconfinement catalyst, with iron nanoparticle as core and porous carbon (PC) as shell (abbreviated as magnetic Fe@PC), was prepared and applied to the EF process. The results indicated the rejection rates of the cathode membrane towards HA and CBZ were 69.91% and 3.35%, respectively, indicating most of the HA was rejected in the filtering process. In the EF process, the magnetic Fe@PC exhibited excellent catalytic degradation performance towards CBZ, with a total removal rate of 98.34%. Among which, the contributions of different processes including adsorption, electro-degradation and EF degradation were 0.90%, 4.97%, and 89.08%, respectively. Quenching test indicated both center dot OH radical and center dot O2- radical played crucial roles during the degradation process, which were generated by the in -situ decomposition of H2O2 in the coexistence of the magnetic Fe@PC. Based on the degradation intermediates of CBZ, four probable degradation pathways were proposed, and the most accessible pathway was also verified by theoretical calculations. The eco-toxicity assessment results showed most of the intermediate products were in lower toxicity than CBZ. Besides CBZ, the system also exhibited excellent degradation performance towards various kinds of PPCPs. This work indicated the EF coupled cathode membrane system is one of the efficient technologies in the removal of PPCPs in complex water environment.

AB Considering the problem of food perishability and the environmental pollution of plastic packaging, the natural active packaging prepared by incorporating plant leaf (e.g. peony leaf) extract into biodegradable food packaging materials may be a key to addressing these issues. In the study, a novel green bioactive composite film (CS-PLE) with antioxidant and antibacterial propertiese was developed by blending peony leaf extract (PLE) into chitosan (CS) film through the solution casting method. The physical properties and biological activities of a series of films, including CS film and CS-PLEs incorporated with different concentrations of PLE, were studied by appropriate experimental protocols. The results demonstrated that addition of PLE improved thermal stability, the barrier performance of UV-A and total phenolic content of CS film, and the antioxidant activities of CS-PLEs increased by 60.6 % - 73.2 % with the appending proportion of PLE from 0.1 wt% - 0.7 wt% compared to CS film. Furthermore, CS-PLEs had better inhibiting effect on bacteria. Notably, CS-PLE (0.7 wt%) wrapping apples showed the least degree of browning among all the groups. Hence, the study of CS-PLEs can provide a new strategy for the preparation of food packaging materials that are green alternatives and reduce environmental pollution.

AB Manganese (Mn) poisoning can happen in the case of environmental pollution and occupational exposure. However, the underlying mechanisms of Mn-induced teste toxicity and whether mitochondrion and heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in toxic effect of Mn on chicken testes remain poorly understood. To investigate this, MnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O was administered in the diet (600, 900, and 1800 mg/kg Mn) of chickens for 30, 60, and 90 days. Electron microscopy and qPCR were performed. Results showed that Mn exposure suppressed dose- and time-dependently HSP40 and HSP60 mRNA levels, meanwhile increased does-dependently HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 mRNA levels at all three time points under three Mn exposure concentrations. Furthermore, Mn treatment damaged myoid cells, spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells through electron microscopic observation, indicating that Mn treatment damaged chicken testes. In addition, abnormal shapes of mitochondria were found, and mitochondria displayed extensive vacuolation. The increase of HSP90 and HSP70 induced by Mn exposure inhibited HSP40 and stimulated HSP27, respectively, in chicken testes, which needs further to be explored. Taken together, our study suggested that there was toxic effect in excess Mn on chickens, and HSPs and mitochondria were involved in the mechanism of dose-dependent injury caused by Mn in chicken testes. This study provided new insights for Mn toxicity identification in animal husbandry production practice.

AB The stability of a plant community is defined as its ability to resist and be resilient to changes. Plant community stability can be driven by a range of external perturbations as well as by plant community traits. Plant litter traits (species or mass) are widely recognized drivers for plant community composition and diversity changes in grasslands. Yet, the effects of litter traits on the temporal stability of plant communities in natural grasslands are largely unknown. In this study, a field experiment was conducted at an alpine meadow on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau to quantify the effects of litter from Elymus nutans, Kobresia setchwanensis and Ligularia virgaurea on the temporal stability of plant community biomass at five different mass levels (0, 100, 200, 400 and 600 g/m(2)). The experiment was conducted over the period from the pre-growth to peak-growth stage between 2017 and 2019, during which temporal stability of plant community biomass was assessed in relation to plant community characteristics. The effects of litter on temporal stability of plant community biomass were mainly driven by the litter mass rather than the litter species. A hump-shaped relationship between litter mass and temporal stability of plant community biomass was found, with the highest stability under intermediate litter mass treatment (200 g/m(2)). A structural equation model identified that this response was driven by the indirect effects of litter mass on the temporal stability of the biomass of the dominant (forbs) and subdominant (grasses) functional groups in the community and the asynchrony of plant functional groups. The results of this study demonstrate that plant litter traits are important drivers for maintaining plant community stability in natural grasslands, highlighting the importance of grassland management decisions (e.g. grazing intensity) relating to the quantity and quality of litter accumulation.

The self-assembled partner SpyCatcher and SpyTag were genetically fused with 2,3-butanediol hydrogenase and formate hydrogenase to produce KgBDH-SC (SpyCatcher-fused 2,3-butanediol hydrogenase) and FDH-ST (SpyTag-fused formate hydrogenase), respectively. After assembling the two fusion proteins, the complexes were then immobilized on the functionalized silicon dioxide nanoparticles by glutaraldehyde, forming KgBDH-SC-ST-FDH-SiO2 with the capability of reducing 2-hydroxyacetophenone to (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol with cofactor regeneration. Under the optimal conditions, the created co-immobilized enzymes performed 49% activity recovery compared with the mixture of free enzymes as well as showed 2.9-fold higher catalytic activity than the traditional random co-immobilized enzymes. Moreover, KgBDH-SC-ST-FDH-SiO2 showed better pH stability and organic solvents stability than the free enzymes, and remained 52.5% overall catalytic activity after 8 cycles. Finally, the co-immobilized enzymes can reduce 60 mM HAP for fabrication of (R)-PED with cofactor regeneration in the phosphate buffer reaction system, affording 83.9% yield and above 99% optical purity.

AB The Fe element is essential for human beings, but overdose of Fe leads to unwanted toxicity. However, overwhelming Fe accumulation in tumor cells could arouse strong oxidative stress for cancer therapy. Therefore, the fast and specific accumulation of Fe in tumor cells without systemic toxicity is critical for this purpose. Herein, we report that a carbon nanoparticles-Fe(II) complex (CNSI-Fe) could efficiently load Fe into tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth with low toxicity in H22 tumor-bearing mice. Upon intratumoral injection, CNSI-Fe only induced meaningful Fe increase in the tumor to significantly inhibit tumor growth with competitive efficiency to cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II). Fe accumulation stimulated the hydroxyl radical generation and serious oxidative stress in the tumor. Due to the lack of Fe accumulation in other tissues, CNSI-Fe was of low systemic toxicity to tumor-bearing mice. With the clinical success of CNSI for decades, CNSI-Fe might be used for cancer therapy through "off label" use to benefit patients immediately.

AB Understanding the influences of grazing exclusion (GE) on soil properties and vegetation characteristics is essential for the assessment of grassland restoration. The objectives of this study are exploring the efficiency of short-term GE in restoring alpine meadow in the Zoige region, eastern Tibetan Plateau, with high rainfall amount. We conducted sampling surveys before and after one-year GE in alpine meadows with seven sequent degraded degrees. The results showed that one-year GE significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil water content (SWC), and plant biomass, while decreased soil bulk density (SBD) regardless of the degradation degree. These findings suggest that short-term GE may be an effective way to restore degraded alpine meadow. Aboveground and belowground biomass was significantly positively associated with SWC, SOC, STN, soil total phosphorus, and soil available nitrogen, but presented negative relationship with SBD. This shows the complicated interaction between vegetation and soil physiochemical properties that regulates the grassland recovery process. The degraded alpine meadow in this rainfall-rich region could rapidly recover once grazing disturbance was excluded. This study can provide technical support for restoration and sustainable management of alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, ZnO nanocrystals and MoS2/ZnO composites were fabricated by a simple sol-gel method and ultrasonic concussion. Several characterization techniques including XRD, TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy and surface photovoltage were employed to explore the samples. The doping of MoS2 nanosheet into the ZnO nanocrystal composites was studied for its effect on NO2 gas-sensitivity under UV irradiation at room temperature. Compared to gas sensors developed from pure ZnO, those developed from ZnO/MoS2 exhibited higher sensitivity with a reversible response. Surface photovoltage results suggest that these desirable sensing features can be attributed to MoS2/ZnO heterojunctions and an abundance of diffusion channels which reduce the energy barrier to promote ready transference and target gas adsorption/desorption. These results offer new opportunities to fabricate composite materials for gas sensors.

AB The continually increasing nitrogen (N) deposition is expected to cause a saturation response of ecosystem aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). However, its underlying mechanisms, especially for the decrease of ANPP under high N addition rate, remain poorly understood. A field manipulative experiment was conducted to investigate the response of ANPP to six levels of N addition rate (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1)) in an alpine meadow during 2015-2017. We specifically explored four possible mechanisms, light limitation, biodiversity loss, soil acidification, and ammonium toxicity, underlying the saturation response of ANPP to increasing N addition. The results showed that ANPP increased linearly with N addition rates in 2015, while converted to a saturation response with N addition rates in 2016-2017. With increasing N addition rate, species richness and soil pH significantly reduced while standing litter, light limitation, and NH4+-N content significantly increased. Under low N addition rate (N0 to N4), increases in N availability significantly improved ANPP although it was partly offset by the indirect N effect via increasing litter accumulation and thus light competition. Under high N addition rate (N8-N32), the decreases in species richness mostly explained the N-induced reduction in ANPP, leading to a saturation response. This study provides empirical evidences on interpreting N saturation response of ANPP in the alpine meadow. The findings will advance our current understanding of N enrichment effects on ANPP and benefit biogeochemical models in parameterization and benchmark analysis.

AB Graphene adsorbents have been applied to remove diverse pollutants from aqueous systems. However, the mechanical strength of most graphene adsorbents is low and the fragile graphene sheets are released into the environment. In this study, we prepared carboxylated graphene oxide/chitosan/cellulose (GCCSC) composite beads with good mechanical strength for the immobilization of Cu2+ from both water and soil. The proportional limit of GCCSC beads was 3.2 N, a much larger value than graphene oxide beads (0.2 N). The largest pressure for GCCSC beads recorded before brittle failure was 26 N. The Cu2+ adsorption capacity of GCCSC beads was 22.4 mg/g in aqueous systems at initial Cu2+ concentration of 40 mu g/mL, which is competitive with many efficient adsorbents. The partition coefficient (PC) for the Cu2+ adsorption onto GCCSC beads was 1.12 mg/g/mu M at C-e of 0.83 mg/L and q(e) of 14.3 mg/g. The PC decreased to 0.055 mg/g/mu M at C-e of 26.0 mg/L and q(e) of 22.4 mg/g. The adsorption kinetics of Cu2+ on GCCSC beads were moderately fast and required approximately 3 h to reach equilibrium with a k(2) of 0.0021 g/(mg.min). A lower temperature and higher pH slightly increased the adsorption capacity of GCCSC beads. The ionic strength did not influence the adsorption. The porous structure of GCCSC beads blocked the direct contact between soil and the graphene surface; thus, a high Cu2+ immobilization efficiency was achieved by GCCSC beads applied to soil. The implications for the design of high-performance graphene adsorbents for water and soil remediation are discussed.

AB An orthogonal two dimensional analysis method based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry (ESI-IMS) detection was developed for the analysis of alkaloid compounds from Peganum harmala L seeds. Reverse phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) were compared for the most optimal performance using three different chromatographic columns. The experimental results suggest that HILIC mode is a better option for combining with the ESI-IMS system for higher sensitivity and ease in hyphenating. Under optimized conditions, alkaloids from different extraction phases were determined by means of the established HPLC-IMS method. More compounds from Peganum harmala L seed extracts were differentiated on the HPLC-ESI-IMS system by their retention time and drift time than by HPLC or ESI-IMS alone, and thirteen alkaloids were tentatively identified based on m/z and fragment ions using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Hence, our results indicate that this method can be considered to be advantageous over traditional absorbance detection methods for resolving complex mixtures because of complementary separation steps, elevated peak capacity, and higher sensitivity.

DE Biocompatible; Hydroxyapatite coating; Phytic acid; Osteogenic
AB As the basic component of natural bone in the human body, hydroxyapatite is widely used in orthopedic, dental, and bone implants, especially as a surface coating to improve osteoconductivity and osseointeration of materials. Several methods have been used for hydroxyapatite coating, including plasma spraying, laser pulse deposition, and electrophoretic and electrochemical deposition. However, these methods require expensive instruments and involve complex operations. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a feasible, simple, cheap, and universal method to prepare hydroxyapatite coatings. In this work, we develop a method for hydroxyapatite coating on various materials by a physic acid-metal complex multilayer. The abundant phosphate moieties on phytic acid not only work for chemical modification of a wide range of materials but also for further the formation of hydroxyapatite. The formed crystals improve the biocompatibility and osteogenic ability of MG63 cells. This method is simple, cheap, and novel, and can be utilized in biomedical applications such as orthopedic, dental, and bone implants.

AB Graphene nanomaterials are emerging environmental pollutants and their toxicity to plants requires careful investigation in environmental matrixes. Actually, the transportation of graphene in hydroponic systems is completely different to that in soil, which might affect the interaction between graphene and plants. In this study, we compared the toxicity of graphene oxide (GO) to naked oats (Avena sativa L.) in hydroponic and soil cultures. Serious toxicity of GO was only observed in hydroponic culture. GO induced the inhibition of biomass gain, seedling length and photosynthesis of naked oats. The root structure was disturbed by GO and oxidative stress was aroused in the root. In contrast, the soil (vermiculite) interacted strongly with GO and restricted the transportation of GO in soil. This reduced the contact between GO and the roots and largely alleviated its toxicity. Our results collectively suggested that environmental biosafety evaluation should consider the impact of environmental behaviors of nanomaterials to better reflect the real bioeffect of nanomaterials.

AB This paper investigates the problem of exponential synchronization for Markovian delayed complex dynamical networks (CDNs) via a sampled-data control scheme. First, a modified piecewise augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, which can fully capture the system characteristics and the available information on the actual sampling pattern. In comparison with existing results, the constraint condition of the positive definition of the LKF is more relax, since we take the LICE as a whole to examine its positive definite instead of restricting each term of it to positive definite. Second, by developing a novel convex optimization method, improved criteria are derived. Third, based on a new inequality of the neuron activation function, the desired sampled-data condoner is designed under a larger sampling interval. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ixabepilone is now a Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic option for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) whose disease has progressed despite prior anthracycline and taxane therapy. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of ixabepilone for treating metastatic breast cancer.
   A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Randomized controlled studies applying ixabepilone for treating MBC were included. The primary outcome was Overall Survival (OS). The authors of primary articles were contacted and methodological quality was evaluated. Subgroups were drawn based on intervention measures; heterogeneity and bias were discussed.
   Eight studies with 5247 patients were included. Compared with a weekly schedule, a triweekly schedule of ixabepilone was better at improving overall response rate (ORR), while there were no differences in improving OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Ixabepilone plus capecitabine was superior to capecitabine monotherapy in improving OS, PFS and ORR. Paclitaxel was more effective than ixabepilone in terms of OS and PFS. There was no difference in the improvement of ORR, clinical benefit rate (CBR) and disease control rate (DCR) between ixabepilone and eribulin.
   Current evidence suggests that a triweekly schedule of ixabepilone is more effective than weekly dosing in improving ORR. Use of ixabepilone in combination with capecitabine possesses superior clinical efficacy to the use of capecitabine alone. Paclitaxel was more effective than ixabepilone in terms of OS and PFS. The efficacy and safety between ixabepilone and eribulin were identical.

AB The effects of the interaction between tree species composition and altitude on soil microbial properties are poorly understood. In this study, soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected in August 2011 from Betula platyphylla and Picea crassifolia forests along two different altitudinal gradients. Soil microbial activity and biomass were measured using Biolog-ECO plates and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Both of the forest soils were characterized by a significantly lower soil pH (p < .05) and higher soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient levels (total nitrogen, available nitrogen and phosphorus) at higher altitudes compared with lower altitudes. Soil microbial activity was significantly lower in the birch forests (p < .05), but changed little in the spruce forests with increasing altitude. Soil microbial biomass decreased in the two forest soils across altitude gradients. With each 100-m drop in altitude, the soil microbial biomass exhibited a sharper decline in the spruce forests than in the birch forests. SOM had significant negative effects on soil microbial biomass, but no effects on soil microbial activity. Soil pH was significantly negative correlated with soil microbial biomass and activity. The tree species composition exhibited more negative effects on soil microbial biomass in the spruce forests, while altitude had a greater effect in the birch forests.

AB A piezoelectric immunosensor was developed for the detection of p16(INK4a), a protein that is expressed in liquid-based cervical cytology specimens and has been proved to be linked cervical cancer. Mouse polyclonal antibody against p16(INK4a) was bound onto the piezoelectric crystal surface in an ordered orientation using protein A. The antibody on the crystal could specifically adsorb p16(INK4a) and changes in the mass of the crystal would led to frequency shift. The supernatants from different clinical samples, including various cervical lesions, containing different concentration of p16(INK4a) were used for testing. Under the optimized conditions, the frequency shifts were linearly dependent on the antigen concentration in the range of 50-1200 ngmL(-1). The device showed a short analysis time (less than 30 min), good reproducibility (could be reused six times without any detectable loss of activity), stability (the immunosensor was stable for more than eight weeks when stored over silica gel blue at 4 C), and specificity. Attempts have been made to use the sensor for the initial screening for cervical lesion in cervical cytology specimen, and the relationship between cytologic and histologic findings, p16(INK4a) expression in various cervical lesions, including carcinoma been investigated.

AB By combining the advantages of poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium (PSSMA) with abundant anionic functional groups (-COO- and -SO3-), graphene oxide (GO) with high specific surface area and Fe3O4 nanoparticles with excellent magnetic responsiveness, a novel type of PSSMA-modified magnetic reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (PSSMA/M-rGO) was synthesized via a simple and facile one-step solvothermal method and used for removing cationic dyes from aqueous solutions in this study. The as-synthesized PSSMA/M-rGO was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, dynamic light scattering and nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique. Three typical cationic dyes, basic fuchsin (BF), crystal violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB) were used as model dye pollutants to evaluate the adsorption performance of the resultant PSSMA/M-rGO. The adsorption of three cationic dyes onto both PSSMA/M-rGO and M-rGO without PSSMA modification on the surface were systematically investigated at different experiment conditions. The results indicate that the binding of PSSMA on M-rGO can significantly enhance the adsorption capacities and removal efficiencies of the three dyes. This is due to the rich -COO- and -SO3- groups on PSSMA/M-rGO having strong electrostatic interactions with the positively charged dye molecules. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the three dyes onto both adsorbents demonstrate that the kinetics and equilibrium adsorptions can be well-described by pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir model, respectively. Moreover, the PSSMA/M-rGO nanocomposites also demonstrate high removal efficiencies toward mixed dyes of BF, CV and MB. Such functional nanocomposites with high adsorption capacity, low production cost and excellent recyclability, are promising as candidate adsorbents for highly-efficient removal of cationic organic pollutants from aqueous solutions.

AB Bark serves crucial roles in safeguarding trees physically and chemically, while also contributing to nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. Despite its importance, the broader biogeographical patterns and the potential factors influencing bark C : N : P stoichiometry in forest ecosystems remain largely unknown. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations in bark with 1240 records from 550 diverse forest sites to systematically analyze the large-scale patterns and the factors controlling bark C : N : P stoichiometry. The geometric means of bark C, N, and P concentrations were found to be 493.17 +/- 1.75, 3.91 +/- 0.09, and 0.2 +/- 0.01 mg g-1, respectively. Correspondingly, the C : N, C : P, and N : P mass ratios were 135.51 +/- 8.11, 3313.19 +/- 210.16, and 19.16 +/- 0.6, respectively. Bark C : N : P stoichiometry exhibited conspicuous latitudinal trends, with the exception of N : P ratios. These patterns were primarily shaped by the significant impacts of climate, soil conditions, and plant functional groups. However, the impact of evolutionary history in shaping bark C : N : P stoichiometry outweigh climate, soil, and plant functional group, aligning with the biogeochemical niche (BN) hypothesis. These finding enhance our understanding of the spatial distribution of bark nutrient stoichiometry and have important implications for modeling of global forest ecosystem nutrient cycles in a changing environment.

AB 4- tert butylphenol (4-tBP), a toxic environmental pollutant estrogen, received widespread attention due to its widespread presence, environmental persistence, and toxic effect. Common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) is the most important freshwater economic animal in China and is also a model animal for the study on molecular mechanisms of poisoning. Head kidney is a target organ attacked by environmental pollutants. Here, we established a common carp 4-tBP poisoning model. The results showed that exposure to 4-tBP resulted in mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum damage, and apoptotic damage in head kidneys of common carps using microstructure and ultrastructure observations, as well as TUNEL kit methods. Furthermore, we found at transcriptional level from three perspectives that 4-tBP induced apoptosis in common carp head kidney cells: Hippo pathway, mitochondrial pathway, and ER stress. Hippo pathway formed a complex network, in which LATS1 was a core gene. It's noteworthy that Hippo pathway triggered mitochondrial pathway through YAP/NR4A1/Bcl-2 and YAP/BIRC5/Caspase-9 pathways under 4-tBP-induced apoptosis. PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-Caspase-3 pathway was involved in 4-tBP-induced apoptosis via ER stress. Moreover, miR-203a mediated 4-tBP-induced apoptosis through targeting MST1, MAP4K4, and NR4A1. In addition, 4-tBP disrupted balance between oxidants and antioxidants, and caused oxidative stress, and oxidative stress mediated ER stress under 4-tBP-caused apoptosis via via H 2 O 2 -PERK-eIF2 alpha-ATF4-Caspase-3 pathway. miR-203a and oxidative stress participated in 4-tBP-induced apoptosis in common carp head kidney cells. For the first time, we found that Hippo pathway took part in molecular mechanism of fish poisoning, which needs to be investigated in the future. Our research provided foundational knowledge for exploring toxic effects of estrogen on fish and provided new insights into a theoretical basis for safety risk assessment for humans and fish, which deserves further profound exploration in the future. Moreover, the insights we generated help inform new strategies for preventing toxic injury in fish.

AB Despite the dominance of lead-based piezoelectric materials with ultrahigh electric-field-induced strain in actuating applications, seeking eco-friendly substitutes with an equivalent performance remains an urgent demand. Here, a strategy of regulating the irreversible non-180 degrees domain via phase engineering is introduced to optimize the available strain (the difference between the maximum strain and the remnant strain in a unipolar strain curve) in the lead-free potassium-sodium niobate-based piezoelectric ceramics. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rayleigh analysis reveal the contribution of the non-180 degrees domain to available strain in the tetragonal-orthorhombic-rhombohedral phase boundary. The reducing orthorhombic phase and increasing rhombohedral/tetragonal phase accompanied by the reduced irreversible non-180 degrees domain are obtained with increasing doping of Sb5+, resulting in an enlarged available strain due to the significantly lowered remnant strain. This optimization is mainly attributed to the reduced irreversible non-180 degrees domain wall motion and the increased lattice distortion, which are beneficial to decrease extrinsic contribution and enhance intrinsic contribution. The mesoscopic structure of miniaturized nanosized domain with facilitated domain switching also contributes to the enhancement of available strain due to the improved random field and decreased energy barrier. The study will shed light on the design of lead-free high-performance piezoelectric ceramics for actuator applications.
   Seeking eco-friendly materials with equivalent performance to lead-based piezoelectric materials remains an urgent demand. Here, the authors design potassium-sodium niobate-based lead-free piezoelectric materials with large potential.

AB As emerging pollutants, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have received extensive attention due to their high detection frequency (with concentrations ranging from ng/L to mu g/L) and potential risk to aqueous environments and human health. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective techniques for the removal of PPCPs from water environments. In AOPs, different types of free radicals (HO center dot, SO4 center dot(-), O-2 center dot(-), etc.) are generated to decompose PPCPs into non-toxic and small-molecule compounds, finally leading to the decomposition of PPCPs. This review systematically summarizes the features of various AOPs and the removal of PPCPs by different free radicals. The operation conditions and comprehensive performance of different types of free radicals are summarized, and the reaction mechanisms are further revealed. This review will provide a quick understanding of AOPs for later researchers.

AB Lightweight and sustainable aerogels have been a growing interest for thermal insulation applications due to current environmental and energy challenges. The design of cellulose-based aerogels with thermal insulation, hydrophobic, and oleophobic performance is the future development direction for building energy-efficient buildings. Herein, an anisotropic, lightweight, super-amphiphobic and thermal insulating rattan aerogel was fabricated by a three-step process of delignification, freeze-drying, and silylation. The prepared rattan aerogel exhibits anisotropic thermal properties with a low thermal conductivity of 0.030 W m(-1 )K(-1) in the radial direction and 0.056 W m(-1) K-1 in the axial direction due to the run-through channel skeleton and the structure of the insulating cages. Moreover, the silylated rattan aerogel shows super-amphiphobic performance (water contact angle-164 in the cross section and-156 in the radial section; oil contact angle-158 in the cross section and-154 in the radial section). The excellent anisotropic thermal performance, abundance, sustain-ability, and superb amphiphobicity of the rattan aerogel make it highly promising for green buildings and thermal management applications.

AB Sodium bismuthate dihydrate (NaBiO3.2 H2O, NBH) nanosheets were successfully prepared in this study using the persulfate oil bath oxidation method. Benefited from the unique layered structure of NBH, the Fe(III) as a variable valence metal ion was explored for enhancing NBH activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade levofloxacin (LVF) in the visible-light catalytic system. Based on results of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)) were identified as the main ROS. The morphology, chemical structure, and optical properties of NBH were analyzed using various characterization methods. It was confirmed that Fe(III) embedded in the NBH via the ion exchange with Na, resulting in lattice oxygen vacancies on the surface of the NBH, after the formation of oxygen defect sites, reacts with PMS in the solution to produce active oxygen species with oxidizing efficiency. This study expands the technological application of NBH in the catalytic oxidation of variable valence metals, which are essential for the removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.

AB This paper deals with the stability problem of T-S fuzzy systems (TSFSs) with hybrid communication delays (HCDs). Compared with traditional communication delays, HCDs with Bernoulli distributed white noise sequences not only involve probabilistic discrete time-varying delays but also random additive time-varying delays (ATVDs). Based on the delay-product-type function (DPTF) and the second derivative method, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is developed, which fully considers the information of various communication delays. Moreover, by using novel integral inequalities and stochastic analysis theory, new stabilization criteria are established. Meanwhile, the desired fuzzy state feedback controller with HCDs and parallel distributed compensation (PDC) is designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In the end, the usefulness of the obtained theoretical results is illustrated through two numerical simulation examples. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Strong oxidant intermediates and the formation of byproducts during the discharge/charge process are the main challenges in the degradation of lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs). A facile approach to maintain the stability of the cathode catalyst and avoid the formation of byproducts is essential for the development of LOBs. Here, a sawdust-derived carbon catalyst is fabricated and subjected to surface phosphatization to suppress corrosion between carbon and electrolyte/products. This prevents the formation of byproducts from parasitic reactions and boosts the reaction kinetics of the carbon catalyst in LOBs. The doped P atoms will prior to substitute an N atom in pyrrolic-N sites to form graphitic P-N sites, instead of the graphitic P-C sites. Experimental and density functional theory calculations reveal that the graphitic P-N sites can function as a reaction kinetics promoter for the formation/decomposition of discharge products. Moreover, the graphitic P-N sites can also prevent the formation of byproduct Li2CO3 from the corrosion of the carbon catalyst, despite its poor catalytic capability in LOBs. As a result, the sawdust-derived P-doped catalyst exhibits an enhanced specific capacity of approximate to 20 000 mAh g(-1) and long cycle stability of 226 and 160 cycles at 200 and 500 mA g(-1), respectively.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cyperi Rhizoma (CR) derives from the rhizome or tuber of Cyperus rotundus L. of Cyperaceae. It is an herbal medicine which has been widely used in different healthcare systems like in China, India, Iran, and Japan. In Chinese medicine, CR could promote the flow of Qi in the Liver and Sanjiao channels, regulate menstruation and alleviate pain. Clinically, CR is used for depression, flatulence, hypochondriac pain, and dysmenorrhea. Thus, it has a long history and significant curative effect for the treatment of various Qi stagnation symptoms. Aim of this review: This review focuses on explaining the major antidepressant mechanisms of CR, and assessing the shortcomings of existing work. Besides, clinical applications, pharmacological effects and their corresponding chemical compositions and quality control of CR have been researched. Materials and methods: The search terms "Cyperus rotundus L." was used to obtain the literatures from electronic databases such as Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The information provided in this review to illustrate material basis of CR were only limited to papers which reported on the chemical compositions and pharmacological effects simultaneously. Result: The study showed that CR has significant application in Qi stagnation, like depressed liver, stomach, and bowel disorders, etc. in different countries or districts. Aqueous extract, EtOH extract, essential oil, total oligomeric flavonoids and five other extracts were effective constituents displaying pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antihemolytic, and anti-inflammatory effect. 41 kinds of specific components like alpha-cyperone, nootkatone exhibited corresponding pharmacological activities mentioned above. Different concentrations of ethanol extract, essential oil, decoction of CR and monomer composition like alpha-cyperone, rotunduside G had anti-depressant effects. Conclusions: In the present study, we have provided scientific information and research developments on traditional uses, phytochemical compositions and corresponding pharmacological activities, and quality control status on CR. The antidepression effect and its corresponding chemical compositions were generalized separately. The pharmacological activities studies should be more focused on the reflection of traditional clinical values. CR could be a significant potential herbal medicine to develop antidepressant drugs with lower side effects.

AB Background On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the roof ridge of the world, the yak is a precious cattle species that has been indispensable to the human beings living in this high-altitude area. However, the origin of domestication, dispersal route, and the divergence of domestic yaks from different areas are poorly understood. Results Here, we resequenced the genome of 91 domestic yak individuals from 31 populations and 1 wild yaks throughout China. Using a population genomics approach, we observed considerable genetic variation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the earliest domestications of yak occurred in the south-eastern QTP, followed by dispersal to the west QTP and northeast to SiChuang, Gansu, and Qinghai by two routes. Interestingly, we also found potential associations between the distribution of some breeds and historical trade routes such as the Silk Road and Tang-Tibet Ancient Road. Selective analysis identified 11 genes showing differentiation between domesticated and wild yaks and the potentially positively selected genes in each group were identified and compared among domesticated groups. We also detected an unbalanced pattern of introgression among domestic yak, wild yak, and Tibetan cattle. Conclusions Our research revealed population genetic evidence for three groups of domestic yaks. In addition to providing genomic evidence for the domestication history of yaks, we identified potential selected genes and introgression, which provide a theoretical basis and resources for the selective breeding of superior characters and high-quality yak.

AB Rational design of multi-component heterostructure photocatalyst is capable of combining the advantages of the different components. Here, a ternary CuO-ZnO-Ag nano-composite was fabricated by a facile sol-gel method for the photodegradation of organic dye pollutants in wastewater. Decorating Ag NPs on the surfaces of CuO-ZnO nanocomposites improves their photocatalytic activities, which can be further enhanced by tuning the Ag loading level. At 2 mol%, the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of CuO-ZnO nanocomposites for methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), rhodamine b (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation, and for MB under visible light irradiation are increased by 42%, 42%, 63% and 78%, respectively. The enhanced efficiencies can be attributed to the strengthened visible light absorption and the lower recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. This work will trigger an inspiration for lowering the dosage of noble metal in photocatalyst by building the simple multiheterostructure consisting of the low-cost metal elements.

AB The male infertility of cattleyak resulted from spermatogenic arrest has greatly restricted the effective utilization of the heterosis from crossbreeding of cattle and yak. Based on our previous studies, the significant divergences of the transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing between yak and cattleyak prompt us to investigate the critical roles of microRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis. TUNEL-POD analysis presented sharply decreased spermatogenic cell types and the increased apoptotic spermatogonia in cattleyak. The STA-PUT velocity sedimentation was employed to obtain spermatogonia and spermatocytes from cattle, yak and cattleyak and these spermatogenic cells were verified by the morphological and phenotypic identification. MicroRNA microarray showed that 27 differentially expressed miRNAs were simultaneously identified both in cattleyak vs cattle and in cattleyak vs yak comparisons. Further analysis revealed that the down-regulation of bta-let-7 families, bta-miR-125 and bta-miR-23a might impair the RA-induced differentiation of spermatogonia. Target gene analysis for differentially expressed miRNAs revealed that miRNAs targeted major players involved in vesicle-mediated transport, regulation of protein kinase activity and Pathways in cancer. In addition, spermatogonia transfection analysis revealed that the down-regulation of bta-miR-449a in the cattleyak might block the transition of male germ cells from the mitotic cycle to the meiotic program. The present study provided valuable information for future elucidating the regulatory roles of miRNAs involved in spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak.

AB The effects of interactions of soil type and soil depth on soil C:N:P stoichiometry and microorganisms are poorly understood. In this study, soil samples (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, 50-100 cm) were collected from two soil types (Haplic luvisols and Eutric cambisols) in Sabina przewalskii Kom. forest of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The soil C:N ratio and soil microbial biomass (SMB) measured using phospholipid fatty acid in Eutric cambisols were significantly higher than in Haplic luvisols, while soil C:P and N:P ratios were the opposite. In the two soil types, the soil C:N ratio significantly increased with soil depth, and the soil C:P and N:P ratios declined. Structural equation modelling (SEM) indicated that soil depth directly affected soil C, N and P contents. Soil type and soil depth could directly affect soil fungal and bacterial biomass, and indirectly affect both of them through soil bulk density. Meanwhile soil fungal biomass was influenced by soil depth through Total C. These results highlighted that the vertical distribution of soil bacteria could largely be attributed to changes of soil fungi depending on soil carbon resources.

AB Antibiotics are important for treating bacterial infection; however, efficacies and side effects of antibiotics vary in medicine and experimental models. A few studies have correlated microbiota composition variations with health outcomes in response to antibiotics; however, no study has demonstrated causality. We had noted variation in colonic expression of C-type lectins, regenerating islet-derived protein 3 beta (Reg3 beta) and Reg3 gamma, after metronidazole treatment in a mouse model. To investigate the effects of specific variations in the preexisting microbiome on host response to antibiotics, mice harboring a normal microbiota were allocated to 4 treatments in a 2-by-2 factorial arrangement with or without commensal Escherichia coli and with or without metronidazole in drinking water. E. coli colonized readily without causing a notable shift in the microbiota or host response. Metronidazole administration reduced microbiota biodiversity, indicated by decreased Chao1 and Shannon index values, and altered microbiota composition. However, the presence of E. coli strongly affected metronidazole-induced microbiota shifts. Remarkably, this single commensal bacterium in the context of a complex population led to variations in host responses to metronidazole treatment, including increased expression of antimicrobial peptides Reg3 beta and Reg3 gamma and intestinal inflammation indicated by tumor necrosis factor alpha levels. Similar results were obtained from 2-week antibiotic exposure and with additional E. coli isolates. The results of this proof-of-concept study indicate that even minor variations in initial commensal microbiota can drive shifts in microbial composition and host response after antibiotic administration. As well as providing an explanation for variability in animal models using antibiotics, the findings encourage the development of personalized medication in antibiotic therapies.
   IMPORTANCE This work provides an understanding of variability in studies where antibiotics are used to alter the gut microbiota to generate a host response. Furthermore, although providing evidence only for the one antibiotic, the study demonstrated that initial gut microbial composition is a key factor driving host response to antibiotic administration, creating a compelling argument for considering personalized medication based on individual variations in gut microbiota.

AB Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films with gradient nitrogen (N) doping were synthesized by direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering method. The effects of N doping on composition, adhesion, mechanical, tribological and morphological properties were investigated by Raman spectra, nano-scratch tester, nano-indenter and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of nano-scratch tester showed that the adhesion of DLC film was enhanced due to N introduction. The results of AFM, nano-scratch tester and nano-indenter showed that the doping method of gradient increased N component had a significant improvement in surface roughness and mechanical properties compared with the conventional N doping method. The gradient N doping (N-G-DLC) films also exhibited better tribological properties compared to conventional N doping (N-c-DLC) film. The adhesion and roughness were well achieved and improved simultaneously by utilizing a gradient N-doped deposition method for the first time. The relationship between tribological and mechanical properties was deduced and demonstrated. A model based on wave superposition theorem was built to interpret the relationship between surface roughness and N concentration during the deposition. The simulation results showed great agreement with the experimental results.

   UPTAKE
AB A rational combination is critical to achieve efficiently synergistic therapeutic efficacy for tumor treatment. Hence, we designed novel antitumor combinations (T-NPs) by integrating the tumor vascular and tumor cells dual-targeting ligand with antiangiogenesis/antitumor agents. The truncated bFGF peptide (tbFGF), which could effectively bind to FGFR1 overexpressed on tumor neovasculature endothelial cells and tumor cells, was selected to modify PLGA nanoparticles (D/P-NPs) simultaneously loaded with PEDF gene and paclitaxel in this study. The obtained T-NPs with better pharmaceutical properties had elevated cytotoxicity and enhanced expression of PEDF and alpha-tubulin on FGFR1-overexpressing cells. The uptake of T-NPs increased in C26 cells, probably mediated by tbFGF via specific recognization of the overexpressed FGFR1. T-NPs dramatically disrupted the tube formation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and displayed improved antiangiogenic activity in the transgenic zebrafish model and the alginate-encapsulated tumor cell model. More importantly, T-NPs achieved a markedly higher antitumor efficacy in the C26 tumor-bearing mice model. The antitumor effect involved the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, and down-regulation of FGFR1. The enhanced antitumor activity of T-NPs probably resulted from the raised distribution in tumor tissues. In addition, T-NPs had no obvious toxicity as evaluated by weight monitoring, serological/biochemical analyses, and H&E staining. These results revealed that T-NPs, an active targeting gene/chemo-therapy, indeed had superior antitumor efficacy and negligible side effect, suggesting that this novel combination is a potential tumor therapy and a new treatment strategy and that the tbFGF modified nanoparticles could be applied to a wide range of tumor-genetic therapies and/or tumor-chemical therapies.

AB H2O2 as a green oxidant plays a crucial role in numerous green chemical reactions. However, how to improve its activation and utilization efficiency as well as regulate the distribution of ROS remains a pressing challenge. In this work, a sulfur quantum dots (SQDs) modified zero-valent iron (SQDs@ZVI) was delicately designed and prepared, whose iron sites can coordinate with strongly electronegative sulfur atoms to construct highly reactive Fe-S dual active sites, for high-efficient selective H2O2 activation and utilization with potent (OH)-O-center dot production. Experimental tests, in situ FTIR/Raman spectra and theoretical calculations demonstrated that SQDs modulates the local coordination structure and electronic density of iron centers, thus effectively enhancing its Fenton reactivity and promoting the rate-limiting H2O2 adsorption and subsequent barrierless dissociation of peroxyl bonds into (OH)-O-center dot via the formation of bridged S-O-O-Fe complexes. Consequently, substantial generated surface-bound (OH)-O-center dot induced by the highly reactive Fe-S dual sites enabled excellent degradation of miscellaneous organic pollutants over a broad pH range (3.0-9.0). The developed device-scale Fenton filter realized durable performance (up to 200 h), verifying the vast potential of SQDs@ZVI with diatomic sites for practical application. This work presents a promising strategy to construct metal-nonmetal diatomic active sites toward boosting selective activation and effective utilization of H2O2, which may inspire the design of efficient heterogeneous Fenton reaction for water decontamination.

AB The characteristic aroma compounds of traditional braised pork were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O), odor-activity values, and aroma recombination and omission experiments. A total of 56 volatile compounds were detected by GC-MS, among which hexanal, octanal, nonanal, ( E )-2- octenal, 2,3-octanedione, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-pentylfuran, methanethiol, and dimethyl trisulfide were identified as the key aroma compounds by molecular sensory science. Partial least squares regression analysis indicated that some aroma compounds significantly contributed to fatty (hexanal, heptanal, 2-pentylfuran, nonanal, and ( E )-2- octenal), meaty (methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and octanal), sauce-like flavor (3-hydroxy-2-butanone and 2-furfural), and sweet, caramel (2,3-octanedione, 1-octen-3-ol). Lean meat produced more aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and sulfur-containing compounds than subcutaneous fat. The seasonings (saccharose, cooking wine, and soy sauce) facilitated the formation of ethyl L-lactate, 2-acetylfuran, 2-furfural, 5methyl-2-furaldehyde, 2-methyl-pyrazine, and 2-acetylpyrrole. Meanwhile they reduced the content of lipid oxidation products, thereby stimulated the characteristic aroma of the Chinese traditional braised pork.

AB With the massive urbanization and industrialization in China, the paradox between fast modernization and cultural preservation arouses challenges on new insight into green construction and sustainable development strategies throughout the nation. Particularly, how to strike a balanced cultural-modern rural revitalization has become a research priority, especially for cultural and historical villages in relatively under developed western regions. In this paper, taking Gaotunzi Village, a traditional ethnic village in western high-altitude plateau as an illustrative example, the typical green design manner and optimization strategy are proposed for cultural and architectural heritage preservation. The detailed architecture and structure design is conducted for both old temple retrofitting and new museum construction, with consideration for retaining traditional building colors, styles, and materials. Moreover, land use planning is demonstrated for local public space and services upgrading. The overall design strategy has been taken into practice for the local renovation construction program. The preliminary results indicate that this green retrofitting idea and approach are quite locally feasible for sustainable rural revitalization with local heritage conservation, including traditional wooden buildings, Buddhism belief, Tibetan icons, and ethnic symbolic culture preservation and promotion. This work can provide a typical design reference and application prototype for rural construction and modernization with local heritage preservation considerations, especially for those traditional villages in developing countries.

AB Skeletal muscle is a complex heterogeneous tissue and characterizing its cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional and epigenetic signatures are important for understanding the details of its ontogeny. In our study, we applied scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to investigate the cell types, molecular features, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, and patterns of developing bovine skeletal muscle from gestational, lactational and adult stages. Detailed molecular analyses were used to dissect cellular heterogeneity, and we deduced the differentiation trajectory of myogenic cells and uncovered their dynamic gene expression profiles. SCENIC analysis was performed to demonstrate key regulons during cell fate decisions. We explored the future expression states of these heterogeneous cells by RNA velocity analysis and found extensive networks of intercellular communication using the toolkit CellChat. Moreover, the transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility modalities were confirmed to be highly concordant, and integrative analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression revealed key transcriptional regulators acting during myogenesis. In bovine skeletal muscle, by scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis, different cell types such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, monocytes, pericyte cells and eight skeletal myogenic subpopulations were identified at the three developmental stages. The pseudotime trajectory exhibited a distinct sequential ordering for these myogenic subpopulations and eight distinct gene clusters were observed according to their expression pattern. Moreover, specifically expressed TFs (such as MSC, MYF5, MYOD1, FOXP3, ESRRA, BACH1, SIX2 and ATF4) associated with muscle development were predicted, and likely future transcriptional states of individual cells and the developmental dynamics of differentiation among neighbouring cells were predicted. CellChat analysis on the scRNA-seq data set then classified many ligand-receptor pairs among these cell clusters, which were further categorized into significant signalling pathways, including BMP, IGF, WNT, MSTN, ANGPTL, TGFB, TNF, VEGF and FGF. Finally, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq results were successfully integrated to reveal a series of specifically expressed TFs that are likely to be candidates for the promotion of cell fate transition during bovine skeletal muscle development. Overall, our results outline a single-cell dynamic chromatin/transcriptional landscape for normal bovine skeletal muscle development; these provide an important resource for understanding the structure and function of mammalian skeletal muscle, which will promote research into its biology.

AB Carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrid materials with excellent physicochemical properties can be widely ap-plied in the fields of energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensing, etc. Reducing the self-stacking and achiev-ing covalent interaction between carbon nanotubes and graphene are important to ensure a stable hi-erarchical architecture and effective mass transfer. Herein, we propose a one-step strategy to synthesize 3D interconnected carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrids on the easy-to-remove biomass-derived substrate. The calcined natural cuttlebone as bi-functional catalyst precursor can simultaneously grow carbon nan-otubes and graphene by one-step chemical vapor deposition without the addition of extra metal catalysts, while the interconnected structure can act as the porous template for graphene growth. The simultane-ous growth process can obtain covalent bonding between carbon nanotubes and graphene, while the crystalline quality and interlayer space can be adjusted by different carbon sources and growth parame-ters (e.g., temperature). The one-step grown carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrids with seamless interfaces and hierarchical interconnected 3D structure can effectively enhance the electron transfer as well as the electrolyte infiltration efficiency. When utilized as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode, a high specific ca-pacity (544 mAh g -1 at 0.1 A g -1 ), good rate capability (200 mAh g -1 at 6.4 A g -1 with an ultrashort charge time of 113 s), and excellent cyclic stability can be achieved. This simple and one-step carbon nanotubes/graphene hybrids fabrication strategy can be easily scale-up and applied in various fields.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

AB Melanoidins contribute to the sensory and functional properties of dark beers. The structure, stability, and antioxidant activity of acetone precipitation extracted melanoidins (APE-M) and macroporous resin adsorption extracted melanoidins (MAE-M) from dark beer were investigated. The structural properties of melanoidins were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), circular dichroism (CD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the solution storage stability, thermal behavior and antioxidant activity of melanoidins in dark beers were evaluated. MAE-M revealed more sophisticated structures than APE-M, including more concrete characteristics of Maillard reaction (MR) products in FTIR (1550-1500 cm-1), more ordered secondary structure in CD spectra, and thinner slices as well as more microspheres in SEM. The solution storage stability assay showed that certain factors, including 55 degrees C, 5 % v/v ethanol, UV light, and H2O2 solution, accelerated the degradation of melanoidins. The moderate extraction process of MAE-M performed a minor enthalpy change (-92.28 Jg- 1) in the DSC-TG test than that of APE-M (-319.41 Jg- 1). Furthermore, the ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities and the FRAP assay demonstrated that the antioxidant activity of MAE-M was almost twice that of APE-M. In general, MAE was more effective in extracting beer melanoidins while maintaining its accurate structure and profitable antioxidant activity than APE.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the intestinal flora potentially contributes to the occurrence and development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Phyllanthus emblica (PE), an edible and medicinal natural resource, exerts excellent effects on ameliorating NAFLD, but the potential mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, a mouse NAFLD model was established by administering a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD). The protective effects of the aqueous extract of PE (AEPE) on the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in NAFLD mice were detected by performing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The administration of middle- and high-dose AEPE decreased the levels of ALT, AST, LDL-C, TG, and Hyp and increased HDL-C levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (H & E), Oil Red O, and Masson's trichrome staining indicated that AEPE treatment attenuated hepatic steatosis and fibrotic lesions. Moreover, the disordered intestinal microflora was remodeled by AEPE, including decreases in the abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae, Faecalibaculum, and Romboutsia. The untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that AEPE restored the disturbed glutathione metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis of the gut bacterial community in NAFLD mice, which strongly correlated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Collectively, AEPE potentially ameliorates NAFLD induced by a CDAHFD through a mechanism associated with its modulatory effects on the gut microbiota and microbial metabolism.

AB Agro-tourism integration is a breakthrough to flourish rural industries and fulfill rural revitalization. Also, agricultural eco-efficiency and agro-tourism integration are closely linked, so investigating the relationship between the two is significant for realizing high-quality agro-ecological development in China. However, existing studies have ignored the impact of agro-tourism integration on agricultural eco-efficiency. For this purpose, using a dataset of 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2001 to 2019, this paper employs the Entropy weight approach and super efficient Slack-Based Measure (SBM`) approach to measure the agro-tourism integration level and agricultural eco-efficiency, respectively. The system Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) approach is applied to investigate the effect of agro-tourism integration on agricultural eco-efficiency. The statistical results reveal that agro-tourism integration significantly contributes to agricultural eco-efficiency, which remains valid after the robustness checks are executed. There is also significant path-dependence of agro-tourism integration. Finally, agro-tourism integration significantly contributes to agricultural eco-efficiency in the eastern region, while it significantly inhibits agricultural eco-efficiency in the central-western region. Our findings suggest that policymakers not only reinforced the deep integration of agriculture and tourism to stimulate the overall rural revitalization, but also formulated agro-tourism integration policies in a differentiated and green manner to contribute to agricultural eco-efficiency growth.

AB Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of cells generated in various pathologic conditions, which have been known to be key components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) involving in tumor immune tolerance. So MDSCs have been extensively researched recently. As its name suggests, immunosuppression is the widely accepted function of MDSCs. Aside from suppressing antitumor immune responses, MDSCs in the TME also stimulate tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, thereby promoting tumor growth and development. Therefore, altering the recruitment, expansion, activation, and immunosuppression of MDSCs could partially restore antitumor immunity. So, this view focused on the favorable TME conditions that promote the immunosuppressive effects of MDSCs and contribute to targeted therapies with increased precision for MDSCs.</p>

ID CYCLIC GMP-AMP
AB While the functions of STING1 (stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1) during DNA virus infection had been well documented, the roles STING1 plays during RNA viruses infection is obscure. Infection with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a well-known picornavirus, induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and autophagy. Here, we found that the FMDV-induced integrated stress response originates from the cellular pattern recognition receptor DDX58/RIG-I (DExD/H-box helicase 58). DDX58 transmits signals to the ER-anchored adaptor protein STING1, which specifically activates the EIF2AK3/PERK (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A)-dependent integrated stress response and finally leads to reticulophagy and degradation of STING1 itself. Knockdown/knockout of STING1 or EIF2AK3 suppresses FMDV genome replication and viral protein expression. Reticulophagy induction by STING1 does not require its translocation to the Golgi or IFN response activation. However, STING1 polymerization is necessary for the FMDV-induced integrated stress response and reticulophagy. Our work illustrated the signaling cascades that mediate the cellular stress response to FMDV infection and indicated that induction of autophagy in response to both DNA and RNA virus infection may be an evolutionarily conserved function of STING1.

AB In this study, the microbial interactions among cocul-tures of Streptococcus thermophilus (St) with potential probiotics of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (Ba) and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lp) in fermented milk were investigated during a storage period of 21 d at 4 degrees C, in terms of acidifying activity (pH and ti -tratable acidity), viable counts, and metabolites. A nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was employed for mapping the global metabolite profiles of fermented milk. Probiotic strains cocultured with St accelerated milk acidifica-tion, and improved the microbial viability compared with the single culture of St. The St-Ba/Lp treatment manifested a higher bacteria viability and acidification ability in comparison with the St-Ba or the St-Lp treatment. Relative quantitation of 179 significant metabolites was identified, including nucleosides, AA, short peptides, organic acids, lipid derivatives, carbohy-drates, carbonyl compounds, and compounds related to energy metabolism. The principal component analysis indicated that St treatment and coculture treatments displayed a complete distinction in metabolite profiles, and Lp had a larger effect than Ba on metabolic pro -files of fermented milk produced by cofermentation with St during storage. The heat map in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the abundance of metabolites significantly varied with the starter cultures over the storage, and high abundance of metabolites was observed in either St or coculture samples. The St-Ba/Lp treatment showed relatively high abundance for the vast majority of metabolites. These findings suggest that the profile of the metabo-lites characterizing fermented milk samples may depend on the starter cultures, and incorporation of probiotics may considerably influence the metabolomic activities of fermented milks.

AB The ever-growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens and their biofilms based persistent, chronic infections has created an urgent call for new strategies to deal with multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR). Near-infrared (NIR) laser-induced photothermal treatment (PTT) of gold nanorods (AuNRs) disinfects microbes by local heating with low possibility to develop resistant. However, PTT disinfection strategy of AuNRs alone shows less efficiency in killing multidrug resistant strains (i.e. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) and their matured biofilms. Herein, a novel synergistic chemo-photothermal integrated antimicrobial platform (P(Cip-b-CB)AuNRs) was fabricated which show enhanced killing efficiency against MRSA in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes. Polymethacrylate copolymers with pendant ciprofloxacin (Cip) and the carboxyl betaine groups (P (Cip-b-CB)) were synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. P (Cip-b-CB) was decorated onto AuNRs via gold-thiol bond which resulted in AuNRs with acidic-induced surface charge-switchable activities and lipase triggered Cip release properties (P(Cip-b-CB)-AuNRs). The lower pH value and overexpress of lipase are characteristics for microenvironment of microbial infections and their biofilms, which ensure the targeting on, penetration into and on-demand release of Cip from the nanocomposites in bacterial infection sites and their biofilms. The bacterial cell membrane was disrupt by photothermal therapy which could improve its permeability and sensitivity to antibiotics, meanwhile lipase-triggered release of Cip ensures a high concentration of antibiotics at the site of bacterial infection. Besides their NIR induced PTT disinfection activities, the increased local temperature generated by NIR light irradiation accelerated Cip release which further enhanced the antibacterial efficiency, leading to synergistic antibacterial activities of chemophotothermal therapy. Taken together, the designed synergistic chemo-photothermal integrated antimicrobial platform is a promising antibacterial agent for fighting MDR bacterial infections and their biofilms.

AB Neuroticism is major higher-order personality trait and has been robustly associated with mental and physical health outcomes. Although a growing body of studies have identified neurostructural markers of neuroticism, the results remained highly inconsistent. To characterize robust associations between neuroticism and variations in gray matter (GM) structures, the present meta-analysis investigated the concurrence across voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies using the anisotropic effect size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM). A total of 13 studies comprising 2,278 healthy subjects (1,275 females, 29.20 +/- 14.17 years old) were included. Our analysis revealed that neuroticism was consistently associated with the GM structure of a cluster spanning the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and extending to the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex (dACC/mPFC). Meta-regression analyses indicated that the neuroticism-GM associations were not confounded by age and gender. Overall, our study is the first whole-brain meta-analysis exploring the brain structural correlates of neuroticism, and the findings may have implications for the intervention of high-neuroticism individuals, who are at risk of mental disorders, by targeting the dACC/mPFC.

DT Article
DE Bamboo; Chemical dyeing; Moisture adsorption; Anti-microbial corrosion
AB Bamboo, as a potential ecological building material, has attracted a lot of attention, due to its wide distribution, more than 1000 species, short growth cycle of 3-5 years, three times the carbon dioxide adsorption of other plants, and tensile strength comparable to steel or concrete. The major challenges of bamboo are the single color and poor anti-microbial corrosion, based on the intrinsic nature of polysaccharides such as cellulose. In this work, a novel bamboo composite material that exhibits a rich variety of colors (red wine, light yellow, coffee, white, black), excellent color retention, and anti-microbial corrosion for 14 days under a relative humidity of 60-95% is prepared by an easy-to-scale chemical grafting method. Oxidation treatment is the basic condition for bamboo to obtain bright colors, and the substitution reaction of the carbon heterocyclic ring of polysaccharide molecules is the inherent reason for bamboo dyeing. For instance, the bamboo treated with nitric acid presents a bright red wine color, and C=N, -NO2 functional groups are detected. Polyethylene glycol filled in the three-dimensional network avoids the water-soluble nutrients from emigrating to the surface of bamboo. The interruption of the continuous supply route allows the modified bamboo to obtain excellent antibacterial performance. Bright color and anti-microbial corrosion characteristics make the modified bamboo as a green building material has more potential applications.

AB In satellite communication systems, satellite power and processing capacities are limited, which means that storage and security are also constrained. Satellite communication channels are extremely vulnerable to hackers and external interference signals. Protecting satellite networks from illegal information access and use can be extremely challenging. In this paper, an architecture composed of satellite and ground equipment is developed that integrates communication network authentication and privacy protection structures. In the proposed scheme, the communication, registration, authentication, and revocation of information are achieved through stages to improve communication security. The satellite forwards the collected information to a ground base station, which has a strong data processing capacity. The ground base station records all the key parameters in the distributed blockchain, and all malicious node certificates are removed from the system. To further enhance data transmission security, the key is transferred using an asymmetric encryption algorithm. To measure the robustness of using the proposed network architecture, under the same attack condition, an invulnerability analysis is performed. After conducting simulation experiments, the results show that the proposed scheme greatly improves communication security and protection.

TI Bisphosphine-Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters with the Crown/Birdcage-Shaped
   Au11 Cores: Structures and Optical Properties
SO INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB To estimate the effect of bisphosphine ligands on the formation of the isomeric core structures of gold nanoclusters, the different ligation of bisphosphine ligands is usually used to participate in the construction of gold nanoclusters. Here, the selection of the different bisphosphine ligands, DPEphos and Xantphos, is performed to construct two novel gold nanoclusters, [Au-11(DPEphos)(4)Cl-2]Cl (1) and [Au-11(Xantphos)(4)Cl-2]Cl(2), which have been characterized by IR, H-1 and P-31 NMR, ESI-MS, XRD, SEM, XPS, TG, UV-vis, and X-ray crystal structure analysis. The structural analyses indicate that the ligation of bisphosphine ligands play a crucial role in the formation of the fascinating Au-11 cores: gold nanocluster 1 includes a birdcage-shaped Au-11 core with eight electrons, while gold nanocluster 2 contains a crown-shaped Au-11 core with eight electrons. Meanwhile, DOS and PDOS studies indicate that the Au-11 cores have a strong effect on the composition of HOMO and LUMO orbitals of gold nanoclusters. Furthermore, the different Au-11 core structures lead to different optical absorption characteristics (1: 456 nm; 2: 427 nm). All these demonstrate that the ligation of bisphosphine ligands may have an important influence on constructing the stability of the isomeric core structures of gold nanoclusters.

AB Lead-free perovskite dielectric materials for capacitors have received wide concern in recent years, but their energy storage density and efficiency still cannot meet the growing application demand for practical applications. In this work, we prepared a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramic of (1-x)Bi0.47Na0.47Ba0.06TiO3-xSr (Zr0.8Nb0.16)O-3, which was synthesized via a normal solid-state route. The microstructure, dielectric properties and energy storage behavior of the ceramics were explored. The ceramics can be well sintered and situated in the region where rhombohedral and tetragonal phases coexist. The addition of Sr(Zr0.8Nb0.16)O-3 (SZN) significantly extends the dielectric-temperature plateau between T-s and T-m and reduces the remnant polarization P-r, but the large saturation polarization P-s is still maintained. Besides, the doping of SZN enhances the relaxation of the material and increases the dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) from 50 kV/cm (x = 0) to 100 kV/cm (x = 0.04 and 0.06). Therefore, the ceramic with x = 0.06 exhibits a high discharging efficiency (eta) of 71.1% and energy density (W) of 1.56 J/cm(3) at 100 kV/cm and shows the superior thermal stability with the changes in recoverable energy density (W-rec) and. of less than 10% and 30% at the temperature range of 25-180 degrees C and the excellent frequency stability with the variations of Wrec and. of less than 1.8% and 1% at the frequency range of 10 Hz-100 Hz.

AB This paper addresses the stability issue of a class of delayed switched cascade nonlinear systems consisting of separate subsystems and coupling terms between them. Some global and local asymptotic stability sufficient conditions are proposed, drawing stability conclusion of the overall cascade system from those of separate systems. These results essentially rely on the following observation: For a general delayed switched nonlinear system being asymptotically stable, the trajectories of the perturbed system asymptotically approach zero if so does the perturbation. This observation is one of the main results in this paper.

AB Nitrogen is an essential element and 80% of nitrogen fixation from atmosphere is achieved by biological nitrogen fixation. When graphene enters the environment, it would inevitably interact with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and might disturb the nitrogen cycle. Herein, the interaction between graphene oxide (GO) and nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter chroococcum was studied to reveal the potential impact of graphene materials on biological nitrogen fixation. After incubation with A. chroococcum, GO was separated, washed and characterized by different techniques. The toxicity of GO to A. chroococcum was monitored by colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, growth curve, live/dead staining and ultrastructural observations. The nitrogen fixation activity of A. chroococcum was measured by acetylene reduction assay and the soil nitrogen contents were measured. GO was immediately reduced by cell secretions and kept stable thereafter. GO stimulated A. chroococcum growth at low concentrations and showed inhibitive effect at high concentrations. GO induced cell death and cell wall break at high concentration. The toxicological mechanism was assigned to membrane damage and oxidative stress. In the presence of soil, GO showed similar concentration-dependent but alleviated toxicity, while the soil nitrogen contents slightly increased at high concentrations. Our results collectively indicated that GO was bio-reduced and toxic to nitrogen-fixation bacteria. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a TiO2 thin layer is deliberately inserted in the Pt-Ag/SiO2 :Ag/p(++)-Si memristor to achieve enhanced resistive switching performance in terms of retention and cyclic endurance characteristics. The memristor device exhibits a bidirectional analog switching behavior corresponding to a wide dynamic range of synaptic weight modulation as potentiation and depression under the consecutive positive or negative DC bias sweeps and pulse trains. Moreover, the learning and memory functions, including paired-pulse facilitation and pulse repetition-induced short-term memory to long-term memory transition, are also demonstrated. The relation of the memory stability to the repeated input pulse stimulus and the device conductance with time have also been revealed by the stretched exponential relaxation model. It is shown that the conductance of our newly fabricated Pt-Ag/SiO2:Ag/TiO2/p(++)-Si memristor device can be modulated by successive Ag-filament growth and dissolution in the SiO2:Ag/TiO2 bilayer oxide structure, which is essential for potential applications in memory devices and artificial neural systems.

AB Gold-based nanomaterials of various sizes and geometries have been prepared for use as photothermal agents due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Here we report a simple one-step synthesis of gold nanoworms (NWs) and characterized them with transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that small gold nanounits were first formed by reducing chloroaurate ions (AuCl4-) with sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and then fused together to form NWs assisted by dopamine (DA), which served a structure-director due to an oriented attachment mechanism. Then DA in the solution was further polymerized into polydopamine (PDA) to form a coating layer on the surface of gold NWs. Moreover, further experiments showed that gold NWs had low cytotoxicity and excellent performance as a photothermal bactericidal on both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. These results show that the synthesized gold NWs are a promising photothermal agent (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In order to obtain excellent electrical properties and its temperature stability of KNN-based ceramics to meet the practical applications, a new lead-free material system of (1-x)K0.5Na0.5Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-xBi(0.5)Na(0.5)Zr(0.8)Sn(0.2)O(3) (KNNS-xBNZS, 0 <= x <= 0.060) was designed, and the enhanced electrical properties (eg, d(33) similar to 465 pC/N, epsilon(r) similar to 3318, S-uni similar to 0.133%) is obtained in the ceramics with x = 0.04. The physical origin of enhanced electric properties should be ascribed to the phase instability of R-T, resulting in a low-energy barrier, which can greatly facilitate the polarization switching. Moreover, the temperature stable of piezoelectric constant (d(33) or d(33)*) is measured by three distinctive methods in different phase boundaries (O, O-T, R-T) at the temperature range 20 degrees C-180 degrees C, revealing that the O-T phase boundary has a relatively good temperature stability. A mode is used to show how to effectively modified the piezoelectric constant (d(33) or d(33)*) and its temperature stability, we believe that such a strategy may further improve the temperature stability of d(33) or d(33)* value in KNN-based ceramics.

AB PurposeGrazing exclusion by fencing has been widely used for restoring degraded alpine grasslands, but rarely studies have considered the altitudinal difference of grazing exclusion effects on vegetation characteristics and soil properties. In this study, we focused our attention mainly on how alpine grasslands at different altitudes will response to long-term grazing exclusion.Materials and methodsA 10-year altitudinal grazing exclusion experiment was conducted along a large altitudinal gradient (six altitudes, from 4400 to 5100m) in alpine meadows on the central Tibetan Plateau. The vegetation characteristics and soil properties across grazing exclusion plots and free grazing plots were observed at each of six altitudes.Results and discussionAbove-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) showed a unimodal pattern along the altitudinal gradient from 4400 to 5100m. A similar altitudinal pattern was found in sedges biomass but not in that of grasses, legumes, and herbs. Grazing exclusion practice increased vegetation cover, plant height, AGB, BGB, STN, SOC but has no significant effect on community diversity. Grazing did not alter the altitudinal patterns of AGB, BGB, SOC, and STN, but the stimulation impacts of grazing exclusion on these factors decreased with increasing altitude. The relative changes of MBC and MBN after grazing exclusion were significant related with that of BGB.ConclusionsOur study indicates that grazing exclusion by fencing is effective to restore vegetation and improve soil carbon and nitrogen properties in overgrazed alpine grasslands. However, the stimulation effects of grazing exclusion on alpine grasslands decreased with increasing altitudes. We suggest that in the high-altitude grassland ecosystems, especially where environment is harsh and stocking rate is relative low, grazing exclusion might not be efficient enough for restoring degraded grasslands.

TI Intrusion Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks with an Improved NSA
   Based on Space Division
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
AB Inspired by the biological immune system, many researchers apply artificial immune principles to intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks, such as negative selection algorithms, danger theory, and dendritic cell algorithms. When applying the negative selection algorithm to wireless sensor networks, the characteristics of wireless sensor networks, such as frequent changes in network topology and limited resources, are not considered too much, which makes the detection effect to need improvement. In this paper, a negative selection algorithm based on spatial partition is proposed and applied to hierarchical wireless sensor networks. The algorithm first analyzes the distribution of self-set in the real-valued space then divides the real-valued space, and several subspaces are obtained. Selves are filled into different subspaces. We implement the negative selection algorithm in the subspace. The randomly generated candidate detector only needs to be tolerated with selves in the subspace where the detector is located, not all the selves. This operation reduces the time cost of distance calculation. In the detection process of detectors, the antigen which is to be detected only needs to match the mature detectors in the subspace where the antigen is located, rather than all the detectors. This operation speeds up the antigen detection process. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the algorithm has better time efficiency and quality of detectors, saves sensor node resources and reduces the energy consumption, and is an effective algorithm for wireless sensor network intrusion detection.

AB Molecular docking, which mainly includes pose prediction and binding affinity calculation, has become an important tool for assisting structure-based drug design. Correctly predicting the ligand binding pose to a protein target enables the estimation of binding free energy using various tools. Previous studies have shown that the consensus method can be used to improve the docking performance with respect to compound scoring and pose prediction. In this report, a novel consensus docking strategy was proposed, which uses a dynamic benchmark data set selection to determine the best program combinations to improve the docking success rate. Using the complexes from PDBbind as a benchmark data set, a 4.9% enhancement in success rate was achieved compared with the best program.

ID OIL
AB China, as a non-Mediterranean country with non-Mediterranean climate, is taking olive cultivation as an important part of its agricultural development. In order to highlight some important facts about the history, status, distribution, and trends of the olive industry in China, we performed analyses based on Internet databases, online GIS software, and scientific papers. Results show that the olive industries have been concentrated in several key areas in Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Hubei. However, the business scope of olive enterprises is still narrow, the scale of enterprises is generally small, and individual or family management of farmers plays an important role. Thus, increased investment and policies are needed to enhance their capacities of R&D and production, and Chinese investigators should carry out socio-economic studies at the microcosmic level and take the initiative to innovate the products by cooperating with people in the same professions worldwide.

AB The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation during invitro maturation (IVM) on the developmental capacity of yak (Bos grunniens) oocytes. Nuclear maturation, DNA integrity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, subsequent embryonic development, and gene expression after invitro fertilization (IVF) were evaluated. The Se concentrations in yak plasma and follicular fluid were 0.142 and 0.069 mu g/mL, respectively. The DNA damage in cumulus cells decreased significantly with 2 and 4 mu g/mL supplementation of sodium selenite to IVM medium (P < 0.05). Total GSH-Px activity in oocytes increased in all Se supplementation groups, and the 2 and 4 mu g/mL groups were significantly higher than the control group (0 mu g/mL). However, the cleavage rate was not significantly different after Se supplementation (P > 0.05). The IVF blastocyst formation rates of 0, 1 and 4 mu g/mL sodium selenite groups were 47.7%, 51.2% and 58.9%, respectively. The 2 mu g/mL sodium selenite group had the highest blastocyst formation rate (60.5%). Gene expression analysis revealed that the quantity of transcripts associated with selenoprotein and protein synthesis were high in the 2 and 4 mu g/mL groups. In conclusion, both GSH-Px activity of oocytes and DNA integrity of cumulus cells significantly increased with supplemental Se during oocyte IVM. Considering that embryonic development is responsive to Se supplementation, we inferred that appropriate Se concentrations during IVM were beneficial for yak oocyte maturation and subsequent development.

AB This paper addresses the dynamic properties of a class of continuous-time switched nonlinear systems with perturbations and delays. With the assumption that the nominal system is exponentially stable, it is shown that the trajectory of the perturbed system exponentially decays to or asymptotically approaches origin provided that the perturbation exponentially decays to or asymptotically approaches origin. These properties are then applied to cascade systems for their stability analysis. It is proven that a delayed switched nonlinear cascade system is exponentially stable if and only if all subsystems obtained from the cascade system by deleting the coupling terms are exponentially stable. A sufficient condition ensuring asymptotic stability of a cascade system is also proposed. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Mount Wuyi area of northern Fujian Province, China, is famous for having produced superior teas for over 1500 years, including rock tea, which is the focus of this article. Locals evaluate sites in the mountain area in terms of the material quality of their tea plants and tea. The skills and techniques of specialist tea workers, and not just the terrain, are also regarded as essential in producing quality teas. These two elements, human skill and environment, have combined over time as embodied cultural knowledge, including a special vocabulary to judge the taste and fragrance of teas. Recent government attempts to set up a national tea quality standard for commercial purposes, emphasizing human skill and technique over felicitous environment, have had to accommodate the cultural importance of the traditional embodied knowledge of the ecology and hierarchy of tea appreciation.

AB This paper addresses the stability issue of discrete-time switched systems with guaranteed dwell-time. The approach of switched homogeneous Lyapunov function of higher order is formally proposed. By means of this approach, a necessary and sufficient condition is established to check the exponential stability of the considered system. With the observation that switching signal is actually arbitrary if the dwell time is one sample time, a necessary and sufficient condition is also presented to verify the exponential stability of switched systems under arbitrary switching signals. Using the augmented argument, a necessary and sufficient exponential stability criterion is given for discrete-time switched systems with delays. A numerical example is provided to show the advantages of the theoretical results.

AB The traditional Fenton system (Fe2+-H2O2) only works in an acidic environment and produces a large quantity of sludge. In this study, we reported that a Fe3O4/SiO2/C nanocomposite (FSCNC) could be used as a high-performance Fenton-like catalyst for the decoloration of methylene blue (MB). To prepare FSCNC, SiO2 was precipitated on Fe3O4 cores by the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate, and the deposition of carbon was via the hydrothermal dehydrogenation of glucose. FSCNC showed much higher catalytic activity than naked Fe3O4 at a neutral pH of 7.5. Efficient decoloration of MB was achieved within 15 min in the FSCNC-H2O2 system. The FSCNC-H2O2 system worked well in the pH range of 3.5-9.5 and showed good resistance to radical scavengers tertiary butanol and ethanol. Higher H2O2 concentration and temperature were preferred to achieve faster kinetics. The regeneration of FSCNC was easily achieved by washing the catalyst and about 70% of the initial activity was retained after 8 cycles. The implication to the future applications of FSCNC as a Fenton-like catalyst is discussed.

AB The yak (Bos grunniens) is an iconic symbol in the high-altitude region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks, resulting in major economic losses. To investigate the diversity of viral species, we reported the metagenomics-derived virome in a pooled faecal sample of 20 diarrhoeic yaks. The nine viruses found in the pooled diarrhoeic samples, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, were influenza A virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), rotavirus, ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (bovine hokovirus), astrovirus (AstV), bovine enterovirus, hepatitis E virus, kobuvirus and woodchuck hepatitis virus. Compared with healthy yaks, only AstV had a significantly higher prevalence rate in diarrhoeal samples, indicating a correlation with the clinical symptoms of diarrhoea in yaks. To further investigate the molecular characterization of yak AstV, a near-full genome was obtained from a diarrhoeic sample. It was 6243 bp in length and shared 46.4-66.2 % similarity with other related bovine AstVs from faeces. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome demonstrated that the yak AstV fell within the bovine AstVs cluster, but was located in a unique lineage, suggesting a novel AstV species was identified in yaks. Interestingly, the ORF2 region of yak AstV had closer similarity and genetically relationship with deer AstV strain CcAstV-2 than that of the bovine AstVs. Further analysis showed that one possible interspecies recombination event occurred in ORF2. In summary, this study expanded our understanding of the viral communities of diarrhoeal yaks and identified a novel AstV that was associated with diarrhoea in yaks.

AB In the present study, the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus casei Qian (LC-Qian), the key microorganism in Tibetan yak yoghurt, on activated carbon-induced constipation were determined in vivo. ICR mice were treated with LC-Qian for nine days by oral administration. The body weight, defecation status, gastrointestinal transit and defecation time of mice were assessed, and the serum levels of motilin (MTL), gastrin (Gas), endothelin (ET), somatostatin (SS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were further evaluated. Bisacodyl was used as the positive control. The time until the first black stool defecation following carbon intake of the normal, control, 100 mg/kg bisacodyl-treated, Lactobacillus bulgaricus (LB)-treated, LC-Qian (L)- and LC-Qian (H)-treated mice was 93, 231, 121, 194, 172 and 157 min, respectively. Following treatment with LC-Qian, the gastrointestinal transit was increased to 52.4% [LC-Qian (L)] and 65.8% [LC-Qian (H)], while that in the group treated with the common lactic acid bacteria of LB was 40.3%. The MTL, Gas, ET, AChE, SP and VIP serum levels were significantly increased and levels of SS were reduced in mice following LC-Qian treatment compared with those in the control mice (P<0.05). Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that LC-Qian raised the c-Kit, GDNF as well as SCF mRNA expression levels and reduced the TRPV1 and NOS expression levels in tissue of the small intestine in mice. These results suggested that lactic acid bacteria prevent constipation in mice, among which LC-Qian was the most effective.

AB As sustainable materials, cellulose-based materials have attracted significant attention in the field of environmental protection, resulting in the publication of numerous academic papers. However, there is a scarcity of literature that involving scientometric analysis within this specific domain. This review aims to address this gap and highlight recent research in this field by utilizing scientometric analysis and a historical review. As a result, 21 highly cited articles and 10 mostly productive journals were selected out. The scientometric analysis reveals that recent studies were objectively clustered into five interconnected main themes: extraction of cellulose from raw materials and its degradation, adsorption of pollutants using cellulose-based materials, cellulose-acetatebased membrane materials, nanocellulose-based materials, and other cellulose-based materials such as carboxymethyl cellulose and bacterial cellulose for environmental protection.

DE Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP); Hydrogel; Wound repair
AB Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that demonstrates notable biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additionally, BSP possesses therapeutic attributes, including anti-inflammatory and reparative actions. Herein, we report a novel BSP hydrogel prepared using 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) as a cross-linking agent. The hydrogel was synthesized via condensation of the hydroxyl group in the BSP molecule with the epoxy group in BDDE. This technique of preparation preserves BSP's natural properties while avoiding any potentially hazardous or adverse effects that may occur during the chemical alteration. Compared with BSP before crosslinking, BSP hydrogel has distinct advantages, such as a three-dimensional network structure, improved water retention, enhanced swelling capacity, greater thermal stability, and superior mechanical properties. Experiments on in vitro cytotoxicity, hemolysis, and degradation revealed that BSP hydrogel had good biocompatibility and biodegradability. Finally, we evaluated the in vivo wound repair effect of BSP hydrogel, and the results showed that BSP hydrogel had a significant wound-healing effect. Furthermore, the BSP hydrogel promoted the polarization of M1-type macrophages towards the M2-type and reduced the inflammatory response during the wound healing phase. Because of its ease of production, safety, efficacy, and environmental friendliness, BSP hydrogel is considered a highly promising material for wound dressings.

AB The effects of natural fermentation and inoculation fermentation on the volatile flavor substances of pickled ginger was studied. High-throughput sequencing and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry were used to measure the bacterial community changes and its flavour compounds during one to six days' fermentation. First, 55 and 51 volatile compounds were detected in the natural and the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum-inoculated fermentation samples, respectively. Alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes and esters were the main volatile components of both types of fermented ginger, but their contents were different. Then, 40 and 43 bacterial genera were detected in the natural and inoculation fermented gingers, respectively, including 15 major bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus. However, the abundance of bacterial genera in the samples was different. The correlation analysis showed that a total of 43 bacterial genera had medium to high correlations with 49 volatile flavor compounds (|?|> 0.6), including one aldehyde, two ketones, five esters, nine alcohols and 32 olefins. The comprehensive results showed that, compared with natural fermentation, inoculation fermentation could change the abundance of bacteria in pickled ginger, thereby improving the volatile flavor compounds of this popular product.

AB Livestock grazing can alter biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, how long-term and continuous grazing intensity affect belowground biodiversity remains unclear, especially for soil microbial diversity. Here, through a well-controlled 5-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow, the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities to yak grazing intensity were examined. Our results showed that grazing intensity signifi-cantly changed soil bacterial and fungal community compositions, rather than microbial alpha-diversity. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated that both soil bacterial and fungal network complexity gradually decreased with increasing grazing intensities. Meanwhile, soil C/N ratio, soil moisture, dissolved organic ni-trogen (DON), NH4+-N, and aboveground biomass (AGB) were related to soil bacterial community, and AGB, NO3-- N, NH4+-N, and DON and were associated with soil fungal community. Taken together, our manipulative experiment provides empirical evidence that grazing intensity-induced alterations of aboveground vegetation and nitrogen availability primarily trigger the shift of soil microbial community and structure. These results can support grassland management and ecological restoration in alpine ecosystems.

AB Skeletal muscle is the most extensive tissue in mammals, and they perform several functions; it is derived from paraxial mesodermal somites and undergoes hyperplasia and hypertrophy to form multinucleated, contractile, and functional muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle is a complex heterogeneous tissue composed of various cell types that establish communication strategies to exchange biological information; therefore, characterizing the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional signatures of skeletal muscle is central to understanding its ontogeny's details. Studies of skeletal myogenesis have focused primarily on myogenic cells' proliferation, differentiation, migration, and fusion and ignored the intricate network of cells with specific biological functions. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology has recently enabled the exploration of skeletal muscle cell types and molecular events during development. This review summarizes the progress in single-cell RNA sequencing and its applications in skeletal myogenesis, which will provide insights into skeletal muscle pathophysiology.

AB Liver disease has become a major global health and economic burden due to its broad spectrum of diseases, multiple causes and difficult treatment. Most liver diseases progress to end-stage liver disease, which has a large amount of matrix deposition that makes it difficult for the liver and hepatocytes to regenerate. Liver transplantation is the only treatment for end-stage liver disease, but the shortage of suitable organs, expensive treatment costs and surgical complications greatly reduce patient survival rates. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective treatment modality. Cell-free therapy has become a research hotspot in the field of regenerative medicine. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have regulatory properties and transport functional "cargo" through physiological barriers to target cells to exert communication and regulatory activities. These exosomes also have little tumorigenic risk. MSC-derived exosomes promote hepatocyte proliferation and repair damaged liver tissue by participating in intercellular communication and regulating signal transduction, which supports their promise as a new strategy for the treatment of liver diseases. This paper reviews the physiological functions of exosomes and highlights the physiological changes and alterations in signaling pathways related to MSC-derived exosomes for the treatment of liver diseases in some relevant clinical studies. We also summarize the advantages of exosomes as drug delivery vehicles and discuss the challenges of exosome treatment of liver diseases in the future.

AB Dispositional optimism (hereinafter, optimism), as a vital character strength, reflects the tendency to hold gen-eralized positive expectancies for future outcomes. A great number of studies have consistently shown the im-portance of optimism to a spectrum of physical and mental health outcomes. However, less attention has been given to the intrinsic neurodevelopmental patterns associated with interindividual differences in optimism. Here, we investigated this important question in a large sample comprising 231 healthy adolescents (16-20 years old) via structural magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral tests. We constructed individual structural covariance networks based on cortical gyrification using a recent novel approach combining probability density estimation and Kullback-Leibler divergence and estimated global (global efficiency, local efficiency and small-worldness) and regional (betweenness centrality) properties of these constructed networks using graph theoretical analysis. Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex and estimated total intracranial volume showed that optimism was pos-itively related to global and local efficiency but not small-worldness. Partial least squares correlations indicated that optimism was positively linked to a pronounced betweenness centrality pattern, in which twelve cognition-, emotion-, and motivation-related regions made robust and reliable contributions. These findings remained basi-cally consistent after additionally controlling for family socioeconomic status and showed significant correlations with optimism scores from 2.5 years before, which replicated the main findings. The current work, for the first time, delineated characteristics of the cortical gyrification covariance network associated with optimism, extend-ing previous neurobiological understandings of optimism, which may navigate the development of interventions on a neural network level aimed at raising optimism.

AB Precipitation and temperature are major controls on multiple ecosystem functions in alpine grasslands. There is scant evidence for the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in alpine meadows. To explore the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation changes on the EMF in alpine meadows, we transplanted meadow blocks reciprocally among three altitudes (4,650, 4,950, and 5,200 m) on the central Tibetan Plateau. Compared with the home sites (control), the EMF has a trend to increase when meadow blocks were downward transplanted (experimental warming) to the high-precipitation sites but decrease as meadow blocks were downward transplanted to the low-precipitation sites. However, the experimental cooling (upward transplantation) consistently reduced the EMF regardless of the precipitation change. The increase of EMF under the experimental warming was closely related to the variation of both plant and soil functions, whereas the reduction of EMF under the cooling was highly correlated with the decrease of plant function. Our results highlight that climate warming effects on the EMF are greatly associated with precipitation changes in the semi-arid alpine ecosystems.

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with fantastic properties have found important applications in various areas. Learning the lessons from plastics and microplastics, it is urgent to investigate the environmental impacts of emerging materials to avoid potential pollution. However, the environmental toxicity and risks of MOF materials are seldom reported. Herein, we studied the toxicity and activity inhibition of MOF-199 to nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. MOF-199 significantly suppressed the growth of A. vinelandii and led to cell death at 40 mg/L. MOF-199 penetrated the cell wall and induced the shrinking of bacterial cells. MOF-199 reduced the nitrogen fixation activity of A. vinelandii at 40 mg/L by decreasing the gene nifH levels and inhibiting the Ca2+Mg2+-ATPase activity, which was further confirmed by the changes in oxidative phosphorylation related genes. Complete growth inhibition and activity loss of A. vinelandii occurred at 60 mg/L of MOF-199. The toxicological mechanism of MOF-199 to A. vinelandii was assigned to the oxidative stress, which occurred at 20 mg/L and higher. Both Cu2+ release and particulates themselves contributed to the toxicity of MOF-199 to A. vinelandii. These findings highlighted the environmental hazards and risks of MOF materials to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitrogen fixation in the biogeochemical cycle.

AB Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal malignancy. Its prevalence rate remains low but continues to grow each year. Among all stages of PC, metastatic PC is defined as late-stage (stage IV) PC and has an even higher fatality rate. Patients with PC do not have any specific clinical manifestations. Most cases are inoperable at the time-point of diagnosis. Prognosis is also poor even with curative-intent surgery. Complications during surgery, postoperative pancreatic fistula and recurrence with metastatic foci make the management of metastatic PC difficult. While extensive efforts were made to improve survival outcomes, further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis poses a formidable challenge. The present review provided an overview of the mechanisms of metastatic PC, summarizing currently known signaling pathways (e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NF-kappa B and KRAS), imaging that may be utilized for early detection and biomarkers (e.g. carbohydrate antigen 19-9, prostate cancer-associated transcript-1, F-box/LRR-repeat protein 7 and tumor stroma), giving insight into promising therapeutic targets.

AB Geodiversity incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered determinants of biodiversity. However, research on the spatial relations between geodiversity and biodiversity at large regional scales is challenging because estimating biodiversity from field data is usually time consuming and costly. Satellite image textural measures and landscape metrics have been reported as powerful tools and proxies to characterize regional biodiversity. The goal of this study is to explore the spatiotemporal variations in two different biodiversity proxies and their spatial relations with geodiversity in Loess Plateau, China. Geographically-weighted spatial correlation was used to characterize the non-stationary spatial relations between geodiversity and the two proxy measures. The results showed that textural measures and landscape metrics exhibit different features of the spatiotemporal variations, highlighting their complementarity and consequent relevance in conjoint application. Trend analysis of the textural measures during 2000-2015 indicated that habitat heterogeneity increased in most of the region (39.87-62.41%), particularly in the central and southwestern areas. Nonetheless, the landscape metrics decreased in the central and southwestern region (38.14-71.94%), particularly in the Ziwuling and Huanglong forest area and part of Gansu province. The magnitude and direction of the relations between geodiversity and the two biodiversity proxies were context-dependent and varied spatially. Despite the contrasting direction in the relations between geodiversity and textural measures/landscape metrics in the southeastern region, stronger relations indicated by greater absolute value of the correlation coefficient were found in human-dominated areas than those in other areas. Informed by these results, we recommend focusing primarily on the humandominated landscapes and the areas with high geodiversity to promote conservation planning with geodiversity and biodiversity as equal, interrelated concepts.

AB Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an important pathogen of cats that has two genogroups (GI and GII). To investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of FCVs in southwestern China, 162 nasal swab samples were collected from cats in animal shelters and pet hospitals. In total, 38 of the clinical samples (23.46%) were identified as FCV positive using nested RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses using 10 capsid protein VP1 sequences revealed that 8 GI and 2 GII strains formed two independent clusters. Additionally, three separated FCVs that were not clustered phylogenetically (two GI and one GII strains) were successfully isolated from clinical samples and their full-length genomes were obtained. Phylogenetic and recombinant analyses of a GI FCV revealed genomic breakpoints in ORF1 and ORF2 regions with evidence for recombinant events between GI sub-genogroups, which is reported in China for the first time. Furthermore, sera obtained from mice immunized independently with the three FCV isolates and a commercial vaccine were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies. The three separate FCVs were neutralized by each other at a 1:19 to 1:775 titer range, whereas the triple-inactivated vaccine was at a titer of 1:16, which suggested that different genogroup/sub-genogroup FCV strains exhibit significantly different titers of neutralizing antibodies, including the commercial FCV vaccine. Thus, our study revealed the genetic diversity and complex cross-reactivity levels of FCVs in southwestern China, which provides new insights for application in vaccination strategies.

AB Heterogeneous Pd nanocatalysts are efficient catalysts for the Heck reaction but require multi-step, sophisticated procedures and harsh reaction conditions. In this work, a green and facile strategy has been developed to decorate Pd nanoparticles on polydopamine (PDA)-coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pd/CNTs-PDA) via a one-pot method. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques including transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which proved that Pd NPs are well-dispersed on the PDA and between the surfaces of the PDA and CNTs. The resultant Pd/CNTs-PDA catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic reactivity toward the Heck reaction at low temperatures. Moreover, by DFT simulation, we found that during the PDA polymerization process, a large number of unsaturated -N= and C=O species are more active than the groups on the PDA end product to anchor Pd NPs. The results provide evidence that the catalyst synthesized by the onepot method exhibited good activity because sufficient active sites could be created to effectively promote Pd NPs dispersion during the dopamine polymerization process. Additionally, the Pd/CNTs-PDA catalyst was successfully employed in Heck cross-coupling reactions with various functionalized substrates. This method opens a window for the fabrication of high-performance nanocomposite catalysts under mild conditions using simple methods and has several potential applications.

AB Although the multiphase coexistence has made great achievements in improving the piezoelectric properties of barium titanate-based (BT) ceramics, the problems such as internal lattice distortion and external physical mechanism at the phase boundary still remain. Here, we have studied the phase structure, atomic parameters and domain structure of (1-x)BaTiO3-xCaZrO(3) (abbreviated as BT-xCZ) ceramics. By regulating the phase transition temperatures, the rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (RO-T) multiphase coexistence (x 1/4 0.06) is realized at room temperature. Notably, high piezoelectric constant of d(33) similar to 445 +/- 20 pC/N and large electromechanical coupling factor of kp 1/4 55% are obtained at x 1/4 0.06. With the doping of CaZrO3 (CZ), the lattice of ceramics is distorted, thereby increasing the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. Importantly, the domain structure of BT-xCZ ceramics observed by the acid etching technology further proves that the high piezoelectricity is attributed to the multiphase coexistence and reduction of the domain wall energy density.

AB Food contamination caused by microorganisms has become a threat to consumers' health. Exploring antagonistic endophytes from plants of food raw-material and applying bioactive metabolites to inhibit the contamination has been an alternative and safer solution. In this study, we isolated and screened potential antagonistic endophytes from fresh Camellia assamica leaves, which were widely used in tea beverage production. We focused on a strain that showed visible inhibitory activity to Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It was identified as a member of Bacillus velezensis and named FZ06. The results of genome analysis showed the strain FZ06 had 167 single-copy specific genes, much higher than those of most related strains. Also, 11 potential gene clusters of antimicrobial metabolites were found. Three groups of lipopeptides (surfactin, iturin, and fengycin) were identified by UPLC-MS/MS in purified antimicrobial methanol fraction of strain FZ06. The results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test proved the lipopeptide extract showed significant inhibitory effect on food spoilage bacteria (MIC 512-2048 mu g/mL) and toxigenic fungi (MIC 128-256 mu g/mL). In conclusion, this study suggests that the endophytic B. velezensis FZ06 and its lipopeptide extract hold great potential applications in the inhibition of food spoilage bacteria and toxic fungi in food industry.

AB Wireless body area networks (WBANs) is a critical research focus at present, providing a reliable and smart healthcare system to monitor the physical condition of the patient. Only the authorized user can access the WBANs since the collected data is very personal and sensitive. In this paper, we present a certificateless signcryption scheme based on RSA and then design an efficient data access control scheme for WBANs using the proposed signcryption scheme. The system does not have the certificate management and the key escrow problems. The most striking one is that it is based only on the widely used RSA cryptosystem without the bilinear pairing, which is advantageous to its realization in industry. The analysis shows that the scheme is secure in the random oracle model and simultaneously satisfies confidentiality, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and public ciphertext verification. Besides, it has reasonable computational and communication costs. To our knowledge, this is the first certificateless signcryption scheme based on RSA to date.

AB Renewable energy is playing an increasingly important role in energy security and environmental protection. As China has a huge demand for renewable energy and also has abundant wind resources, it is vital that government, investors and operators work together to ensure the sustainable development of the wind energy industry. Even though China is already a leader in wind power generation with the largest installed wind power capacity in the world, it has continued to build new wind power facilities. However, due to industrial immaturity and the need for significant investment, wind power investors and operators are faced with uncertainty about the attendant risks. To achieve risk mitigation and sustainability, this paper proposes an investment risk evaluation and optimization process for Chinese wind power projects. The Monte Carlo method is first used to evaluate the investment risks, after which a multi-objective programming model is built for the optimization. A specific case in western China is examined to demonstrate the proposed methodology, with the evaluation results indicating that the project has high investment risk. Based on the case study, the key risk factors are identified and optimization suggestions given for China's wind power projects. The proposed methodology and findings contribute to research on the planning, investment and sustainable operation of renewable energy power generation projects in other areas in China.

AB To further improve the properties of KNN-based lead-free ceramics, a new ceramic system, (0.98-x) K0.525Na0.475Nb0.965Sb0.035O3 -0 02 BaZr0.5Hf0.5O3-x(Bi0.5Na0.5)ZrO3 (KNNS-BZH-xBNZ) was designed, the relevant properties such as piezoelectricity, strain, and temperature stability were analysed in detail. It was found that the R-T phase boundary can be successfully constructed when x=0.030, and this two-phase coexistence shows relatively good comprehensive properties (d(33)similar to 410 pC/N, T-c similar to 255 degrees C, S-uni similar to 0.132%, and d(33)*similar to 441 pm/V). Meanwhile, its strain property also shows good temperature stability from room temperature to 180 degrees C (S-uni100 degrees C/S-uniRT similar to 97.5 % and S-uni180 degrees C/S-uniRT similar to 83.9%), which is comparatively superior to many KNN-based ceramics and some lead-based ceramics. Therefore, KNNS-BZH-xBNZ ceramics may broaden the practical application of lead-free ceramics.

AB The bamboo shoot of Pleioblastus amarus (Keng) Keng f. is a medicinal and edible plant product in China. In this study, the chemical composition of the total alkaloids from bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot shells of P. amarus (Keng) Keng f. (ABSP and ABSSP, respectively) were separated and investigated by UHPLC/QTOF-MS/MS. The results showed that a total of 32 alkaloids were extracted, with 15 common to both ABSP and ABSSP and 10 and 7 alkaloids distinct to ABSP and ABSSP, respectively. ABSP and ABSSP both decreased the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 mu g/mL)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 murine macrophages with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 78 and 55 mu g/mL, respectively. We also found that ABSP and ABSSP (100 mu g/mL) could decrease the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at both mRNA and protein levels in LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, 100 mu g/mL of ABSP and ABSSP also significantly inhibited LPS-induced mRNA expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Additionally, ABSP and ABSSP (100 mu g/mL) decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Collectively, the total alkaloids from the bamboo shoots and shells of P. amarus exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells through the inhibition of ERK signaling. This result can provide support for the medicinal use and further study of P. amarus.

AB Fermented milks were prepared with various culture combinations of Lactobacillus plantarum or Bifidobacterium animalis with Streptococcus thermophilus, and the impact of microbes combinations on acidification, proteolysis, lipolysis, texture, volatiles and sensory quality of fermented milk was investigated during 21-day storage at 4 degrees C. The results showed that products from the co-cultures displayed higher titratable acidity, more peptides, higher proteolytic activity and lipolysis capacity compared with that from the pure strains of S. thermophilus. When L. plantarum and B. animalis combined in a ratio of 2:1 with S. thermophilus, the products maintained relatively more viable cell counts of the 3 strains, strong proteolysis ability and lipolysis capacity during the storage. Milk fermented by co-cultures of the 3 strains exhibited higher cohesiveness, more volatiles and better sensory quality compared with these fermented by S. thermophilus only or in co-cultures with either B. animalis or L. plantarum based on principal component analysis.

Five derivatives A2, A3, A4, B1 and B9 exhibit excellent in vitro activity (MIC: < 0.035 mu M) against the drug susceptive Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain and two clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strains, and acceptable PK properties. Compound B1 bearing a cyclohexylmethyl piperazine moiety, the same side chain of PBTZ169, was found to have obviously greater AUC(0-infinity) and C-max Q203 and PBTZ169, suggesting its promising potential to be a lead compound for future antitubercular drug discovery.

AB We investigated in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei YBJ01 (LPSP-YBJ01) isolated and identified from fermented yogurt. Strain LPSP-YBJ01 had stress tolerance against acidity, bile salt, and osmotic pressure. Five in vitro antioxidant assays were used to evaluate antioxidant activity of LPSP-YBJ01, which could scavenge free radicals (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and hydroxyl) and superoxide anion in vitro. In addition, strain LPSP-YBJ01 had stronger antilipid peroxidation activity and weak reducing power in vitro. We measured in vivo antioxidant activity of LPSP-YBJ01 in an oxidation mouse model induced by D-galactose injection. Strain LPSP-YBJ01 significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and total-antioxidant capability, and inhibited generation of malondialdehyde in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, strain LPSP-YBJ01 also increased the hepatic and splenic protein expressions of some antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD in mice treated with D-galactose. Thus, LPSP-YBJ01 had antioxidant activity in vitro and in vivo and may be a useful probiotic.

AB In this study, a novel circular replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single stranded (CRESS) DNA virus was discovered in diarrheic sample of a calf with severe hemorrhagic enteritis. The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circolike virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the virus infection and diarrhea.

AB This paper aims to provide a novel metaheuristic algorithm motivated from quantum motion entitled Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm (MQHOA). The calculation accuracy of MQHOA is adjustable. The physical model and mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm are detailed and well interpreted in this paper. The structure of MQHOA is very simple, including merely two phases, the quantum harmonic oscillator process (QHO process) and multi-scale process (M process). Experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MQHOA by applying it to 30 well defined benchmark functions. We also compare MQHOA with several well-known metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO). The comparative results indicate the competitive and superior performance of the proposed algorithm in both convergence speed and optimal solution accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (EFE) supplementation into diets with different non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC)/neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ratios on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and micro biome in Chinese domesticated Lezhi black goats. Treatments were 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of diets using low vs. high NFC/NDF ratios (1.06 or 1.66) and with or without EFE supplementation (0 or 0.4 g cellulase and xylanase/kg dry matter of diet). Sixty four Lezhi black goats (11 +/- 0.8 kg of live weight) were randomly assigned to the four treatments. High NFC/NDF ratio and EFE supplementation achieved greater average daily gain and improve feed conversion ratio (P < .05). The same treatments also significantly increased digestibility of organic matter (OM), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and NDF. In addition, the high NFC/NDF ratio diet, but not the EFE supplement, improved digestibility of crude protein (CP) and reduced ruminal pH (P < .001). Both high NFC/NDF ratio and EFE supplement decreased ruminal NH3-N concentrations significantly (P < .001), and increased the production of rumen total volatile fatty acids (VFA, P < .001), especially the molar proportion of propionate (P < .05). They reduced the molar proportion of acetate and thus the ratio of acetate to propionate (A: P) (P < .05). Both the high NFC/NDF ratio and the EFE supplement elevated the levels of microbial crude proteins (P < .01). Importantly, the combination of high NFC/NDF ratio and the EFE supplement diet raised the content of the microbial crude proteins to the highest levels among the 4 different treatment groups (P = .012). However, the high NFC/NDF ratio and the EFE supplementation had different impacts on fiber degrading activities. The high NFC/NDF ratio diet decreased, while EFE supplementation increased, the activities of cellulase and xylanase (P < .05). Among the three cellulytic bacteria detected (Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Fibrobacter succinogenes), only the abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes was significantly decreased with the high NFC/NDF ratio (P = .004). These results illustrate that the diet with a high NFC/NDF ratio and EFE supplementation can improve ADG, feed conversion ratio and nutrient utilizationin Lezhi black goats. These improvements are likely attributed to the elevated production of microbial crude proteins and a shift in the molar proportions of VFA in the rumen, rather than increase of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen microbiota.

AB Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) are novel fluorescent probes in the second near-infrared window with great imaging quality and biocompatibility. Surface modification is an essential step to disperse Ag2Se QDs into biological fluids, and endow Ag2Se QDs with diverse surface chemistry. However, the effect of surface chemistry on the biological behaviors and chemical fates of Ag2Se QDs has not been studied, which hinders the design of suitable Ag2Se QDs for biomedical applications. Here, the distribution, degradation, excretion and toxicity of 2-aminoethanethiol and mercaptopropionic acid coated Ag2Se QDs (denoted as QDs-MEA and QDs-MPA, respectively) were systematically investigated in mice for a 28-day observation period after a single intravenous injection. Ag2Se QDs with different surface chemistries displayed similar trends in all observations, such as fast blood clearance, main uptake in the liver and spleen, severe biotransformation, Ag excretion through feces, and low toxicity. The major different behaviors observed were the partially pulmonary deposition, the faster transformation at the initial stage, the lower excretion percentage, and the more obvious damage to the liver by QDs-MEA compared to QDs-MPA. The surface chemistry of Ag2Se QDs regulated their biological behaviors and chemical fates in vivo, and surface chemistry should be fully regarded when designing Ag2Se QDs for biomedical applications from the biosafety perspective.

AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive, ritualistic behaviors (compulsions). Findings related to the two components of inhibition, namely interference control and behavioral inhibition, among OCD patients have been inconsistent. It might be that this inconsistency is due to the heterogeneity among OCD cases representing multiple subtypes of OCD, such as autogenous obsessions and reactive obsessions types (AOs vs. ROs). AOs and ROs are distinguished by the category of their most disturbing obsessions. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine whether inhibition functions differ between AO and RO patients. We assessed interference control and behavioral inhibition with the emotional Stroop task (EST) and stop-signal task (SST), respectively, in 42 AOs, 55 ROs and 62 healthy controls (HCs) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in a random subset of these subjects (25 AOs, 25 ROs, and 31HCs). Results showed that in the EST, AOs exhibited longer reaction times (RTs) for color-naming positive-, negative-, and neutral valence word stimulus than both ROs and HCs, and demonstrated larger P2 and less negative N450 amplitudes than HCs and larger P3 amplitudes than ROs and HCs. In the SST, both AOs and ROs showed lengthened stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and reduced Stop-P3 amplitudes in successful inhibition (SI) trials compared to the HC group. These present findings suggest that behavioral inhibition impairment may reflect a common pathology in both the autogenous- and reactive-type OCD patients, whereas interference inhibition impairment appears to be specific to patients with autogenous obsessions. These findings strengthened the insight into the clinical heterogeneity and pathophysiology of OCD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Accipiter virgatus was determined. This mt-genome was 17,952 bp in length and consisted of 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, one control region (CR) and one pseudo-control region (CCR). Phylogenetic analyses of 14,644 bp of mitochondrial DNA (12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) revealed the phylogenetic position of Cathartidae (Cathartes aura) was more closer to Ciconiidae (storks) than Accipitridae. To investigate the divergence times of the CCRs in Falconiformes, detailed analyses of the noncoding regions (CR and CCR) were performed. We found the recently reported novel gene order in Falconiformes had multiple independent origins and hence cannot be used to infer phylogenetic lineages. Indeed, the molecular clock suggested the CCR in Falconidae emerged about 65.4 million years (Mya), while that in Pandionidae-Accipitridae clade emerged about 19.16 Mya. The intra-genomic homology between the noncoding regions was detected in Spilomis cheela, which supporting the duplication hypothesis. Furthermore, the structure of CCR should be featured by a region containing tandem repeats as two definitely separated clusters of tandem repeats were found. The findings presented here should be considered in future phylogenetic and evolutionary studies targeting the pseudo-control regions of all Falconiformes species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spongy graphene adsorbents have attracted great research interest recently, because of the high adsorption capacity, easy handling, and low operating cost. Fabrication of graphene sponge with other high-performance adsorbents might combine the merits of both materials, thus deserves more investigations. In this study, TiO2-graphene sponge (TiO2-GS) was prepared by the deposition of amorphous TiO2 on graphene oxide (GO) sheets for the adsorption of tetracycline antibiotics, where lyophilization was adopted to obtain the porous structure. TiO2-GS adsorbed tetracycline with a large adsorption capacity of 1,805 mg/g, larger than that of GO (313 mg/g) and GO-chitosan aerogel (1,470 mg/g). The adsorption kinetics, which finally reached the equilibrium at 48 h, was clearly controlled by the diffusion of tetracycline to TiO2-GS in the initial stage according to intraparticle diffusion model. Thermodynamics investigation indicated that the adsorption process was endothermic and promoted at higher temperature, with a positive Delta H of 35.8 kJ/mol. Generally, higher pH facilitated the adsorption of tetracycline on TiO2-GS, except that the adsorption was also very effective at pH 1. In contrast, ionic strength had insignificant influence. The adsorbed tetracycline could be washed out with acidic ice-cold water to regenerate TiO2-GS. The implication to the applications of TiO2-GS in water treatment is discussed.

AB Ethylene glycol (EG) is an important platform molecule that can be produced from biomass and waste plastics. The electrochemical upgrading of EG is essential to approach the goal of low-carbon sustainable development. Coin-group metals (CGMs) including Au, Ag, and Cu have recently emerged as promising alternatives to platinum-group metals on selective electrooxidation of EG (EGOR) to value-added C2 chemicals, especially glycolic acid/glycolate. Nevertheless, the corresponding electrocatalytic processes are still indistinct, which is essential to be clarified. Specifically, it shows that the Au and Cu electrodes can exhibit considerable EGOR activity, but not Ag. Product analysis results show that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the EG-to-glycolate pathway on Au surface is over 95% at 1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). It is also around 90% on Cu surface, but Cu electrodes suffer from electrochemical dissolution within the potential range of EGOR, which is urgent to be addressed. Importantly, the different reaction mechanisms of EGOR at Au and Cu are found at the molecular level. In detail, the adsorbed 2-hydroxyacetyl and glyoxal could be the key reaction intermediates for the generation of glycolate at Au and Cu, respectively. This work might provide theoretical guidance for the electrocatalytic conversion of EG into value-added chemicals, which is further conducive to promoting the upgrading of biomass and waste plastics.

AB To enhance the amine-sensitivity of intelligent films for accurate monitoring of chilled meat freshness, different additions (0, 1, 2, 3 wt%) of MIL-100(Fe) were incorporated into the matrix composed of anthocyanins (ANs) and pectin (P). Results indicated that the tensile strength, thermal stability, barrier performance and absorption capacity of the films with MIL-100(Fe) were improved significantly (p < 0.05). Especially, the film with 2 % MIL100(Fe) exhibited the best performance due to its compact structure and the highest crystallinity. Additionally, adsorption isotherms of the films with MIL-100(Fe) were fitted on the Langmuir and the Freundlich isotherm, and adsorption kinetics were fitted on the pseudo-second-order model and Elovich model, respectively (R-2 > 0.96), suggesting a combined mechanism of chemisorption and intraparticle diffusion. Besides, when the films were exposed in ammonia environment, they changed color from purple to blue-violet, finally to green. Ultimately, film with 2 % MIL-100(Fe) was used to monitor the chilled meat freshness, as expected, similar color variation was observed at three stages of meat freshness (fresh, sub-fresh, and spoiled), which enabled the accurate differentiation of meat freshness. Thus, films with MIL-100(Fe) demonstrated the potential to be aminesensitive intelligent packaging for monitoring chilled meat freshness in real time.

AB Achieving healthy active-material microenvironment (ME@AM) for stable and efficient electron/ion transport around each active-material particle is crucial for high-performance battery electrodes. However, this goal has been proved extremely challenging for most high-capacity AMs such as sulfur, owing to its notable volume change and severe shuttle effect. Here, a multifunctional hybrid material with zein protein reinforced catalytic single Cu atom/carbon composite (Cu-C) (zein/Cu-C) is coated onto sulfur/carbon (SC) particle, to prepare the advanced zein/Cu-C@SC core-shell particle. Similar to the multifunctional cell membrane well-known in biology, this multifunctional zein/Cu-C coating helps build a healthy and stable ME@AM within sulfur cathode. Specifically, it can simultaneously provide robust protective shell for the AM particle, adsorption and catalyst function to the dissolved polysulfides, and AM surface treatment to improve AM/conductive agent interface. All these functions are the keys to build and maintain a healthy ME@AM in sulfur cathode. This study not only brings effective solutions to the challenges in volume-change high-capacity sulfur active materials and beyond, but also helps achieve comprehensive understanding of the key factors controlling the structuring and final quality of ME@AM.

AB Passive daytime radiative-cooling materials (characterized by a high solar reflectance and thermal emittance) exhibit a cooling effect under direct sunlight with zero energy consumption, thereby decreasing the demand for air conditioning. Although various well-designed radiative-cooling materials have been reported to date, their syntheses are environmentally harmful and unsuitable for large-scale operation (as they involve complicated, high-cost, or solution-processed methods). In this study, a hierarchical-morphology coating for large-scale radiative-cooling applications was constructed by a one-step, inexpensive, solution-free, and environmentally friendly strategy. The hierarchical morphology (comprising nanospheres and micropores randomly dispersed throughout a polymer matrix) was fabricated through simple mechanical stirring (without the use of templates); no solvents or by-products were produced during the manufacturing process. The optimal coating showed high emissivity (95.1%) in the atmospheric-window band, strong solar reflectivity (94.0%), and a cooling power of 62.94 W m-2 (according to field tests). Moreover, covering the roof of a model with the as-prepared hierarchical-morphology coating reduced the average roof temperature by 11.5 celcius (according to outdoor tests). According to simulations, the coating enabled annual cooling-energy-consumption savings in the range of 14.5-41.2% for typical buildings located in different climatic regions, indicating high potential as an energy-saving building-envelope material.Graphical AbstractA one-step, scalable and sustainable strategy has been developed to fabricate hierarchical-morphology coatings for passive daytime radiative cooling.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) membranes have exhibited excellent molecular sieving properties in several areas, such as water treatment and gas separation, but unsatisfactory permeability and/or selectivity for ionic separation. Meanwhile, the instability of pure GO membranes in acidic solution has significantly impeded the ionic sieving applications. In this study, a kind of GO composite membranes (GO-Cu-TAa) with exceptional aqueous stability and superior ionic sieving properties are successfully prepared by employing a unique natural deposition strategy to introduce copper ions and tannic acid (TA). Based on the synergistic effect of the two cross-linking agents of copper ion and TA, the structural stability and ionic sieving performance of GO-Cu-TAa membranes are obviously enhanced. The resultant membrane with 20% TA loading displays excellent ionic sieving performance in a mixed solution containing K+, Mg2+ and Cr3+ three metal cations, and the selectivities of K+/Mg2+ and K+/Cr3+ are 46.43 and 185.32, respectively. Especially, the permeation rate of K+ ion reaches up to 0.75 mol m-2 h-1. Meanwhile, the ionic sieving property of such GO membranes possesses outstanding reusability and long-term stability. Such a membrane can also effectively separate mono-/multivalent metal cations from the mixed solution contained of the nine metal cations. The selectivities of monovalent/divalent metal cations (such as K+/ Pb2+, K+/Ca2+, K+/Mg2+) are as high as 7.69-51.49, and those of monovalent/trivalent metal cations (such as K+/Fe3+, K+/Cr3+, K+/Al3+) are as high as 247.62-346.67. These results indicate that the GO-Cu-TAa membranes fabricated by the method of natural deposition strategy are expected to be used in the practical applications of lithium extraction from Salt Lake and wastewater purification, etc.

AB Organic pollutants and microorganisms have become the main challenge in sewage treatment for decades. This mainly results from rapidly developing industry and urbanisation. However, simultaneous clearance of the organic pollutants and microorganisms in water still remains challenging in wastewater treatment. To address this problem, a novel molecularly imprinted metal-organic framework (MOF)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hybrid nanofibrous membrane (MOF/PAN-MIM) was prepared for selectively adsorbing bisphenol A (BPA) and inhibiting bacterial fouling in water treatment. Based on the experimental results, the MOF/PAN-MIM showed higher affinity towards BPA as compared to any other organic pollutants and a selective adsorption order of BPA > bisphenol F (BPF) > bisphenol S (BPS) > phenol > nitrophenol > resorcinol with adsorption performance 56.63 mg.g(-1). The kinetics and isotherm models of the adsorption of MOF/PAN-MIM towards BPA are best fitted to a pseudo-second-order mode and a Langmuir isotherm. The cyclic reusability of the membranes was demonstrated by the regeneration experiments, with a removal efficiency of 77.73% towards BPA and a negligible Cu ion leakage of 0.64% after six adsorption-desorption cycles. Additionally, the inhibition rate against E. coli and S. aureus was measured to be greater than 90% via the antibacterial assay. The above results indicated that the as prepared MOF/PAN hybrid nanofibrous membrane has efficient selectivity, sustained cyclic adsorption ability, and antibacterial fouling effect, which can be used as a potential multi-functional filtration membrane in real wastewater treatment.

AB Warming can affect soil microbial respiration by changing microbial biomass and community composition. The responses of soil microbial respiration to warming under experimental conditions are also related to background conditions and the experimental setup, such as warming magnitude, duration, and methods. However, the global pattern of soil microbial respiration in response to warming and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of the response of soil microbial respiration to warming by synthesizing data from 187 field experiments. We found that experimental warming significantly increased soil microbial respiration and microbial biomass carbon by 11.8% and 6.4%, respectively. The warming-induced increase in microbial carbon decomposition was positively correlated with increased microbial biomass carbon, but not community composition. Moreover, the positive response of soil microbial respiration marginally increased with warming magnitude, particularly in short-term experiments, but soil microbial respiration adapted to higher warming at longer timescales. Warming method did not significantly affect the response of microbial respiration, except for a significant effect with open top chamber warming. In addition, the impact of warming on soil microbial respiration was more pronounced in wetter sites and in sites with lower soil pH and higher soil organic carbon. Our findings suggest that warming stimulates microbial respiration mainly by increasing microbial biomass carbon. We also highlight the importance of the combination of warming magnitude and duration in regulating soil microbial respiration responses, and the dependence of warming effects upon background precipitation and soil conditions. These findings can advance our understanding of soil carbon losses and carbon-climate feedbacks in a warm world.

AB Separating of oil-water emulsions under harsh conditions is a major challenge for membrane-based filtration systems. In this study, a well-stabilized electrospinning nanofibrous membrane was successfully fabricated by combining a high-performance engineering polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) with polydopamine (PDA), and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). The employed PEN has comprehensive performance in thermoresistant, anti-corrode and mechanical properties, which was expected to be a robust polymer matrix. Ag NPs were loaded on PEN electrospinning nanofibrous membranes via PDA coating and in situ growth. Morphological measurements revealed a hierarchical structure of fabricated Ag@PDA/PEN membrane with Ag NPs formed in situ covered on the surface. The particle size of Ag NPs was mainly in the range of 50-85 nm and the diameter of PEN fiber was located at similar to 0.39 mu m. The water contact angle (CA) of membranes increased from 30o to 130o by the increasing Ag NPs formation. As a result, the prepared composite membranes reached 4978.71 L/m2h and 99 % for permeate flux and good retention rate for oil-water emulsion separation, respectively. Moreover, the high-performance PEN further endowed the tough stability and durability of the obtained composite membranes, which can tolerate corrosive emulsions, resist high temperatures, and maintain a high separation efficiency after cycle reuse. Furthermore, the as-prepared membranes demonstrated excellent anti-bacterial properties (>99.99 %) inherited from the introduction of Ag NPs. Therefore, the comprehensive anti-corrode, anti-heat, and anti-bacterial performance provide the fabricated robust Ag@PDA/PEN electrospinning nanofibrous membrane a broad prospect for purifying water resources, especially industrial wastewater treatment under harsh conditions.

AB Graphdiyne (GDY) was synthesized and for the first time blended with carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) to modify screen-printed electrode (SPE). Electrochemical response of bisphenol A (BPA) at the as-proposed electrode was studied. And the significant reduction of oxidation peak potential and enhancement of peak current were recorded, showing excellent performance for the determination of BPA. The pH of supporting electrolyte, proportion of GDY and cMWCNTs, and modification amount were optimized. At the optimal conditions, BPA was determined by linear sweep voltammetry with the linear concentration ranging from 0.2 mu M to 500 mu M and the estimated detection limit being 0.013 mu M (S/N = 3). This sensor also showed good performance in BPA measurement of the lake water and tissue samples.

AB Arbitrarily shaped scene text detection has witnessed great development in recent years, and text detection using segmentation has been proven to an effective approach. However, problems caused by the diverse attributes of text instances, such as shapes, scales, and presentation styles (dense or sparse), persist. In this paper, we propose a novel text detector, termed DText, which can effectively formulate an arbitrarily shaped scene text detection task based on dynamic convolution. Our method can dynamically generate independent text-instance-aware convolutional parameters for each text instance from multifeatures thus overcoming some intractable limitations of arbitrary text detection, such as the splitting of similar adjacent text, which poses challenges to fixed instance-shared convolutional parameters-based methods. Unlike standard segmentation methods relying on regions-of-interest bounding boxes, DText focuses on enhancing the flexibility of the network to retain details of instances from diverse resolutions while effectively im proving prediction accuracy. Moreover, we propose encoding the shape and position information according to the characteristics of the text instance, termed text-shape sensitive position embedding. Thus, it can provide explicit shape and position information to the generator of the dynamic convolution parameters. Experiments on five benchmarks (Total-Text, SCUT-CTW1500, MSRA-TD50 0, ICDAR2015, and MLT) showed that our method achieves superior detection performance.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solid state refrigeration technology based on the electrocaloric effect (ECE) has been a promising candidate for replacing vapor-compression refrigeration. Environmentally friendly lead-free ferroelectric materials draw much attention because of the potential of the ECE from their large ferroelectricity and plentiful phase structure. To realize high ECE around room temperature with a broad temperature span (T-span), a typical strategy involves shifting ferroelectric-paraelectric phase boundaries to room temperature along with inevitable relaxor behavior. However, ferroelectricity is always severely deteriorated while lowering the Curie temperature (T-C) to room temperature, limiting the temperature change (Delta T). Herein, a novel strategy based on phase engineering of the incompletely overlapped phase boundaries with rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) and tetragonal-cubic (T-C) phase boundaries is successfully constructed in potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics to enhance the ECE for the first time. Combined with the contribution of electric field behavior, facilitated polarization rotation under electric fields originating from the lowered polarization energy barrier and the strengthening reversion after removing electric fields are revealed along with strong ferroelectricity. Subsequently, a strongly enhanced ECE is achieved, i.e. Delta T =1.14 K at 100 kV cm(-1) and 70 degrees C along with a broad T-span of 34 degrees C, demonstrating improved comprehensive ECE and conforming to the demands of cooling systems of electric devices. Meanwhile, an unusual trend is presented for the electric field dependence of the ECE coefficient (Delta T/Delta E) with the existence of the critical electric field (E-CE), which is relevant to the temperature. This work proposes an environmentally friendly ECE material with high performance for solid-state cooling applications.

AB Mastitis is one of the diseases with the highest incidence in dairy cows, causing huge economic losses to the dairy industry all over the world. The aim of the study was to characterize mastitic milk metabolome through untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR). Taking advantage of the high reproducibility of H-1-NMR, we had the opportunity to provide quantitative information for all the metabolites identified. Fifty-four molecules were characterized, sorted mainly into the chemical groups, namely amino acids, peptides and analogues, carbohydrates and derivates, organic acids and derivates, nucleosides, nucleotides and analogues. Combined with serum metabolomic investigations, several pathways were addressed to explain the mechanisms of milk metabolome variation affected by clinical mastitis, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. These results provide a further understanding of milk metabolome altered by clinical mastitis, which can be used as a reference for the further milk metabolome investigations.

AB The conversion of natural forest to artificial vegetation may deplete nutrients and thus affect the soil quality. However, little is known about synergetic changes of microbial and physicochemical dynamics in soils after natural forest conversion and their implications. In the current study, we synthesized the responses of soil microbial and physicochemical properties in the uppermost soil layer (<20 cm) following natural forest conversion, as reported in 51 published studies (127 sites). Our results showed that the response ratios of soil moisture, soil microbial carbon and nitrogen, bacteria, fungi, enzymatic activities, soil organic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, NO3-, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, cations (K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) overall declined following natural forest replacement. In contrast, natural forest conversion caused significant increases in soil bulk density, soil pH and NH4+. Reductions of microbial carbon, organic carbon and total nitrogen in soil were independent of revegetation type, but variations in soil pH, available phosphorus and fungi were correlated to land use. Soil CEC reduction increased soil pH, allowing soils to retain NH4+, which promoted fungal growth. Moreover, natural forest replacement led to the loss of soil cations in regions of higher precipitation. Revegetation practices led to greater consumption of soil microbial and chemical nutrients and produced "harder" soils (increased soil compaction and decreased moisture content) in warmer regions. Stand age influenced ratios of soil carbon to nitrogen and ratios of bacteria to fungi following natural forest conversion. Altogether, our study suggests that natural forest conversion results in decreased soil microbial and chemical fertility, and desirable soil properties are more likely to be lost in warmer regions and over time as global climate warming exacerbates, which in turn may potentially damage ecosystem sustainability.

AB The wasted acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) have a great potential for recycling. However, it is difficult to recycle them due to the absence of an effective separation method. Permanganate oxidation is a kind of environmental protection process and plays an important role in green chemistry. In this study, the polymer surface modification by potassium permanganate was utilized to separate ABS and HIPS from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) by flotation. Attenuated total internal reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that potassium permanganate can oxidize butadiene and nitrile groups in ABS to form oxygen containing hydrophilic groups. Butadiene in HIPS can also be oxidized to form oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, but the increase is less than that of ABS. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results show that the surface roughness of ABS is improved, but HIPS has no obvious change, which indicates that the surface wettability of ABS can be further improved with the improved surface roughness. The contact angle test results show that the contact angle decrease of ABS after surface modification is significantly higher than that of HIPS. The results showed that the optimum modification conditions are as follows: the concentration of potassium permanganate solution is 50 mM/L, modification temperature of 60 degrees C, and the modification time 30 min. The recovery and purity of ABS are 97.64% and 95.41%, respectively, and the recovery and purity of HIPS are 95.40% and 97.64%, respectively. This research provides a technical support for the high-value recycling of WEEE waste plastic.

AB The fermentation of biomass allows for the generation of major renewable ethanol biofuel that has high energy density favorable for direct alcohol fuel cells in alkaline media. However, selective conversion of ethanol to either CO2 or acetate remains a great challenge. Especially, the ethanol-to-acetate route usually demonstrates decentoxidation current density relative to the ethanol-to-CO2 route that contains strongly adsorbed poisons. This makes the total oxidation of ethanol to CO2 unnecessary. Here, we present a highly active ethanol oxidation electrocatalyst that was prepared by in situ decorating highly dispersed Mo sites on Pd nanosheets (MoOx/ Pd) via a surfactant-free and facile route. We found that similar to 2 atom % of Mo on Pd nanosheets increases the current density to 3.8 A mgPd(-1), around 2 times more active relative to the undecorated Pd nanosheets, achieving nearly 100% faradic efficiency for the ethanol-to-acetate conversion in an alkaline electrolyte without the generation of detectable CO2, evidenced by in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ion chromatography. The selective and CO2-free conversion offers a promising strategy through alcohol fuel cells for contributing comparable current density to power electrical equipment while for selective oxidation of biofuels to useful acetate intermediate for the chemical industry.

AB Many strategies have been employed to artificially reconstruct adipose tissue in tissue engineering. The functionalization and survival of reconstructed adipose tissue depend on sufficient angiogenesis. Notably, agglomeration growth of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) is beneficial to promoting angiogenesis. Herein, we present a porous collagen-based hydrogel for spontaneous agglomeration growth of ASCs to promote angiogenesis. Oxidized starch with different oxidation degree was prepared and used to cross-link collagen to fabricate the porous hydrogel. The gelation time and pore size of hydrogels can be controlled by adjusting the oxidation degree of starch. Crosslinking enhances the mechanical properties, inhibits the swelling and biodegradation of the hydrogels. The hydrogels possess good blood compatibility and cytocompatibility. Significantly, ASCs tended to adhere to the hydrogels and spontaneously grew into spheres along with time. Effective expression of vascular endothelial growth and fibroblast growth factors were observed. Overall, the hydrogels have application prospects in vascularized adipose tissue engineering.

AB FoxO1 is a crucial transcription factor involved in lipid metabolism in mouse liver through repressing a key regulator of lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). However, it remains elusive whether FoxO1 plays roles in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism during lactation in dairy goats. In this study, we aim to investigate the function of FoxO1 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). We found that the expression of FoxO1 is significantly upregulated during lactation compared with the dry period. FoxO1 knockdown enhanced the expression of genes related to de novo fatty acid synthesis (e.g., FASN, ELOVL6 and SCD1) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis (e.g., DGAT2 and GPAM). Consistently, intracellular TAG was significantly increased in FoxO1 knockdown cells and reduced in FoxO1 overexpression cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that insulin suppresses FoxO1 transcription by promoting its nuclear export. Further, we found that FoxO1 inhibits insulin-induced SREBP1 promoter activities in GMECs. Moreover, FoxO1 suppresses SREBP1 transcription via the LXR response element (LXRE) and SREBP response element (SRE) located in the SREBP1 promoter. Our data reveal that FoxO1 plays critical roles in regulating the synthesis of the fatty acid and triacylglycerol (TAG) in GMECs.

AB For some industrial underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) applications, the transmission distance matters more than the communication rate. Attenuation length (AL) is an important distance indicator of UWOC system. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, the spread spectrum (SS) technology is firstly applied in a UWOC system and the capability to extend transmission distance or AL is demonstrated. A 42-m UWOC is experimentally demonstrated with 6.68 ALs. Compared with the conventional not-return-to-zero on-off-keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation scheme, the proposed SS scheme with a spread spectrum gain (SSG) of 5 achieves an AL extension by 0.51 and 0.81, respectively, with the same data rate and bandwidth. And the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by 9 dB to as low as 0.8 dB. Besides, the feature of the SS scheme that could work in a bandwidth-limited long-reach underwater channel without the equalization process is experimentally demonstrated.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of multi-substituted allenes has been developed by a nickel catalyzed SN2' substitution reaction of propargyl esters with organic aluminium reagents under mild conditions, which gave the corresponding multi-substituted allenes in good to excellent yields (up to 92%) and high selectivities (up to 99%) at 60 degrees C for 6 h in THF. Aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in propargyl esters gave products in good yields. In addition, the multi-substituted allenes bearing a thienyl or a pyridyl group were obtained in 95-97% selectivities with isolated yields of 72-83%. Furthermore, the S(N)2' substitution reaction worked efficiently with propargyl carbonate compounds as well. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

AB Smilax glabra (SG) is commonly used as a traditional edible herb in eastern Asia. Recently, sulfur-fumigation has been frequently used in order to obtain better color and a longer storage lifetime. However, the chemical alterations caused by this process remain unknown. The aim of this research was to explore potential chemical diffe rences between non-fumigated and sulfur-fumigated SG samples. A novel approach was developed by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial squared discriminant analysis (OPLSDA). Fifty-eight compounds were unambiguously characterized or tentatively identified in the chemical profiles for the first time. Six newly generated sulfur-containing compounds, namely glucosyringic acid sulfate, 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid sulfite, 3-O-caffeoylshikimic acid sulfite, 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid sulfate, 3-O-caffeoylshikimic acid sulfate and astilbin sulfate, were screened out to be the most characteristic markers for distinguishing non-fumigated and sulfur-fumigated SG. This newly proposed approach can not only be applied for exploring chemical markers but can also be used to investigate the chemical transformation mechanism associated with sulfur for other edible herbs.

AB Graphene materials have attracted great interest nowadays due to their large-scale production and wide applications. It is urgent to evaluate the ecological and environmental risk of graphene materials for the healthy development of the graphene industry. Herein, we evaluated the influence of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) on the growth, structure and decomposition activity of white-rot fungus, whose decomposition function is vital for carbon cycle. RGO slightly stimulated the fresh weight and dry weight gains of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. A larger number of fibrous structures were observed at low RGO concentrations in P. chrysosporium, which was consistent with the elongation of cells observed under a transmission electron microscope. RGO did not affect the chemical composition of P. chrysosporium. Moreover, the laccase production of P. chrysosporium was not influenced by RGO. The degradation activities of P. chrysosporium for dye and wood appeared to be promoted slightly, but the differences were insignificant compared to the control. Therefore, RGO had low toxicity to white-rot fungus and was relatively safe for the carbon cycle.

AB Choline phosphate (CP) containing polymers modified surfaces have been shown good resist to the adhesion of proteins while prompt the attaching of mammalian cells due to the dipole pairing between the CP groups of the polymer and the phosphorylcholine (PC) groups on the cell membrane. However, the antifouling activities of CP modified surface against microbes have not been investigated at present. In addition, CP containing polymers modified surface with different molecular architectures has not been prepared and studied. To this end, glass slides surface modified with two different 2(meth-acryloyloxy)ethyl cholinephosphate (MCP) containing polymer (PMCP) structures, i.e. brush-like (Glass-PMCP) and bottle brush-like (Glass-PHEMA-g-PMCP) architectures, were prepared in this work by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The surface physichemical and antifouling properties of the prepared surfaces were characterized and studied. The Glass-PMCP shows improved antifouling properties against proteins and bacteria as compared to pristine glass slides (Glass-OH) and glass slides grafted with poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Glass-PHEMA). Notably, a synergetic fouling resistant properties of PHEMA and PMCP is presented for Glass-PHEMA-g-PMCP, which shows superior antifouling activities over Glass-PHEMA and Glass-PMCP. Furthermore, glass slides containing PMCP, i.e. Glass-PMCP and Glas-PHEMA-g-PMCP, decrease platelet adhesion and prevent their activation significantly. Therefore, the combination of antifouling PHEMA and PMCP into one system holds potential for prevention of bacterial fouling and biomaterial-centered infections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) have been widely used in tumor drainage lymph node (TDLN) imaging, drug delivery, photothermal therapy, and so on. However, during the theranostic applications, the accumulation efficiency of CNPs in target organs is unknown yet, which largely hinders the extension of CNPs into clinical uses. Herein, we prepared skeleton-labeled C-13-CNPs that had identical properties to commercial CNPs suspension injection (CNSI) for the imaging and quantification in TDLN. C-13-CNPs were prepared by arc discharge method, followed by homogenization with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The size distribution and morphology of C-13-CNPs were nearly the same as those of CNSI under transmission electron microscope. The hydrodynamic radii of both C-13-CNPs and CNSI were similar, too. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy analyses, the chemical compositions and chemical states of elements were also nearly identical for both labeled and commercial forms. The skeleton labeling of C-13 was reflected by the shift of G-band toward lower frequency in Raman spectra. C-13-CNPs showed competitive performance in TDLN imaging, where the three lymph nodes (popliteal lymph node, common iliac artery lymph node, and paraaortic lymph node) were stained black upon the injection into the hind extremity of mice. The direct quantification of C-13-CNPs indicated that 877 mu g/g of C-13-CNPs accumulated in the first station of TDLN (popliteal lymph node). The second station of TDLN (common iliac artery lymph node) had even higher accumulation level (1,062 mu g/g), suggesting that C-13-CNPs migrated efficiently along lymphatic vessel. The value decreased to 405 mu g/g in the third station of TDLN (paraaortic lymph node). Therefore, the (13)CCNPs provided quantitative approach to image and quantify CNSI in biological systems. The implication in biomedical applications and biosafety evaluations of CNSI is discussed.

AB Fenton reaction based on Fe2+-H2O2 system has been widely applied in water remediation, but the obvious drawbacks largely hinder its practical uses. Alternatively, heterogeneous nanomaterials with proper surface modification could be used as Fenton-like catalysts. Surface doping of TiO2 could concentrate the pollutants surrounding the Fe3O4 catalyst, which might benefit the catalytic performance of Fe3O4. Herein, we reported that TiO2-doped Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) could be used as high-performance Fenton-like catalyst for dye decoloration in near neutral environment, where the doping of TiO2 on Fe3O4 surface dramatically improved the catalytic activity of Fe3O4 in Fenton-like reaction. TiO2-doped Fe3O4 NPs catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to oxidize methylene blue without external energy supply, resulting in effective decoloration. TiO2-doped Fe3O4 NPs showed high catalytic activity under various pH values and even in the presence of radical scavenger. More catalysts and H2O2 would facilitate the decoloration. At higher temperature, the decoloration became faster and more effective. The implication to the environmental applications of TiO2-doped Fe3O4 NPs is discussed.

AB The enzyme immobilization has been adopted to enhance the activity and stability of enzymes in non-aqueous enzymatic catalysis. However, the activation and stabilization mechanism has been poorly understood on experiments. Thus, we used molecular dynamics simulation to study the adsorption of a-chymotrypsin (alpha-ChT) on carbon nanotube (CNT) in aqueous solution and heptane media. The results indicate that a-ChT has stronger affinity with CNT in aqueous solution than in heptane media, as confirmed by more adsorption atoms, larger contact area and higher binding free energies. Although the immobilization causes significant structure deviations from the crystal one, no significant changes in secondary structure of the enzyme upon adsorption are observed in the two media. Different from aqueous solution, the stabilization effects on some local regions far from the surface of CNT were observed in heptane media, in particular for S1 pocket, which should contribute to the preservation of specificity reported by experiments. Also, CNT displays to some extent stabilization role in retaining the catalytic H-bond network of the active site in heptane media, which should be associated with the enhanced activity of enzymes. The observations from the work can provide valuable information for improving the catalytic properties of enzymes in non-aqueous media.

AB Magnetic colloidal nanocrystal clusters (MCNCs) modified with different amounts of poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium (PSSMA) have been prepared through simple one-step solvothermal method for removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The prepared MCNCs are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Moreover, effects of the solution pH, contact time, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength and initial dye concentration on MB adsorption onto the MCNCs are systematically investigated. The PSSMA-modified MCNCs show fast and highly-efficient MB removal capacity, which dramatically depends on the immobilization amounts of PSSMA, solution pH and adsorbent dosage. Their adsorption kinetics and isotherms exhibit that the kinetics and equilibrium adsorptions can be well-described by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir model, respectively. These magnetic nanocomposites, with high separation efficiency, low production cost and recyclable property, are promising as functional adsorbents for efficient removal of cationic organic pollutants from aqueous solution.

AB Although decades of efforts have been spent studying the pathogenesis of social anxiety disorder (SAD), there are still no objective biological markers that could be reliably used to identify individuals with SAD. Studies using multivariate pattern analysis have shown the potential value in clinically diagnosing psychiatric disorders with neuroimaging data. We therefore examined the diagnostic potential of regional homogeneity (ReHo) underlying neural correlates of SAD using support vector machine (SVM), which has never been studied. Forty SAD patients and pairwise matched healthy controls were recruited and scanned by resting-state fMRI. The ReHo was calculated as synchronization of fMRI signals of nearest neighboring 27 voxels. A linear SVM was then adopted and allowed the classification of the two groups with diagnostic accuracy of ReHo that was 76.25% (sensitivity = 70%, and specificity = 82.5%, P <= 0.001). Regions showing different discriminating values between diagnostic groups were mainly located in default mode network, dorsal attention network, self-referential network, and sensory networks, while the left medial prefrontal cortex was identified with the highest weight. These results implicate that ReHo has good diagnostic potential in SAD, and thus may provide an initial step towards the possible use of whole brain local connectivity to inform the clinical evaluation.

AB Mammalian skeletal myogenesis is a complex process that allows precise control of myogenic cells' proliferation, differentiation, and fusion to form multinucleated, contractile, and functional muscle fibers. Typically, myogenic progenitors continue growth and division until acquiring a differentiated state, which then permanently leaves the cell cycle and enters terminal differentiation. These processes have been intensively studied using the skeletal muscle developing models in vitro and in vivo, uncovering a complex cellular intrinsic network during mammalian skeletal myogenesis containing transcription factors, translation factors, extracellular matrix, metabolites, and mechano-sensors. Examining the events and how they are knitted together will better understand skeletal myogenesis's molecular basis. This review describes various regulatory mechanisms and recent advances in myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation during mammalian skeletal myogenesis. We focus on significant cell cycle regulators, myogenic factors, and chromatin regulators impacting the coordination of the cell proliferation versus differentiation decision, which will better clarify the complex signaling underlying skeletal myogenesis.

AB In this study, first-principles calculations were used to conduct in-depth studies on multiple key aspects of Ndoped defective graphene modified with Mg atoms, including structure, electronic property, thermal stability, as well as hydrogen storage performance and mechanism. The research results show that after the introduction of Mg, N atoms and vacancy defects, pristine graphene transforms from semi-metallic property to metallic property. And the AIMD results indicate excellent thermodynamic stability of the substrate. It can adsorb up to seven H2 molecules, and the adsorption energy values is between -0.15 and -0.21 eV, which is in the stable energy range (-0.15 to -0.60 eV). The hydrogen storage mechanism is mainly attributed to the van der Waals force caused by the polarization of H2 molecules and orbital hybridization between H atoms and the substrate. The calculation of the desorption temperature shows that this substrate can become a potential candidate for reversible hydrogen storage materials at temperatures above 206 K. Compared with graphene decorated with Mg atoms, the introduction of N atoms and vacancy defects significantly improved the hydrogen storage performance.

AB The unsatisfactory bitterness of quercetin restricts its application to healthy food systems. In this study, whey protein isolate (WPI) inserted and coated quercetin-loaded liposomes were compared in reducing quercetin bitterness and improving the stability of quercetin-loaded liposomes. By electronic tongue and sensory evaluation, the liposomes coated by WPI (0.5-3.0 mg/mL) and inserted with WPI (0.5 mg/mL) significantly reduced the bitterness of quercetin compared to physical mixing. It was also found that the encapsulation efficiency was increased by 15.24% after insertion of WPI at 2.0 mg/mL. The environmental stability results showed that both WPI insertion and coating improved the thermal stability of the quercetin-loaded liposomes compared to the physical mixture, and the WPI coated quercetin-loaded liposomes had the best storage stability and tolerance to salt ions. In contrast, WPI insertion improved the ability of liposomes to resist against surfactant. Raman spectra and fluorescence analysis demonstrated that the modification of WPI reduced the free motion of lipid molecules and promoted the ordering at the polar headgroup area and hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. These findings have the potential to support the utilization of WPI modified liposomes as promising option for an efficient transportation of bitter bioactive compounds in nutraceutical and functional foods.

AB The expeditious healing of chronic wounds with bacterial infections poses a formidable challenge in clinical practice because of the persistent bacterial presence, excessive inflammation, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in clinical practice. Thus, in this study, natural antimicrobial material microneedles (MNs) with multifunctional properties were prepared by adding peony leaf extract (PLE) into a matrix of methacrylated Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSPMA) and methacrylated chitosan (CSMA) via cross-linking under ultra-violet light to accelerate the rapid healing of chronic wounds with bacterial infections. Results showed that BCPMNs effectively inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and accelerated the healing of infected wounds by enhancing cell migration, epidermal regeneration, pro-collagen deposition, and angiogenesis and reducing inflammation. Furthermore, BCP-MNs not only possessed good mechanical properties, stability, and biocompatibility but also showed potent antioxidant effects to eliminate excessive ROS accumulation in the wound bed. In conclusion, BCP-MNs possess multifunctional wound-healing properties and can serve as excellent wound dressing in to treat infected wounds.

DE Radish paocai; Spontaneous fermentation; Flavor -related components;
   Core bacterial community
AB The effects of different varieties of radish on the quality and flavor of radish paocai are still elusive. Herein, this study aimed to compare the quality and flavor of radish paocai fermented by three kinds of radish, and further investigate the core bacterial community that mainly positively correlated with the quality and flavor improvement of paocai. As fermentation proceeded, pH and nitrite decreased, total acid and reducing sugar increased, and salinity showed a fluctuating decrease. Besides, LL had the highest content of reducing sugar and free amino acids, and CB had more organic acids and umami amino acids than other kinds of paocai. The bacterial community analysis confirmed that the variety of radish had little impact on bacterial succession, and Weissella, Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc were found to be the core bacterial community that could promote the increase of organic acids, free amino acids, and volatile flavor compounds. In particular, Weissella was the biomarker on day 4 of fermentation, and Lactobacillus was the biomarker on day 7 in three kinds of radish paocai. Collectively, using different varieties of radish did not significantly induce change in the bacterial community of the radish paocai, although these radish paocai products presented different qualities and flavors.

AB Microsphere with sphere-in-capsule structure is a multi-drugs delivery system to achieve the purpose of com-bination therapy. In this paper, we have prepared gelatin/alginate-based microspheres with sphere-in-capsule structure by a relatively fast, simple, and easily large-scale industrialized emulsification method for spatiotem-poral manipulative drug release in gastrointestinal tract. Calcium alginate microspheres encapsulated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were first prepared as inner microspheres, and then inner microspheres and ra-nitidine hydrochloride (RH) were co-encapsulated by gelatin microspheres to form double-layer microspheres with sphere-in-capsule structure. The size and distribution of microspheres can be easily controlled by emulsi-fying conditions. The microspheres with sphere-in-capsule structure displayed desirable encapsulation efficiency of BSA (61.52 %) and RH (56.07 %). The in vitro simulated drug release showed the spatiotemporal release feature of microspheres with sphere-in-capsule structure. In the specific simulated fluid, the release behavior and cumulative release of RH (sustainedly released 95 % in simulated gastric fluid) and BSA (rapidly released 73 % in simulated intestinal fluid) were different. The drug release mechanisms were analyzed to determine RH and BSA's release behavior. Overall, the microspheres with sphere-in-capsule structure have the potential application of spatiotemporal manipulative drug delivery in the gastrointestinal tract.

AB Wheat gluten peptides (WGPs), identified as Leu-Leu (LL), Leu-Leu-Leu (LLL), and Leu-Met-Leu (LML), were tested for their impacts on cell growth, membrane lipid composition, and membrane homeostasis of yeast under ethanol stress. The results showed that WGP supplementation could strengthen cell growth and viability and enhance the ethanol stress tolerance of yeast. WGP supplementation increased the expressions of OLE1 and ERG1 and enhanced the levels of oleic acid (C18:1) and ergosterol in yeast cell membranes. Moreover, LLL and LML exhibited a better protective effect for yeast under ethanol stress compared to LL. LLL and LML supplementation led to 20.3 +/- 1.5% and 18.9 +/- 1.7% enhancement in cell membrane fluidity, 21.8 +/- 1.6% and 30.5 +/- 1.1% increase in membrane integrity, and 26.3 +/- 4.8% and 27.6 +/- 4.6% decrease in membrane permeability in yeast under ethanol stress, respectively. The results from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) elucidated that WGP supplementation is favorable for the maintenance of yeast cell morphology under ethanol stress. All of these results revealed that WGP is an efficient enhancer for improving the ethanol stress tolerance of yeast by regulating the membrane lipid composition.

AB The mobilization of body reserves during the transition from pregnancy to lactation might predispose dairy cows to develop metabolic disorders such as subclinical ketosis or hyperketonemia. These conditions are not easily identifiable and are frequently related to other diseases that cause economic loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum metabolome differences according to the beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration. Forty-nine Holstein Friesian dairy cows were enrolled between 15 and 30 days in milk. According to their serum BHB concentration, the animals were divided into three groups: Group 0 (G0; 12 healthy animals; BHB <= 0.50 mmol/L); Group 1 (G1; 19 healthy animals; 0.51 <= BHB < 1.0 mmol/L); and Group 2 (G2; 18 hyperketonemic animals; BHB >= 1.0 mmol/L). Animal data and biochemical parameters were examined with one-way ANOVA, and metabolite significant differences were examined by t-tests. Fifty-seven metabolites were identified in the serum samples. Thirteen metabolites showed significant effects and seemed to be related to the mobilization of body reserves, lipids, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, and ruminal fermentation.

AB Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumor that tends to occur in adolescents, with surgical resection of the tumor tissue as its standard treatment. After surgery, long-term chemotherapy should be performed to prevent patients from recrudescence. However, conventional chemotherapy drugs impose many serious side effects on patients. It is significant to optimize a chemotherapy drug delivery system. Herein, we present an injectable self-healing hydrogel carrying curcumin with pH-responsive drug release and selective toxicity for osteosarcoma therapy. Amino-gelatin and oxidized starch were synthesized and used as substrates to prepare hydrogels based on imine linkages. Polymerized beta-CD was synthesized to encapsulate curcumin and incorporate it into hydrogels. As a dynamic covalent bond, imine linkages endowed the hydrogel with injectability and self-healing properties. Under acidic conditions, the hydrogel presented a pH-responsive curcumin release property due to instable imine linkages, showing a higher cumulative release of curcumin at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4. Moreover, hydrogels could continuously release curcumin for more than 28 days, featuring a sudden early release and a slow late release. Interestingly, differentiated from healthy osteoblasts, the hydrogel showed selective cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells and could even accelerate the differentiation of osteoblasts owing to the incorporation of curcumin. Briefly speaking, as a drug delivery system, the composite hydrogel can be widely applied for osteosarcoma treatment.

AB The development of membrane for heavy metal ion removal in water treatment is still impeded by low adsorption efficiency, poor selectivity, and deficient recyclability, which has gained great interests in both laboratorial research and industrial application. Herein, our aim is to fabricate the magnetic ion-imprinted PAN membranes (MII-PMs) based on polyacrylonitrile electro-spun nanofibers with improved adsorption ability, selectivity, and recyclability for efficient and selective removal of Pb(II) from water. The chemical structure and chemo-physical properties of the as prepared MII-PMs were characterized. Remarkably, in competitive adsorption experiment the MII-PMs demonstrated a much higher adsorption capacity towards Pb(II) than other interfering metal ions with the selective order of Pb2+> Cu2+> Mg2+> Co2+> Ni2+> Cd2+> Zn2+> Na+> K+. In investigation of the adsorption mechanism towards Pb(II), the equilibrium adsorption data of MII-PMs fitted better with Freundlich isotherm equation, and the kinetic parameters matched well with pseudo-second-order mode. In regeneration and reusability experiment, the MII-PMs could be regenerated with eluting solution and displayed good adsorption capacity towards Pb(II) during 6 adsorption-desorption cycles. Only small amount of Fe ions was leached out after the regeneration experiments. Generally, the as prepared magnetic ion imprinted membrane with improved adsorption capability, high selectivity, and excellent reusability towards Pb (II) ions can be utilized as a promising and efficiently potential adsorbent in actual water treatment.

AB Graphene adsorbents are widely applied in pollutant removal with high adsorption capacities. However, the contradiction between high capacity and poor regeneration hinders the practical applications of graphene adsorbents in aqueous systems. In this study, we designed a magnetic Fe3O4/TiO2/graphene sponge (MFTGS) for dye adsorption in aqueous solution. Small Fe3O4 and TiO2 nanoparticles were decorated on the graphene sheets. MFTGS could be magnetically separated in aqueous systems with a saturated magnetization of 17.0 emu/g. MFTGS showed a moderately large capacity of 224 mg/g for methylene blue (MB). The adsorption could reach the equilibrium within 10 min with a k(2) constant of 4.48 x 10(-4) g/mg.min(-1). The adsorption of MB on MFTGS was driven by entropy production, so the capacity increased at higher temperature. The decrease of pH value and increase of ionic strength slightly lowered the adsorption capacity of MFTGS. MFTGS could be easily regenerated by ethanol washing, where 80% of the capacity retained after 4 cycles. Our results provided high-performance magnetic graphene adsorbents for dye removal and would benefit the development of graphene nanotechnology.

AB The resource utilization of distillers' grains (DGs) is an essential issue for the sustainable development of Chinese bai jiu industry. In this study, metal oxide (MxOy, M=Mg, Al and Fe) loaded biochar (M-BC) was prepared by using DGs for the production of novel adsorption/release materials for phosphate (P). The results indicated that the P adsorption capacity of Mg-BC, Al-BC and Fe-BC were as high as 14.74, 8.06 and 14.51 mg P/g, respectively. XPS and FTIR analysis demonstrated that the adsorption mechanism of M-BC for P included electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange, precipitation and ligand exchange. The release of P from M-BC+P could be controlled by low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), which were affected by the loaded metal oxides on the biochar. The release of P from Mg-BC+P was higher than 70 % after 7 days, which was about 60 % if Al-BC+P was used. Thus, M-BC+P can be used as a high-performance controlled release phosphate fertilizer, providing a promising value-added application approach for the bai jiu distillers' grains.

AB Gut microbiota during early life could influence host fitness in vertebrates. Studies on how gut microbiota colonize the gut in birds using frequent sampling during early developmental stages and how shifts in microbiota diversity influence host growth are lacking. Here, we examine the microbiome profiles of 151 fecal samples from 14 young crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), an endangered bird species, collected longitudinally across 13 time points during the early stages of development and investigated their correlation with host growth. Gut diversity showed a non-linear change during development, which involved multiple colonization and extinction events, mainly associated with Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Gut microbiota in young crested ibis became more similar with increasing age. In addition, gut microbiota exhibited a strong temporal structure and two specific developmental stages; the beginning of the latter stage coincided with the introduction of fresh loach, with a considerable increase in the relative abundance of Fusobacteria and several Firmicutes, which may be involved in lipid metabolism. Crested ibis chick growth rate was negatively correlated with gut microbiota diversity and negatively associated with the abundance of Halomonadaceae, Streptococci, Corynebacteriaceae, and Dietziaceae. Our findings highlight the importance of frequent sampling when studying microbiome development during early stages of development of vertebrates. The role of microbial diversity in host growth during the early stages of development of birds warrants further investigations.

AB In this study, we tested a possible mechanism of the association between math anxiety and math achievement: the mediating role of math-specific grit (i.e., sustaining effort in the face of adversity when learning math). In Study 1, a sample of 10th grade students (N = 222) completed a battery of personality and attitude questionnaires, and math achievement was indexed by curriculum-based examination scores. Mediation analyses indicated that math-specific grit, but not domain-general grit, mediated the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. In Study 2, we replicated and extended the above findings with another sample of 11th grade students (N = 465). Mediation analyses indicated that math-specific grit and math-specific procrastination played sequential mediating roles in the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. That is, individuals with higher math anxiety were less gritty in math learning, possibly further leading them to be more procrastinated in performing math work, which may finally result in worse math achievement. In summary, the current study provides the first evidence that math-specific grit may mediate the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. Furthermore, it also demonstrated the value of math-specific grit over domain-general grit in predicting math success, which invites a broader investigation on subject-specific grit.

AB Trichothecenes are groups of chemically related toxins formed by some filamentous fungal species such as Fusarium, Myrothecium, and Stachybotrys. T-2 toxin (T-2), HT-2 toxin (HT-2), neosolaniol (NEO), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), monoacetoxyscirpenol (MAS), Verrucarol (VER), Scirpentriol (SCP), and their derivatives are reported as representative type A trichothecenes. Recent advances in the toxicological effects and occurrence of type A trichothecenes as well as their detection and decontamination methods were reviewed in this study. Type A trichothecenes have been detected in numerous food and feed materials and the most popular detection technique was liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. T-2 and HT-2 were considered as the most prevalent type A trichothecenes in cereals, especially in barley, oats, and animal feeds. Although the concentrations of the detected type A trichothecenes were generally low, severely contaminated samples were observed occasionally which may harm the health of human and animals. Literatures on the occurrence of NEO, MAS, VER, and SCP are still limited. More research on monitoring their prevalence in agricultural products and efficient techniques to reduce their prevalence and harmful effects are needed.

AB Background Dunaliella salina is a good model organism for studying salt stress. In order to have a global understanding of the expression profiles of Dunaliella salina in response to hypersaline stress, we performed quantitative transcriptomic analysis of Dunaliella salina under hypersaline stress (2.5 M NaCl) of different time duration by the second and third generation sequencing method. Results Functional enrichment of the up-regulated genes was used to analyze the expression profiles. The enrichment of photosynthesis was observed, accompanied by enrichments of carbon fixation, pigment biosynthetic process and heme biosynthetic process, which also imply the enhancement of photosynthesis. Genes responsible for starch hydrolysis and glycerol synthesis were significantly up-regulated. The enrichment of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids implies the plasma membrane undergoes changes in desaturation pattern. The enrichment of endocytosis implies the degradation of plasma membrane and might help the synthesis of new glycerophospholipid with unsaturated fatty acids. Co-enrichments of protein synthesis and degradation imply a higher protein turnover rate. The enrichments of spliceosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum imply the enhancement of regulations at post-transcriptional and post-translational level. No up-regulation of any Na+ or Cl- channels or transporters was detected, which implies that the extra exclusion of the ions by membrane transporters is possibly not needed. Voltage gated Na+ and Cl- channels, mechanosensitive ion channel are possible signal receptors of salt stress, and Ca2+ and MAP kinase pathways might play a role in signal transduction. Conclusion At global transcriptomic level, the response of Dunaliella salina to hypersaline stress is a systematic work, possibly involving enhancements of photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and heme biosynthetic process, acceleration of protein turnover, spliceosome, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, and endocytosis, as well as degradation of starch, synthesis of glycerol, membrane lipid desaturation. Altogether, the changes of these biological processes occurred at trancriptomic level will help understand how a new intracellular balance achieved in Dunaliella salina to adapt to hypersaline environment, which are worth being confirmed at the physiological levels.

AB To obtain outstanding electrical properties of Barium titanate based ceramics to meet the requirements of the practical applications, a new system of BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3-(0.5-x)Ba0.7Ca0.3TiO3-xBa(0.7)Sr(0.3)TiO(3) (BZTBCT-xBST, 0 <= x <= 0.5) lead-free material was designed. A systematic study about piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and strain properties was carried out in the ceramics. The BZT-BCT-xBST ceramics with x = 0.3 exhibit an enhanced electrical property (e.g., d(33)similar to 540 pC/N, k(p)similar to 0.42, epsilon(r) similar to 4560, tan delta similar to 0.023, and strain0.132% @30 kV/cm) as well as a good electrostrictive behavior (Q(33) similar to 0.0366m(4)C(-2), Strain0.08%), and Q33 value is compared to PZT-baesd materials. In addition, the influence of external fields (temperature, electric field) on strain stability reveals that the strain under high driving electric fields has comparatively good temperature stability. We firmly believe that such a work can be beneficial to the practical process of BT-based ceramics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The yak is one of the most important domestic animals in Tibetan life for providing basic resources such as milk, meat and transportation. Although yak milk production is not elevated, yak milk is superior to dairy cow milk in nutrient composition (protein and fat). However, the understanding of the metabolic mechanisms of yak mammary gland tissue during the lactation cycle remains elusive. In this study, GC-MS-based metabolomics was employed to study the metabolic variations in the yak mammary gland during the lactation cycle (pregnancy, lactation and dry period). Twenty-nine metabolites were up or downregulated during the lactation period. Compared to the dry period, during the lactation period the levels of oxalic acid were upregulated, while glycine and uridine were downregulated. Thirty-seven pathways were obtained when the 29 differential metabolites were imported into the KEGG pathway analysis. The most impacted pathways during the lactation cycle were glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; TCA cycle; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; and pyrimidine metabolism. Our results provide important insights into the metabolic events involved in yak mammary gland development, lactogenesis and lactation, which can guide further research to improve milk yield and enhance the constituents of yak milk.

AB A series of fluorinated polyurethanes (FPUs) with various contents of fluorinated chain extender (EF) and the same amount of poly(oxytetramethylene glycol) and diphenylmethanediisocyanate were synthesized to explore the relationship between the surface physicochemical properties and bulk microphase separation structures of these FPUs and their antifouling activities against model bacteria and platelets. The bulk microphase separation of FPUs increased with the amount of incorporated EF. It was found that the surfaces of all FPUs were saturated by a layer of fluorocarbon chains which resulted in similar chemical composition and wetting activities for the three kinds of FPUs. The FPUs with lower or similar microphase separation compared with non-fluorinated polyurethane chain-extended with 1,4-butanediol showed similar or even increased adhesion of bacteria and platelets. Notably, FPU with a higher degree of microphase separation than non-fluorinated polyurethane displayed excellent antifouling activities against both model bacteria and blood platelets. It is therefore concluded that the increased microphase separation of the FPUs results in enhanced antifouling properties. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The yak (Bosgrunniens) is a unique domestic bovine species that plays an indispensable role for herdsmen in the Qinghai- Tibet Plateau. Here, 336 diarrhoeic samples were collected from yaks on 29 farms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2015 to 2017. Approximately 69.05 % (232/336) of the diarrhoeic samples were assessed as bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-positive by RT-PCR assay, and most of the detected strains showed a unique evolution based on 40 spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene fragments. Notably, the 12 complete S genes detected shared 1 identical amino acid mutation (E121V) in the S1 subunit compared with the other 150 complete S genes in the GenBank database. Furthermore, a BCoV strain (designated YAK/HY24/CH/2017) was isolated from one diarrhoeic sample (virus titre :10(8.17)TCID(50) ml(-1)), and a phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences revealed that strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 has the closest genetic relationship with the BCoV prototype strain Mebus. Interestingly, 2 significant characteristics were observed in the genome of strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017: (1) the strain had 26 unique amino acid variations in the S gene compared with the other 150 BCoV S genes in the GenBank database and (2) a recombination event was identified between the esterase and lectin domains of the HE gene. In conclusion, this study revealed the high prevalence of BCoV in yaks in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the molecular prevalence of BCoV in yaks and of a BCoV genome with an HE gene recombination.

Motivated by the fact, we here propose a memory mechanism with weighting whose core lies in three aspects: (i) Each player applies a memory rule to compare its own historical accumulated payoffs inside the range of memory length and to take the maximal one and corresponding strategy as historical optimal accumulated payoff and historical optimal strategy; (ii) Each neighbour of a player is endowed with a weighting which is the ratio of historical optimal accumulated payoff of each neighbour to the total historical optimal accumulated payoff of all neighbours of the player; (iii) Each player interacts with a neighbour selected by probability equal to weighting, and then updates its historical optimal strategy according to Fermi function. The asynchronous updating algorithm is used to study the evolution of cooperation with different memory lengths on a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism effectively promotes cooperation in three classical social dilemmas. Moreover, it is revealed that the cooperation level, by and large, increases first and then decreases as the memory length increases in the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game, and that the cooperation level increases as so does the memory length in the stag-hunt game.

AB Background and Objective Use of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) has led to considerable improvements in the clinical outcome of patients with various tumor types. However, VEGFR-TKIs may be associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular toxicities. We conducted this meta-analysis to systematically review the risk of cardiovascular toxicities with VEGFR-TKIs in cancer patients.
   Methods The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with VEGFR-TKIs were retrieved and a systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published until April 2018.
   Results A total of 77 randomized controlled trials and 27,353 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of VEGFR-TKIs significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular toxicities, such as all-grade and high-grade hypertension, all-grade bleeding, and all-grade cardiac dysfunction. Hypertension was the most common cardiovascular toxicity. There was no significant increased risk of all-grade and high-grade thromboembolism, high-grade bleeding, and high-grade cardiac dysfunction associated with these agents.
   Conclusions The available data suggest that the use of VEGFR-TKIs is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular toxicities in cancer patients. Clinicians should be aware of this risk and perform regular cardiovascular monitoring.

AB A combination chrome tanning technology which endows leather high chrome exhaustion and thermal property based on hydroxyl-terminated dendrimer (HTD) is reported. The chrome concentration in effluent, denaturation temperature (Td), enthalpy (DM), thermal degradation active energy (Ea), cross linking degree of wet-blue leathers are determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetry analysis (TG-DTG), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The element (especially chromium) content and distribution of wet-blue leather are also obtained by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). The results show that the chrome uptake, Td, Delta H and Ea of wet-blue leather tanned with HTD and basic chrome sulphate (HTD-Cr) can reach 94.1%, 117.4 degrees C and 432.2 J/g, and 153.1 kJ/mol much higher than conventional chrome tanning which is 66.1%, 112.5 degrees C and 129.2 J/g and 147.21 kJ/mol, respectively. It is because HTD could act as excellent masking agent with good alkaline stability, which slows down the basifying process and promotes chrome penetration towards central of wet-blue leather, resulting in evenly dispersed along the grain layer, middle layer and flesh layer of wet-blue leather. Consequently, crosslinking density of collagen increased, thereby inhibiting the outward diffusion of chrome and improving the chrome uptake. In contrast, for blank trial, the chrome mainly aggregate at grain layer and flesh layer. These results illustrate the chrome tanning promotion mechanism of HTD and provide a valuable insight of developing high exhausted chrome agent based on dendrimer for more sustainable future of leather industry.

AB Consumers demand more alternatives of riskless antibacterial agents to prevent microbial contamination in food industry. Oxidized carbohydrate may be a potential option as new antibacterial agent. However, the relatively weak antibacterial property of oxidized carbohydrate is not satisfactory. In this paper, dialdehyde beta-cyclodextrins with different oxidation degree were prepared by periodate oxidation and their antibacterial properties were systematically studied. The results showed that multi-aldehyde groups were successfully introduced into beta-cyclodextrin molecules by periodate oxidation. The aqueous solubility and stability of dialdehyde beta-cyclodextrins were improved as expected. It is interesting that dialdehyde beta-cyclodextrins possessed outstanding antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentrations against E. coli, S. aureus and B. subtilis reached 0.63, 1.25 and 0.63 mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, dialdehyde beta-cydodextrins effectively inhibited bacterial growth on the surface of apples. The results demonstrated that oxidized oligosaccharide with multi-aldehyde groups and good dispersibility in aqueous solution possessed satisfactory antibacterial activity, which can be used as new antibacterial agent in food industry.

AB Instance-based learning often uses all instances in a training set to construct inference structures. The large number of instances and attributes may lead to high storage requirements and low search efficiency. Instance reduction is developed to address these issues by removing irrelevant instances and noises from the training set. However, existing reduction techniques still have the shortcomings of parameter dependency and relatively low accuracy and reduction rates. In this study, we present a natural neighborhood graph-based instance reduction algorithm, namely, NNGIR. A natural neighborhood graph (NaNG) is automatically constructed by the natural neighbor search algorithm. This graph can provide a compact description of the nearest neighbor relation over pairs of instances. NNGIR applies NaNG to divide the original training set into noisy, border and internal instances. Next, the algorithm obtains a reduced set by eliminating noisy and redundant points. NNGIR has three main advantages: (1) it is a non-parameter instance reduction algorithm due to the use of natural neighborhood graphs; (2) it strongly increases the reduction rate while maintaining or even improving the predication accuracy; (3) its fluctuation of reduction rates for different types of data sets is notably small. The efficiency of NNGIR is supported by the positive results from the experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data sets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprises a number of sensor nodes and the portable mobile device such as smartphone. It is used to monitor the physical condition and provide a reliable healthcare system. Utilizing the wireless communication network, sensor nodes collect the physiological data of one patient to the portable mobile device and the latter analyzes and transmits them to the application providers. Therefore, the personal data confidentiality and user privacy are cores of WBANs. Recently, Shen et al. presented a multi-layer authentication protocol for WBANs, which is lightweight and much easier to implement. However, we observe that their authentication between sensor nodes and the portable mobile device could ensure the forward security property only when the sensor nodes are changed (add or delete). When the sensor nodes are constant, the security property is not satisfied. Meanwhile, the authentication between the portable mobile device and application provider is prone to mutual impersonation attack, so the critical goal of mutual authentication can not be achieved. In this paper, an improved two-layer authentication scheme is proposed to remove the flaws. The analysis shows that our method is more secure and could withstand various attacks.

AB Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), one of the major active components in Astragalus membranaceus, is an effective immunomodulator used in the treatment of immunological diseases in China. However, the anti-infective action and mechanism of APS is not fully known. In the present study, we found that APS induced the expression of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37, a key host anti-infective molecule, in both mRNA and protein levels in respiratory epithelial cells HBE16 and A549. Furthermore, the lysate and supernatant from APS-treated HBE16 cells both exhibited an obvious antibacterial action, which was partially neutralizated by LL-37 monoclonal antibody. In addition, APS also significantly elevated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK and caused the degradation of IB. Specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK, or NF-B obviously abolished APS-induced LL-37 synthesis and antibacterial activity, respectively. Taken together, our results confirmed the enhancement of APS on LL-37 induction and antibacterial action in respiratory epithelial cells, which may be attributed to activation of p38 MAPK/JNK and NF-B pathways. Furthermore, these results also supported the clinical application of APS in the treatment of infectious diseases.

AB The yak (Bos grunniens), which is a unique bovine breed that is distributed mainly in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, is considered a good model for studying plateau adaptability in mammals. The lungs are important functional organs that enable animals to adapt to their external environment. However, the genetic mechanism underlying the adaptability of yak lungs to harsh plateau environments remains unknown. To explore the unique evolutionary process and genetic mechanism of yak adaptation to plateau environments, we performed transcriptome sequencing of yak and cattle (Bos taurus) lungs using RNA-Seq technology and a subsequent comparison analysis to identify the positively selected genes in the yak. After deep sequencing, a normal transcriptome profile of yak lung that containing a total of 16,815 expressed genes was obtained, and the characteristics of yak lungs transcriptome was described by functional analysis. Furthermore, Ka/Ks comparison statistics result showed that 39 strong positively selected genes are identified from yak lungs. Further GO and KEGG analysis was conducted for the functional annotation of these genes. The results of this study provide valuable data for further explorations of the unique evolutionary process of high-altitude hypoxia adaptation in yaks in the Tibetan Plateau and the genetic mechanism at the molecular level.

AB Pd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on polyaniline (PANI)-coated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized using a low-cost and simple method for application in the Heck reaction. The effects of the PANI/CNT coating weight ratio on the catalytic stability and recyclability of the composite were determined by using a combination of experimental and computational methods. The results show that through coordination of the N-species in PANI with the Pd NPs, the nitrogen-rich PANI@CNT provides a strong support for the Pd NPs. The thickness of the PANI layer is the key in determining the stability of the catalyst. PANI becomes protonated in the presence of CNTs, as electron transfer from the former to the latter creates strong interactions between the two. Thus, PANI becomes more stable in nanocomposites with a higher CNT content, e.g., PANI/CNT = 0.5 : 1. The catalyst with a PANI/CNT ratio of 0.5 : 1 exhibited the best recycling performance, and only a small loss of activity was observed after 10 cycles. However, upon increasing the PANI content (e.g., PANI/CNT = 4 : 1), the PANI units tend to form bulk structures that are less stable than those that wrap around the CNTs. Such a structure is unstable; therefore, the PANI layers can easily deform or break away from the CNT backbones. Hence, these catalysts deactivate during recycling. Thus, our study demonstrates that the assembly of noble-metal NPs on CNTs bearing a thin coaxial PANI coating is a powerful technique to prepare reusable catalysts for the Heck reaction. Coating thickness is also a key factor affecting the efficiency and stability of the catalyst.

AB A series of carboxyl-terminated hyperbranched oligomer polyester (HBP) with different degree of branching (DB) and number average molar mass ((M) over bar (n)) have been prepared. The molecular structure, degree of branching, molecular mass and its distribution of HBP were investigated by FTIR, H-1 NMR, and GPC, respectively. And the coordination number, stability constant and degree of dissociation (alpha) between HBP and chromium(III) were measured via continuous variation method (Job's plot). Experimental results show that the coordination capability between HBP and chromium(III) affected by both DB and molecular mass, and the latter plays a decisive role. Moreover HBP outperforms low molecular weight of organic acids (citric acid, acetic acid) and linear polyacrylic acid with similar molecular mass. The coordination number and stability constants of HBP-3 ((M) over bar (n) = 1713 Da, (M) over bar (w)/(M) over bar (n) (PDI) = 1.11 and DB = 0.72) can reach 4 and 6.55e+008, which demonstrated it can be selected as a good ligand to coordination with chromium(III). Therefore HBP can be used as chrome auxiliary in chrome tanning to improve the absorption of chromium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research communication describes the profile of gene expression related to the synthesis of yak milk as determined via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Significant up-regulation during lactation were observed in genes related to fatty acid (FA) uptake from blood (LPL, CD36), intracellular FA transport (FABP3), intracellular FA activation of long- and short-chain FAs (ACSS1, ACSS2, ACSL1), de novo synthesis (ACACA), desaturation (SCD), triacyglycerol (TAG) synthesis (AGPAT6, GPAM, LPIN1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, BTN1A1, XDH), ketone body utilisation (BDH1, OXCT1), and transcription regulation (THRSP, PPARGC1A). In particular, intracellular de novo FA synthesis (ACSS2, ACACA, and FABP3) and TAG synthesis (GPAM, AGPAT6, and LPIN1), whose regulation might be orchestrated as part of the gene network under the control of SERBF1 in the milk fat synthesis process, were more activated compared to levels in dairy cows. However, the genes involved in lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, XDH, and BTN1A1) were expressed at lower levels compared to those in dairy cows, where these genes are mainly controlled by the PPARG regulator.

AB (K,Na)NbO3-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with high properties have attracted great interest because of the increasing environmental concerns. In this work, a potential lead-free candidate (1-x) (K(0.4)5Na(0.55))(0.96)Li0.04Nb1-ySbyO3-xBiFeO(3) (KNLNSy-xBF) with rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T)phase boundary was systematically investigated. Benefiting from the R-T phase boundary, the enhanced electrical properties (e.g.d(33-)365 pC/N, k(p)similar to 0.503, epsilon(r) similar to 1689 and tan delta similar to 0.03) as well as high Curie temperature (T-c-370 degrees C) were obtained in the composition of y = 0.035, almost comparable to that of PZT5A (Navy II) piezoelectric ceramics. In addition, a good thermal stability of d(33) (T-c = 365 degrees C, d(33) >= 280 pC/N) was found in the ceramics with y = 0.035. We believe that the BiFeO3-modified (K, Na, Li) (Nb, Sb)O-3 lead-free ceramics with high Curie temperature is a promising candidate for piezoelectric devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Staphylococcus aureus produces a wide variety of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs, SEA to SEX), which are responsible for staphylococcalfood poisoning. This study is aimed to establish a system to detect staphylococcal enterotoxin M (SEM) protein in food matrixes. In the present study, sem gene was characterized in a S. aureus isolate H4 associated with food poisoning. The amino acid sequence of the deduced SEM protein was same as that of previously identified SEM from S. aureus 04-02981. Subsequently, mature SEM protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified with a Ni-NTA spin column. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibody against it were prepared. Using these antibodies, a highly sensitive, specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system was developed capable of detecting SEM in milk, meat and rice. Cross-reactivity with SEB, SEI and SEK in this method was insignificant. Quantification of SEM secretion invitro using this novel capture ELISA revealed that SEM was mainly secreted during the transition from the exponential to the stationary phase. Furthermore, sem gene and SEM protein production were screened by PCR and the developed ELISA system. The results indicated that there were two SEM+ strains of 19 S. aureus isolates originating in cold dishes and humans suffering from food poisoning. The investigations make it possible to assess SEM in food hygiene supervision in near future.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyStaphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) are the main causative agents of staphylococcalfood poisoning. Unlike classical SEs (SEA to SEE), the relationship between newly identified SEs (SEG to SEX) and staphylococcalfood poisoning has not been clearly elucidated. Recently, mild emetic potential of staphylococcal enterotoxin M (SEM) has been demonstrated, which indicated that SEM might be associated with food poisoning. However, there is currently no commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit available for immunological detection of it. Therefore, we developed a highly sensitive, specific sandwich ELISA system and assayed SEM in food matrixes. This assay facilitates the study of SEM expression invitro and invivo. In addition, the investigations would be helpful in addressing the relative incidence of SEM+ strains in near future.

SO OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING

DT Article
ID BANDWIDTH DEFRAGMENTATION; PATH NETWORK; ALLOCATION
AB Flex-grid optical networks (FONs) employ dynamic routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithms to support diverse services with heterogeneous bit-rates. Although these RSA algorithms can increase the flexibility and efficiency of spectrum allocation, they may also possibly induce spectrum fragments when allocating spectrum to accommodate different service requests. The generated spectrum fragments may exhaust the available spectrum resources and degrade networking performances. Therefore, many schemes referred as defragmentation algorithms have been proposed to reduce spectrum fragments at the cost of traffic disruption or extra components, which are usually required to handle the fragmented spectrum via resource re optimization. Although some grouping RSA algorithms have been proposed to prevent the generation of spectrum fragments with no traffic disruption or extra components, the pre-divided fixed spectrum groups reduce the flexibility in a dynamic spectrum assignment and thus degrade the blocking performance of the network. In this paper, we propose a RSA algorithm based on variable-grouping mechanism, namely Minimized Variable Grouping (MVG) RSA algorithm, which can not only efficiently restrain the generation of spectrum fragments, but also improve the blocking performance compared to the typical ungrouped and the conventional grouping RSA algorithms. By employing variable grouping mechanism, the proposed algorithm sorts services into different kinds according to their bandwidth requirements and then divides the spectrum resources into several variable grotips according to the kinds of services. And the generation of the spectrum fragments is restricted in the spectrum intervals between two adjacent grotips. In this way, the proposed algorithm can dramatically restrain the generation of fragments. In addition, the proposed algorithm can reduce the blocking probability by minimizing the grouped spectrum resources to maximize the remained vacant spectrum resources in the spectrum intervals between two adjacent groups for future service requests and thus helps improve the blocking performance. The simulation results show that the proposed MVG RSA algorithm can dramatically reduce the fragments with no traffic disruption while exhibiting a low blocking probability.

AB Cervical cancer presents extremely low PEDF expression which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In this study, folate receptor alpha (FR alpha)-targeted nano-liposomes (FLP) were designed to enhance the anti-tumor effect by targeting delivery of exogenous PEDF gene to cervical cancer cells. The targeting molecule F-PEG-Chol was firstly synthesized by a novel simpler method. FLP encapsulating PEDF gene (FLP/PEDF) with a typical lipid-membrane structure were prepared by a film dispersion method. The transfection experiment found FLP could effectively transfect human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells). FLP/PEDF significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC cells) and suppressed adhension, invasion and migration of HeLa cells in vitro. In the abdominal metastatic tumor model of cervical cancer, FLP/PEDF administered by intraperitoneal injection exhibited a superior anti-tumor effect probably due to the up-regulated PEDF. FLP/PEDF could not only sharply reduce the microvessel density but also dramatically inhibit proliferation and markedly induce apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, the preliminary safety investigation revealed that FLP/PEDF had no obvious toxicity. These results clearly showed that FLP were desired carriers for PEDF gene and FLP/PEDF might represent a potential novel strategy for gene therapy of cervical cancer.

AB During the past 3000 years, cattle on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau have developed adaptive phenotypes under the selective pressure of hypoxia, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and extreme cold. The genetic mechanism underlying this rapid adaptation is not yet well understood. Here, we present whole-genome resequencing data for 258 cattle from 32 cattle breeds/populations, including 89 Tibetan cattle representing eight populations distributed at altitudes ranging from 3400 m to 4300 m. Our genomic analysis revealed that Tibetan cattle exhibited a continuous phylogeographic cline from the East Asian taurine to the South Asian indicine ancestries. We found that recently selected genes in Tibetan cattle were related to body size (HMGA2 and NCAPG) and energy expenditure (DUOXA2). We identified signals of sympatric introgression from yak into Tibetan cattle at different altitudes, covering 0.64%-3.26% of their genomes, which included introgressed genes responsible for hypoxia response (EGLN1), cold adaptation (LRP11), DNA damage repair (LATS1), and UV radiation resistance (GNPAT). We observed that introgressed yak alleles were associated with noncoding variants, including those in present EGLN1. In Tibetan cattle, three yak introgressed SNPs in the EGLN1 promoter region reduced the expression of EGLN1, suggesting that these genomic variants enhance hypoxia tolerance. Taken together, our results indicated complex adaptation processes in Tibetan cattle, where recently selected genes and introgressed yak alleles jointly facilitated rapid adaptation to high-altitude environments.

TI Inhibition of α-amylase activity by quercetin via multi-spectroscopic
   and molecular docking approaches

DT Article
DE Quercetin; Inhibition mechanism; alpha-Amylase; Molecular docking
ID POLYPHENOLS
AB The quercetin-induced inhibition of alpha-amylase activity was comprehensively studied using various spectroscopic methods, including UV-Visible, fluorescence, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Quercetin acted as a mixed-type inhibitor, and its binding altered the kinetic properties of alpha-amylase. Quercetin exhibited static binding with alpha-amylase, as evidenced by a higher Stern-Volmer constant (KSV) K SV ) at 298 K (9.56 +/- 0.63 x 103 3 L/ mol) compared to the K SV value at 318 K (5.56 +/- 0.48 x 103 3 L/mol). Additionally, quercetin induced conformational changes in the hydrophobic micro-environment surrounding the tryptophan and tyrosine residues of alpha-amylase, as indicated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Hydrophobic interactions primarily drove the spontaneous binding between alpha-amylase and quercetin from thermodynamic data. Molecular docking studies supported the role of hydrogen bonds (Asp197 and Gln63) and hydrophobic interactions (with active site residues Ala198, Leu165, and Trp59) in the complex formation. These findings provide a detailed understanding of how quercetin inhibits alpha-amylase activity, reinforcing its potential as a glycemic controller in food formulations.

AB Sour meat is a highly appreciated traditional fermented product, mainly from the Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces. The flavor profiles of sour meat from goose and pork were evaluated using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) combined with an electronic nose (E-nose) and tongue (E-tongue). A total of 94 volatile compounds were characterized in fermented sour meat from both pork and goose using GC-IMS. A data-mining protocol based on univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the source of the raw meat plays a crucial role in the formation of flavor compounds during the fermentation process. In detail, sour meat from pork contained higher levels of hexyl acetate, sotolon, heptyl acetate, butyl propanoate, hexanal, and 2-acetylpyrrole than sour goose meat. In parallel, sour meat from goose showed higher levels of 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one, n-butyl lactate, 2-butanol, (E)-2-nonenal, and decalin than sour pork. In terms of the odor and taste response values obtained by the E-nose and E-tongue, a robust principal component model (RPCA) could effectively differentiate sour meat from the two sources. The present work could provide references to investigate the flavor profiles of traditional sour meat products fermented from different raw meats and offer opportunities for a rapid identification method based on flavor profiles.

AB Wooden building materials have advantages in terms of biodegradability, non-toxicity, pollution-free and recycling. Currently, applications of natural wood are extremely limited because of low density, low strength and toughness. Therefore, we reported an effective modification strategy with nano-scale cellulose nanofibrils design to prepare a synergistically enhanced cellulosic material. Via three steps: i) the secondary alcohol hydroxyl groups in C2, C3 position were cut; ii) oxidize the hydroxyl group at C2, C3 position to achieve dialdehyde cel-lulose; and iii) oxidized again to obtain dicarboxylic cellulose. Subsequently, thanks to the regulation of the average moisture content, the moisture content in the wood surface and subsurface increased in a short time. The wood softening layer contributes to the hotpressing treatment of the wood. The mechanical properties and dimensionality have been greatly improved. The obtained delignified oxidated hot-pressed wood with 0.55 mmol/g carboxyl group content demonstrates excellent strength of 328.8 +/- 7.43 MPa and Young's modulus of 8.1 +/- 0.14 GPa, which is twice than that of natural wood. Delignified oxidated hot-pressed wood also shows exceptional toughness of 8.3 +/- 0.28 MJ/m3. Other than that, the shore hardness indicates 0.55 mmol/g car-boxylic group, which could increase the hardness at the wood surface hardness to 72.5 +/- 4.29 degrees.

AB With the rapid development of metal-organic frameworks (MOF), the toxicity and environmental safety of MOF materials should be thoroughly investigated. The behaviors and bio-effects of MOF materials after oral exposure are largely unknown. In this study, we performed a pilot toxicity evaluation of MOF-74(Co) nanoparticles (NPs) both in vitro and in vivo. The cell viability and cell cycle were monitored after LO2 cells were incubated with MOF-74(Co). The Co contents, bodyweight, serum biochemistry, histopathological changes, and oxidative stress parameters were measured after oral exposure to MOF-74(Co) NPs in mice. LO2 cells showed viability loss at 100 mg/L. The cell cycle arrest was more sensitive, which was observed even at 12.5 mg/L. MOF-74(Co) NPs led to a significant accumulation of Co in the liver and kidneys. No bodyweight loss was observed and the serum biochemical index was mainly unchanged. Except for slight inflammation, the histopathological images of the liver and kidneys after oral exposure to MOF-74(Co) NPs were normal compared to the control. Meaningful oxidative stress was found in the liver and kidneys. The results collectively indicated the low toxicity of MOF-74(Co) NPs after oral exposure in mice.

AB In this paper, we address the extended dissipativity (ED) performance of delayed T-S fuzzy model (TSFM)-based wind generation systems (WGSs). First, a concept of coupled leakage time-varying delay (CLTVD) is proposed to construct a more widespread TSFM. Second, the relaxed term with time-delay-product function (TDPF) is introduced. Then, a befitting Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed, which can handle the delay and its derivation. Third, by using valid integral inequalities, new stabilization criteria are established. Meanwhile, the desired fuzzy quantized control with CLTVD is designed. Finally, simulation results are given to show the validity and superiority of our derived results. (C) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Classification Model Based on
   Cross-Feature Generation by Convolution Neural Network: Model
   Development and Validation
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article

ID INTELLIGENT SYNDROME DIFFERENTIATION
AB Background: Nowadays, intelligent medicine is gaining widespread attention, and great progress has been made in Western medicine with the help of artificial intelligence to assist in decision making Compared with Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) involves selecting the specific treatment method, prescription, and medication based on the dialectical results of each patient's symptoms. For this reason, the development of a TCM-assisted decision-making system has lagged. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is the core of TCM treatment; TCM doctors can dialectically classify diseases according to patients' symptoms and optimize treatment in time. Therefore, the essence of a TCM-assisted decision-making system is a TCM intelligent, dialectical algorithm. Symptoms stored in electronic medical records are mostly associated with patients' diseases; however, symptoms of TCM are mostly subjectively identified. In general electronic medical records, there are many missing values. TCM medical records, in which symptoms tend to cause high-dimensional sparse data, reduce algorithm accuracy.
   Objective: This study aims to construct an algorithm model compatible for the multidimensional, highly sparse, and multiclassification task of TCM syndrome differentiation, so that it can be effectively applied to the intelligent dialectic of different diseases.
   Methods: The relevant terms in electronic medical records were standardized with respect to symptoms and evidence-based criteria of TCM. We structuralized case data based on the classification of different symptoms and physical signs according to the 4 diagnostic examinations in TCM diagnosis. A novel cross-feature generation by convolution neural network model performed evidence-based recommendations based on the input embedded, structured medical record data.
   Results: The data set included 5273 real dysmenorrhea cases from the Sichuan TCM big data management platform and the Chinese literature database, which were embedded into 60 fields after being structured and standardized. The training set and test set were randomly constructed in a ratio of 3:1. For the classification of different syndrome types, compared with 6 traditional, intelligent dialectical models and 3 click-through-rate models, the new model showed a good generalization ability and good classification effect. The comprehensive accuracy rate reached 96.21%.
   Conclusions: The main contribution of this study is the construction of a new intelligent dialectical model combining the characteristics of TCM by treating intelligent dialectics as a high-dimensional sparse vector classification task. Owing to the standardization of the input symptoms, all the common symptoms of TCM are covered, and the model can differentiate the symptoms with a variety of missing values. Therefore, with the continuous improvement of disease data sets, this model has the potential to be applied to the dialectical classification of different diseases in TCM.

ID PROTECTED AREAS
AB China's forests were severely degraded by human activities during the latter half of the 20th century. Therefore, China enacted ambitious programs of natural forest protection and afforestation to protect and expand forests. Yet it is unclear how the programs, especially the designation of forest reserves, have affected forest cover and fragmentation. We evaluated the effectiveness of China's national forest reserves designated since 1990 in conserving forests, by analyzing four forest metrics (i.e., percentage forest cover, mean forest patch size, mean forest patch radius of gyration, and forest patch cohesion index) derived from a newly produced 30 m annual China land cover dataset from 1990 to 2019. We found that overall forest cover increased and fragmentation decreased from baseline years, when reserves were designated, to 2019 in both reserves and their surrounding areas, and only the increase in forest cover relative to baseline was significantly greater in reserves than in surrounding areas. The designation time of reserves under national protection had no considerable effect on changes in the four metrics, but for zonation, the core zone showed a significantly higher increase in forest patch cohesion index relative to baseline than the buffer and transition zones. Nevertheless, forest cover declined and fragmentation increased in highly forested reserves, suggesting destructive human activities and ineffective management. Thus, forest protection and regeneration programs were moderately successful. We recommend that there is significant improvement needed to ensure greater protection of existing forests and reduction of threats to promote effective management.

ID OUTPUT-FEEDBACK CONTROL; STABILITY; BOUNDEDNESS; DESIGN
AB This paper is concerned with the H-infinity control problem of the nonlinear asynchronous switched system in the presence of mixed time-varying delays and exogenous disturbance by employing the controller mode-dependent dynamic event-triggered strategy, merging switching signal approach and average dwell time scheme. Firstly, instead of using the static event-triggered scheme, a novel Zeno-free controller mode-dependent dynamic event-triggered strategy is designed to reduce the unnecessary costs of the system operation. Then, the dynamic event-triggered asynchronous control behaviours between the subsystems and the corresponding controllers are studied. Some suitable sufficient conditions are derived by applying the merging switching signal approach and multiple Lyapunov functional method to guarantee the H(infinity )performance of the nonlinear asynchronous delayed switched system. Finally, the feasibility and the application of the obtained results are illustrated by a numerical example and a practical example. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Selenium (Se) plays a crucial role in intestinal health. However, the specific mechanism by which deficiency of Se causes intestinal damage remains unclear. This study was to explore whether Se deficiency can cause ER stress and induce apoptosis in swine small intestine. We established the Se deficiency swine model in vivo and the intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cell Se deficiency model in vitro. The results of morphological observation showed that Se deficiency caused structural damage in intestinal villi and the decrease of goblet cell structure. The apoptotic characteristics such as nucleolar condensation, mitochondrial swelling, and apoptotic bodies were observed in the IPEC-J2 cells. The results of acridine orange/ethidium bromide and mitochondrial membrane potential fluorescence staining in vitro showed that there were more apoptotic cells in the Se-deficiency group than that in the control group. The protein and/or mRNA expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, cytc, PERK, ATF6, IRE, XBP1, CHOP, GRP78, which are related to ER stress-apoptosis pathway, were significantly increased in the Se-deficient group which compared with the control group in vivo and in vitro were consistent. These results indicated that Se deficiency induced ER stress and increased the apoptosis in swine small intestine and IPEC-J2 cells and then caused the damage in swine small intestinal tissue. Besides, the results of gene expressions in our experiment proved that ER stress induced by Se deficiency promoted apoptosis. These results filled the blank in the mechanism of Se deficiency-induced intestinal injury in swine.

AB Cancer vaccines represent among the most promising strategies in the battle against cancers. However, the clinical efficacy of current cancer vaccines is largely limited by the lack of optimized delivery systems to generate strong and persistent antitumor immune responses. Moreover, most cancer vaccines require multiple injections to boost the immune responses, leading to poor patient compliance. Controlled-release drug delivery systems are able to address these issues by presenting drugs in a controlled spatiotemporal manner, which allows co-delivery of multiple drugs, reduction of dosing frequency and avoidance of significant systemic toxicities. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer vaccines including subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, dendritic cell-based vaccines, tumor cell-based vaccines and in situ vaccines. Furthermore, we highlight the efforts and challenges of controlled or sustained release drug delivery systems (e.g., microparticles, scaffolds, injectable gels, and microneedles) in ameliorating the safety, effectiveness and operability of cancer vaccines. Finally, we briefly discuss the correlations of vaccine release kinetics and the immune responses to enlighten the rational design of the next-generation platforms for cancer therapy.

   PATTERNS
AB Understanding how net primary production (NPP) and its allocation respond to climate warming is of fundamental importance in predicting ecosystem carbon (C) cycle and C-climate feedback. Especially, the optimal partitioning theory suggests that plants preferentially allocate photosynthates toward the above- or below-ground parts to acquire the limiting resources to maximize their growth rate and optimize resource use under environmental change. However, it remains elusive on how NPP allocation changes and regulates community water-use efficiency (WUEc) under climate warming. In this study, we conducted a manipulative warming experiment with three levels of warming treatments (control, + 1.5 degrees C and + 2.5 degrees C) to explore the response of NPP allocation and its regulation on WUEc in an alpine meadow. Results showed that above-ground NPP (ANPP) and below-ground NPP (BNPP) responded differently to warming. On average, W1.5 (+ 1.5 degrees C) and W2.5 (+ 2.5 degrees C) treatments increased BNPP by 28.98% and 33.28% and increased NPP by 20.05% and 38.70%, respectively, across 4 years. Whereas no consistent warming effect on ANPP was observed across years. The fraction of BNPP to total NPP (f(BNPP)) responded positively to warming under low ambient temperature and community biomass while it responded negatively under high ambient temperature and community biomass. Notably warming-induced changes in f(BNPP)negatively correlated with warming-induced changes in WUEc. These results suggested that warming effect on NPP allocation was largely contextually dependent and implied important biological regulation on WUEc. The emerging trade-offs between NPP allocation and WUEc reflect adaptation strategy of plant community under climate change.

AB Simple Summary SelectingBacillus amyloliquefaciensandBacillus pumilusin the present work, antibiotic substitutes were found for weaned black goat health and growth. This study indicated thatBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 andBacillus pumilusfsznc-09 improved the development of rumen and small intestine in weanling Jintang black goats. They also regulated microbial communities by increasing the richness of beneficial bacteria, but decreasing that of pathogenic bacteria in rumen and caecum for nutrient metabolism and promoting healthy conditions. The importance ofBacillusas feed additives in animals' production is well recognized.Bacillus amyloliquefaciensandBacillus pumilusare involved in promoting animal growth performance and immunological indicators. However, their precise roles in the modulation of microbiota and immune response in goat rumen and intestines have not been investigated. The aim of the current work was to evaluate the impacts ofBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 andBacillus pumilusfsznc-09 in the development of rumen and small intestinal and microbial communities in rumen and caecum of weanling Jintang black goats. Morphological alterations of rumen and small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) were evaluated by histochemical staining, and ruminal contents and cecal feces were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing in an Illumina NovaSeq platform. Morphological analysis showed that feeding weanling goats withBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 orBacillus pumilusfsznc-09 enhanced ruminal papilla and small intestinal villus growth. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that microbial richness and diversity (Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, and ACE) and the relative richness of multiple or potential beneficial bacteria were higher in weaned black goats fed onBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 orBacillus pumilusfsznc-09, but that of multiple or potentially pathogenic bacteria were lower, as compared with the control group. Tax4Fun analysis predicting the functional profiling of microbial communities showed that microbial communities in rumen or caecum were highly influential on metabolism and organism systems after feeding weanling goats withBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 orBacillus pumilusfsznc-09. It was suggested thatBacillus amyloliquefaciensfsznc-06 andBacillus pumilusfsznc-09 might be an auspicious antibiotic alternative to improve black goat growth and health by changing rumen and gut microbiota positively.

AB Particle-stabilized emulsions that can respond to external stimuli have attracted significant concerns due to their intelligent-controlled stability, whereas particle-stabilized Pickering emulsions responding to multistimuli but based on biomass have been rarely reported. Here, a multistimuli-responsive Pickering emulsion was developed using the modified chitosan as stabilizer. Due to electrostatic attraction, Se-containing anionic surfactant, sodium 11-(butylselenyl)undecylsulfate (C4SeC11S), can bind with CS at an acidic pH and form CS-C4SeC11S complexes which can further self-associate to form micrometer-sized particles with the character of partially hydrophobicity. Therefore, at pH < pK(a), an oil-in-water Pickering emulsion can be formed using CS-C4SeC11S particles as stabilizers and can spontaneously respond to redox, ion, and pH. First, with the addition of oxidation, the hydrophilicity of C4SeC11S was enhanced, and thus, hydrophobic association of CS-C4SeC11S decreased, leading to the disruption of CS-C4SeC11S particles. Hence, the emulsion destabilized. The demulsification process is closely related with the dosage of oxidant and the oxidation time. Second, introduction of a competitive ion (e.g., CTAB) could break the binding between C4SeC11S and CS, leading to the disruption of particle emulsifier. Thereby, demulsification occurred. Third, with sequentially increasing/decreasing pH, the emulsion can be switched from stable to unstable and then to stable again accordingly. Such a unique pH-responsive behavior has never been discovered in other pH-responsive Pickering emulsions. All of the stimuli-responsive behaviors were reversible. Upon alternately adding oxidant/reductant, CTAB/C4SeC11S, or base/acid, the current emulsion can be reversibly switched off (destabilization) and on (stabilization). Such a Pickering emulsion may be a good candidate as a vehicle of functional ingredient.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP, a natural glucomannan material) for the development of a gastroretentive drug delivery system for the first time. Novel BSP-based porous wafer was prepared for levofloxacin hydrochloride (LFH) delivery by combining floating, swelling, and mucoadhesion mechanisms. The influences of BSP and ethyl cellulose (EC) on drug release and mucoadhesive strength were studied by 3(2) factorial design. The optimized matrix was coated with polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun membrane by electrospinning and heat treatment technology. The optimized formula (F6, coated) exhibited Q(4 h) of 41.20 +/- 1.90%, Q(8 h) of 76.49 +/- 1.69%, and mucoadhesive strength of 86.11 +/- 1.33 gf, and its drug release profile most closely resembled the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with anomalous diffusion driving mechanism. F6 (coated) also presented excellent buoyancy, preferred swelling characteristic due to the porous structure formed by freeze-drying. Meanwhile, the internal morphology, physical state, drug-excipient compatibility, and thermal behavior were recorded. The negligible cytotoxicity of F6 (coated) was observed in human gastric epithelial cell cultures. In the in vitro antimicrobial experiment, the prepared wafer exhibited obvious bacterial inhibition zone, and due to its longer gastric retention, the wafer also performed a more effective Helicobacter pylori clearance than free LFH in vivo.

AB Dispositional optimism reflects one's generalized positive expectancies for future outcomes and plays a crucial role in personal developmental outcomes and health (e.g., counteracting related mental disorders such as depression and anxiety). Increasing evidence has suggested that extraversion is an important personality factor contributing to dispositional optimism. However, less is known about the association between dispositional optimism and brain structure and the role of extraversion in this association. Here, we examined these issues in 231 healthy high school students aged 16 to 20years (110 males, mean age = 18.48years, SD = 0.54) by estimating regional gray matter density (rGMD) using a voxel-based morphometry method via structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain regression analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between dispositional optimism and the rGMD of the bilateral putamen after adjusting for age, sex, family socioeconomic status (SES), general intelligence, and total gray matter volume (TGMV). Moreover, prediction analyses using fourfold balanced cross-validation combined with linear regression confirmed a significant connection between dispositional optimism and putamen density after adjusting for age, sex, and family SES. More importantly, subsequent mediation analysis showed that extraversion may account for the association between putamen density and dispositional optimism after adjusting for age, sex, family SES, general intelligence, TGMV, and the other four Big Five personality traits. Taken together, the current study provides new evidence regarding the neurostructural basis underlying dispositional optimism in adolescents and underscores the importance of extraversion as an essential personality factor for dispositional optimism acquisition.

AB A series of benzothiazinones (BTZs) containing an oxime moiety, based on the structure of ZR-10 discovered in our lab, were designed and synthesized. Most of the compounds with alkoxyimino groups attached to the piperazine or cyclohexyl ring of PBTZ169, exhibit excellent in vitro activity against both drug-sensitive and clinically isolated multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains (MIC: < 0.016-0.037 mu g/mL) and low cell cytotoxicity. Two close PBTZ169-analogues 3a and 3b with proper ADME/T and PK properties show potent in vivo efficacy in an acute mouse model of tuberculosis. Compound 3a is under evaluation as a potential clinical candidate for treatment of tuberculosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Extraversion is a fundamental personality dimension closely related to an individual's life outcomes and mental health. Although an increasing number of studies have attempted to identify the neurostructural markers of extraversion, the results have been highly inconsistent. The current study aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of brain gray matter (GM) correlates of extraversion with a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. Our review showed relatively high interstudy heterogeneity among previous findings. Our meta-analysis of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry studies revealed that extraversion was stably associated with six core brain regions. Additionally, meta-regression analyses identified brain regions where the associations of extraversion with GM volume were modulated by gender and age. The relationships between extraversion and GM structures were discussed based on three extraversion-related functional systems. Furthermore, we explained the gender and age effects. Overall, our study is the first to reveal a comprehensive picture of brain GM correlates of extraversion, and the findings may be useful for the selection of targeted brain areas for extraversion interventions.

AB This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of mycotoxins in industry-submitted cool-season barley and wheat grown under low heat unit climate conditions. Seventy-two barley samples and 83 wheat samples were submitted by producers and industry from May 2016 to May 2017. The concentrations of twelve common mycotoxins, including nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN), alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZAL), beta-zearalenol (beta-ZAL), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), T-2 toxin (T-2), HT-2 toxin (HT-2), and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), were determined using the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. Mycotoxins were detected in 40 barley (56%) and 35 wheat (42%) samples submitted by producers and industry. DON showed the highest incidence in barley (44%) and wheat (33%). None of the barley samples contained detectable DAS and no wheat samples tested positive for alpha-ZAL, DAS, T-2, or AFB1. Co-occurrence of DON and other mycotoxins was frequently observed. Among the mycotoxin-positive samples, 70% of barley samples and 54% of wheat samples were co-contaminated with at least two mycotoxins. Four barley (6%) and five wheat (6%) samples contained levels of DON above 1000 mu g/kg (regulatory level in diets for lactating dairy animals) and HT-2 content in five barley (7%) and four wheat (5%) samples exceeded 100 mu g/kg (regulatory level in diets for cattle and poultry). Overall, contamination of these mycotoxins was more frequent and more severe in barley in comparison with wheat that was submitted by producers and industry. Comprehensive strategies, including the prevention of Fusarium toxins contamination, the routine monitoring of their prevalence, the detoxification of them in feed and food, as well as the inhibition of their absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, are highly required. A rapid detection method needs to be developed to screen mycotoxins in industry-submitted cool-season cereal grains.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion of stevioside on feed intake, feeding behavior, nutrient digestion, rumen fermentation, and serum biochemical parameters in goats. Nine male Xiangdong black goats (21.8 +/- 1.5 kg of body weight) were used in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square. All goats were fed a basal diet including concentrate and forage (chopped rice straw). The three treatments were 0, 400, or 800 mg stevioside per kg chopped rice straw on a dry matter (DM) basis. Dry matter intake of forage and total diet linearly increased (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04) with increasing stevioside in the diet. There was no effect (p > 0.05) of stevioside inclusion in the diets on eating time, rumination time, or total mastication time for the goats. Total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration in the rumen responded quadratically (p < 0.01), decreasing from 0 to 400 mg/kg stevioside inclusion and increasing thereafter. The inclusion of steviosid in the diets promoted a quadratic increase in the apparent total tract digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (p = 0.02) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (p = 0.01). Based on the results of this experiment, it could be concluded that supplementing goat diets with stevioside at 400 mg/kg to 800 mg/kg forage (about 270 to 541 mg/kg diet) resulted in increased dry intake of forage and total diet, suggesting that stevioside has positive potential as a feed additive to improve feed intake.

AB Accumulated experimental evidence indicated that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) could form biologically relevant oligomers and hetero-oligomers possess different functional properties from monomers and homo-oligomers, for example, unique pharmacology. However, the urgent lack of crystal structures of the GPCR oligomers results in very limited knowledge about their structural and functional mechanisms. In this work, we utilized a multiscale simulation strategy coupled with principal component analysis, correlation analysis and a protein structure network to study the hetero-dimerization of the -OR and -OR. We probed the cooperative mechanism involved in their activations, the allosteric communication pathways, the impact of the interface and differences from the -OR homodimer. The result indicates that TM1-TM2-H8 is a stable interface, but some residues of TM7 also participate in the dimer interface. Similar to the homodimer, the hetero-dimerization of the two inactive receptors would enhance the constitutive activation of one subunit but weaken that of the other subunit, both presenting a negative cooperativity. However, in contrast to the homodimer, the hetero-dimerization of the active protomer with the inactive one would weaken the constitutive activation of the inactive unit but maintain the activity of the active subunit. In addition, the hetero-dimerization and the activation of one subunit could significantly alter the types and the numbers of residues participating in the allosteric pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein region and the pathway between two subunits. Some important residues were identified, which play important roles in modulating activations and cooperativity between two subunits. The observations from this work indicate that the negative cooperativity should be a common feature for the homodimers and the heterodimers, but the cooperative results would be significantly different between them, depending on the activated extent of one subunit.

AB Nowadays, the potential scope of nanotechnology in uro-oncology (cancers of the prostate, bladder, and kidney) is broad, ranging from drug delivery, prevention, and diagnosis to treatment. Novel drug delivery methods using magnetic nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and polymeric nanoparticles have been investigated in prostate cancer. Additionally, renal cancer treatment may be profoundly influenced by applications of nanotechnology principles. Various nanoparticle-based strategies for kidney cancer therapy have been proposed. Partly due to the dilution of drug concentrations by urine production, causing inadequate drug delivery to tumor cells in the treatment of bladder cancer, various multifunctional bladder-targeted nanoparticles have been developed to enhance therapeutic efficiency. In each of these cancer research fields, nanotechnology has shown several advantages over widely used traditional methods. Different types of nanoparticles improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs, and multifunctional nanoparticles have good specificity toward prostate, renal, and bladder cancer. Moreover, nanotechnology can also combine with other novel technologies to further enhance effectivity. As our understanding of nanotechnologies grows, additional opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment of urological cancer are excepted to arise. In this review, we focus on nanotechnologies with potential applications in urological cancer therapy and highlight clinical areas that would benefit from nanoparticle therapy.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin that causes immunosuppression, especially in swine. Selenium (Se) is essential for proper functioning of the immune system in animals. However, little is known about the effects of DON and Se on cytokine or immunoglobulin production in piglets. Here, we addressed this gap by examining piglet splenic lymphocyte responses in vitro. Cells were stimulated with concanavalin A, a T cell stimulatory lectin, in the absence or presence of DON (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mu g/mL), Se (Na2SeO3, 2 mu M), or combinations of Se 2 mu M and DON 0.1-0.8 mu g/mL for 12, 24, or 48 h. At each time point, supernatants and cells were collected and the expression of cytokine and immunoglobulin protein and mRNA was examined. Compared with control and Se-alone treatments, DON exposure significantly and dose dependently decreased the expression levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, IgG, and IgM mRNA and protein. By contrast, co-treatment with DON + Se significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of all factors examined, except IL-4 and IL-6, compared with DON treatment alone. The results of this investigation demonstrate that Se has the potential to counteract DON-induced immunosuppression in piglets and is a promising treatment for DON-mediated toxicity.

AB Developing highly active, low-cost and organic surfactants-free Pd-based catalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is now critically important for direct ethanol fuel cells. Herein, surface-clean low-doped PdB/C catalysts (typically ca. 1.5 at% of B) are successfully prepared in an aqueous condition without adding any organic surfactants. TEM characterization shows that as-prepared low-doped PdB nanoparticles are evenly distributed on carbon support. Cyclic voltommagrams of as-prepared low-doped PdB/C in 0.5 M NaOH + 1 M C2H5OH indicate that its onset oxidation potential of ethanol is ca. 80-120 mV more negative than that on commercial Pd/C. Meanwhile, the EOR mass activity of our home-made catalysts is up to 4018 mA.mg(-1) Pd. Moreover, the durability on low-doped PdB/C catalysts is at most 2 times higher than that on commercial Pd/C. Geometric and electronic effects are adopted to understand the above mentioned enhancement of activity and durability. This work may provide a facile, low-cost and green strategy on preparing electrocatalysts toward EOR in alkaline media.

AB Neboviruses and genogroup III noroviruses (NoVsGIII) are causative agents of calf diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of neboviruses and noroviruses in cattle in China. Twenty-eight diarrhea fecal samples collected from 5 different farms were analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that 3 nebovirus positive samples were detected on 2 farms, with two strains being related to Bo/DijonA216/06/FR strain and the other one clustering with NB-like strains. Meanwhile, 3 norovirus positive samples were detected on 3 farms, all of which belonged to genotype 1. Our results confirmed the presence of neboviruses and NoVsGIII in China for the first time, and supported the presence of a novel "DijonA216-like" nebovirus genotype.

AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing a mechanism under a bilateral asymmetric information structure. More specifically, we consider a supply chain consisting of one risk-neural manufacturer and one risk-averse retailer, they have private information regarding the manufacturing costs and degree of risk aversion, respectively. We firstly construct a model under the bilateral information asymmetry using the M-V approach. We then provide a wholesale price contract under bilateral information asymmetry to examine if the true information is revealed. We find that the manufacturer and the retailer overstate their information to gain more individual profit. To achieve the coordination, we propose an innovative coordinating contract mechanism, which contains the trading quantity, the transfer payments, and the profit allocation rules. With this coordinating contract, the manufacturer and the retailer announce their true private information and maximize their expected individual profit as well as the supply chain's profit. We find that the private information of risk aversion degree doesn't affect the supply chain performance under the coordinating contract. Further, the implementation of the contract is relevant to the two parties' profits and to the difference between the expected value of information and the true information. Finally, the numerical examples are presented to illustrate the main results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The population of plateau zokor (Myospalax baileyi) has markedly increased on the degraded alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Zokors build mounds that alter plant and soil nutrients as well as biotic communities. This study explored changes in biotic and abiotic features of the community on zokor mounds of different ages (one year, and five-six year, referred to as ZM-1, and ZM-5-6) and undisturbed alpine meadow (CM) in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Significant difference of four plant functional groups on the CM, ZM-1 and ZM-5-6 indicated the grass and sedge plants have led the recovery, and the forb plants lag behind the legumes in the process of restoration in disturbed alpine meadow. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified that variance in soil microbial communities are mainly explained by the interacting effects of soil physicochemical properties and plant community characteristics. The results also demonstrate that influence of zokors on alpine meadow restoration is complex. While it is clear that intermediate concentrations of zokors appear to enhance the recovery process, it is also clear that the positive feedback between degradation and zokor population dynamics can lead to zokor population levels that cause degradation and retard recovery. A management challenge then becomes how to maintain these intermediate zokor populations and thus maximize meadow recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The kidding rate is one of the most important economic traits for goat production, but the genetic mechanism that is associated with ovulation rate is poorly understood. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) influence ovarian biological processes. The present study provides the first comparison of the ovarian miRNAs of prolific Jintang black goats (JTGs) and non-prolific Tibetan goats (TBGs) during the follicular phase using RNA-Seq technology. We generated 11.19 million (M) and 11.34 M clean reads from the TBG and JTG libraries, respectively, from which a total of 389 known miRNAs were identified and 142 novel miRNAs were predicted. A total of 191 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two breeds. Among the 10 most abundant miRNAs, miR-21-5p was defined as differentially expressed miRNA with a higher level in the JTG library than in the TBG library, but the other miRNAs were not different between the breeds. The predicted miRNA-targeted genes were further analyzed by Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses. The results revealed that miR-21, miR-99a, miRNA-143, let-7f, miR-493 and miR-200b may affect follicular development. These findings will increase the current understanding of the role of ovarian miRNAs in the regulation of ovulation rate in goats.

AB Hemoplasmas belong to Mycoplasmataceae (Mollicutes: Mycoplasmatales) and are able to infect a broad range of mammalian species. We investigated prevalence of hemotropic mycoplasma species in pig farms in the region of Zhejiang by a PCR scheme using universal primers targeting 16S rRNA and RNase P RNA gene (rnpB). Representative positive samples from different farms were selected for sequencing of 16S rRNA and the 219bp rnpB gene fragments for phylogenetic analysis. Sequencing analysis of PCR products from first samples identified a novel hemoplasma species present in several pig farms in the region with highest nucleotide identity of 92% to Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis. A duplex PCR assay was then designed for differential detection of the novel hemoplasma from Mycoplasma parvum/M. suis in field samples. Of 324 blood samples from clinically healthy pigs, 26.5% was positive for this novel hemoplasma species and 50% positive for M. suis/M. parvum, indicating that the novel hemotropic mycoplasma species were of considerably high prevalence in Zhejiang province, China.

AB A series of tocopherol-based cationic lipid 3a-3f bearing a pH-sensitive imidazole moiety in the dipeptide headgroup and a reduction-responsive disulfide linkage were designed and synthesized. Acidbase titration of these lipids showed good buffering capacities. The liposomes formed from 3 and co-lipid 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) could efficiently bind and condense DNA into nanoparticles. Gel binding and HPLC assays confirmed the encapsulated DNA could release from lipoplexes 3 upon addition of 10 mM glutathione (GSH). MTT assays in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that lipoplexes 3 had low cytotoxicity. The in vitro gene transfection studies showed cationic dipeptide headgroups clearly affected the transfection efficiency (TE), and arginine-histidine based dipeptide lipid 3f give the best TE, which was 30.4 times higher than Lipofectamine 3000 in the presence of 10% serum. Cell-uptake assays indicated that basic amino acid containing dipeptide cationic lipids exhibited more efficient cell uptake than serine and aromatic amino acids based dipeptide lipids. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies corroborated that 3 could efficiently deliver and release DNA into the nuclei of HeLa cells. These results suggest that tocopherol-based dipeptide cationic lipids with pH and reduction dual-sensitive characteristics might be promising non-viral gene delivery vectors.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-expressing Saccharomyces cerevisiae on duodenal development in weaned piglets. In total, forty piglets weaned at 21-26 d of age were assigned to one of the five groups that were provided basic diet (control group) or diet supplemented with S. cerevisiae expressing either empty-vector (INVSc1(EV) group), tagged EGF (T-EGF) (INVSc1-TE(-) group), extracellular EGF (EE-EGF) (INVSc1-EE(+) group) or intracellular EGF (IE-EGF) (INVSc1-IE(+) group). All treatments were delivered as 60.00 mu g/kg body weight EGF/d. On 0, 7, 14 and 21 d, eight piglets per treatment were sacrificed to analyse the morphology, activities and mRNA expressions of digestive enzymes, as well as Ig levels (IgA, IgM, IgG) in duodenal mucosa. The results showed significant improvement on 7, 14 and 21 d, with respect to average daily gain (P < 0.05), mucosa morphology (villus height and crypt depth) (P < 0 . 05), Ig levels (P < 0.01), activities and mRNA expressions of digestive enzymes (creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and sucrase) (P < 0.05) and the mRNA expression of EGF-receptor (P < 0.01) in NVSc1-TE(-), INVSc1-EE(+) and INVSc1-IE(+) groups compared with control and INVSc1(EV) groups. In addition, a trend was observed in which the INVSc1-IE(+) group showed an improvement in Ig levels (0.05 < P < 0.10), mRNA expressions of digestive enzymes and EGF-receptor (P < 0.05) compared with NVSc1-TE(-) and INVSc1-EE(+) groups. These results indicate that supplementing recombinant EGF-expressing S. cerevisiae to the diet of weaned piglets enhanced duodenal development. Moreover, biological activity (Ig levels, mRNA expressions of digestive enzymes and EGF-receptor) of IE-EGF was better than either EE-EGF or T-EGF.

AB The oxidized amyloses with high oxidation level and carboxyl content were successfully prepared through a two-step oxidation method using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant and copper sulfate as the catalyst. The results showed that oxidation would prevent the oxidized product to crystallize and induce depolymerization of amylose molecules. Accordingly, the helices and inclusion capacity of oxidized amylose molecules were reduced. However, the solubility of oxidized amyloses in water was highly improved due to the introduced carboxyl groups. The solution stability of oxidized amylose-guest inclusion complexes in aqueous solution was efficiently improved to a large extent. The result suggested that the two-step oxidation method was an efficient way to highly broaden the applications of amylose-guest inclusion complexes in water environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The symptoms and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) are complicated and an accurate diagnosis of PD is difficult, particularly in early-stage. Because functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is non-invasive and is characterized by the integration of different brain areas in terms of functional connectivity (FC), fMRI has been widely used in PD research. Non-motor symptom (NMS) features are also frequently present in PD before the onset of classical motor symptoms with pain as the primary NMS. Considering that PD could affect the pain process at multiple levels, we hypothesized that pain is one of the earliest symptoms in PD and investigated whether FC of the pain network was disrupted in PD without pain. To better understand the pathogenesis of pain in PD, we combined resting state and pain-stimuli-induced task state fMRI to identify alterations in FC related to pain in PD.
   Methods: Fourteen early drug-naive PD without pain and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in our testing task. We used independent component analysis to select seven functional networks related to PD and pain. We focused on abnormalities in FC and in functional network connectivity (FNC) in PD compared with HC during the task (51 degrees C heat pain stimuli) and at rest.
   Results: Compared with HC, PD showed decreased FC in putamen within basal ganglia network (BGN) in task state and decreased FC in putamen of salience network (SN) and mid-cingulate cortex of sensorimotor network in rest state. FNC between the BGN and the SN are reduced during both states in PD compared with HC. In addition, right frontoparietal network (RFPN), which is considered as a bridge between the SN and default-mode network, was significantly disturbed during the task.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that BGN plays a role in the pathological mechanisms of pain underlying PD, and RFPN likely contributes greatly to harmonization between intrinsic brain activity and external stimuli.

AB The advanced oxidation process induced by photocatalysis under visible light undoubtedly possesses greater application potential and cost-effectiveness due to the high excitation energy supply costs. Here, we proposed a novel Type-II heterojunction Se-g-C3N4/ZnO (Se-CN/ZnO) and MnCo2O4 (MCO) photocatalyst for the efficient degradation of levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) activated by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under sunlight. Analysis results confirmed the oxidation process was executed by Se-CN/ZnO synergistic MCO-activated PMS for the responsive degradation of LEV, achieving a removal efficiency greater than 98.6 % within 15 min (kinetic rate constant Kobs = 0.299 min(-1)), under optimal conditions ([Se-CN/ZnO (300 degrees C)]0 = 46 mg, [MCO](0) = 1.6 mg, [PMS](0) = 0.27 mM, [Aeration rate](0) = 146 mL/min, pH = 5.5). Effective interfacial transfer and spatial segregation of the photogenerated electron-hole were attributed to the stabilized Type-II energy band structure of Se-CN/ZnO, the rapid cyclic redox of metal ions Mnn+(n = 2,3,4) and Com+(m = 2,3) promoted the activation of PMS reduction of LEV through synergistic action of various endogenous substances. Analysis of the contribution of reactive oxygen species by electron paramagnetic resonance substantiated the dominant role of center dot OH and O-2 center dot-, and the superiority of the degradation process was further validated with the analysis of the non-toxic and ecological safety characteristics of intermediates. The recommended method of eco-friendly and stable catalytic performance of LEV has engineering application prospects that are incomparable to many publicly available treatment methods.

AB The trading of carbon emissions is a crucial regulatory method to address environmental pollution issues. This study takes China ' s carbon emission trading pilot policy established in 2013 as a quasi-natural experiment and uses the DID model to empirically test the urban panel data from 2006 to 2019. The results show that the carbon emission trading pilot policy can effectively reduce urban environmental pollution, and this effect is more noticeable in mid-western cities, northern cities, cities with fewer resources, and large-scale cities. In addition, to address the urban environmental pollution problem through this policy, the government is encouraged to raise its environmental protection awareness and put more effort into the innovation of technology. In general, this study uses carbon emission trading policies from China to confirm that market-based incentive environmental regulation tools can effectively reduce environmental pollution in urban areas. These findings can provide more theoretical support and empirical evidence for the government to use mechanisms of the market to effectively solve pollution problems, improve ecological environment quality, and accelerate the realization of green economy.

AB Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin disease associated with Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), with serious physical and psychological effects on patients. Conventional topical use of antibiotics is not effective due to the skin barrier and oral administration can adversely affect the intestinal flora. Microneedle is a novel type of localized drug delivery system that noninvasively breaks through the stratum corneum barrier and effectively enhances the transdermal absorption of drugs. Here, Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP)/Hyaluronic acid (HA) loaded Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as the microneedle body to easily penetrate the epidermis and enhance antibacterial ability. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Diatomaceous earth (DE) are used as the microneedle backing to absorb pus and bacterial debris, prevent re-infection of bacteria and promote skin healing. Compared to traditional antibiotics, the excellent skin permeability of EGCG@BSP/HA MNs studied here can improve the efficacy and solve side effects and drug resistance. In vivo studies in mice models induced by P. acnes showed that this microneedle could effectively reduce skin swelling, inhibit bacterial growth and reduce the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and MMP-2. In summary, this study provides an ideal antimicrobial drug delivery system for the treatment of acne vulgaris.

AB It is challenging to ensure car driving comfort and safety under denial-of-service (DoS) jamming attacks. For this reason, this article proposes a resilient-based and attack-intensity adaptive event-triggered control scheme to study the H-infinity controlled networked active quarter-vehicle suspension systems (QVSSs), which reduces the frequency of controller updates and provides robust resistance to DoS attacks. It is shown that if the tendency of DoS attack intensity increases, more communication signals can be transmitted to the controller. Conversely, if the tendency of DoS attack intensity decreases, fewer communication signals are being utilized. Using the novel two-side looped-functional method and some technical lemmas, sufficient conditions for the exponential stability and H-infinity control performance of QVSSs are obtained. Simulation results indicate that the suggested control approach enhances driving comfort and safety while reducing the data transmission burden.

AB This paper investigates the synchronization control of neural networks (NNs) considering parameter uncertainties by utilizing an improved asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (ALKF) method. Firstly, an uncertain NNs model with discrete and distributed delays is developed. To synchronize the master-slave system, a memory sampled-data controller is designed. Secondly, an improved ALKF is constructed, in which the positive-definite and symmetric restrictions of matrices are relaxed. Furthermore, improved synchronization criteria are established by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are based on the ALKF method and the integral inequality technique. Finally, two simulation examples are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the established stability conditions in reaching a maximum sampling period.

AB Background Nurses bear a lot of stressors at work. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is a widely used self-reported scale for measuring the global perception of stress. However, there is a lack of use of the PSS-10 in Chinese nurses. This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the PSS-10 among Chinese nurses.Methods A total of 708 Chinese nurses completed the PSS-10, the Big Five Inventory (BFI), and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested the factor structure of the PSS-10. Cronbach's alpha and test-retest correlation examined the scale reliability. Pearson correlation and hierarchical regression analyses tested the convergent, discriminant and criterion validity of the PSS-10.Results CFA revealed that a two-factor model fits the structure of the PSS-10 in Chinese nurses (chi 2/df = 6.25, p < 0.001; comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.94, non-normal fit index [NNFI] = 0.92, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = 0.91, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.08, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = 0.05). The scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alpha = 0.86) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity with relations to Big Five personalities, as well as good criterion validity such that the PSS-10 score could explain incremental variance in predicting anxiety, depression and stress.Conclusions Our findings suggest that PSS-10 is a reliable and valid measure of perceived stress among Chinese nurses and can be used in future research and practice on stress management and coping in Chinese nurses.

AB Background: Obesity is a globally increasing health problem that impacts multiple organ systems and a potentially modifiable risk factor for many diseases. Obesity has a significant impact on lung function and is strongly linked to the pathophysiology that contributes to lung diseases. On the other hand, reports have emerged that obesity is associated with a better prognosis than for normal weight individuals in some lung diseases, including pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The lesser mortality and better prognosis in patients with obesity is known as obesity paradox. Whilst obesity paradox is both recognized and disputed in epidemiological studies, recent research has suggested possible mechanisms.Summary: In this review, we attempts to explain and summarize these factors and mechanisms, including immune response, pulmonary fibrosis, lung function, microbiota, fat and muscle reserves, which are significantly altered by obesity and may contribute to the obesity paradox in lung diseases. We also discuss contrary literature that attributes the "obesity paradox" to confounding.Key Messages: The review will illustrate the possible role of obesity in the prognosis or course of lung diseases, leading to a better understand of the obesity paradox and provide hints for further basic and clinical research in lung diseases.

AB Chicken coccidiosis can cause severe enteritis with high mortality, which causes serious eco-nomic losses to the global breeding industry each year. The most virulent species is Eimeria tenella (E. ten-ella), but the infectivity of different E. tenella varies among geographic strains. At present, there are no reports related to the pathogenicity and drug resistance of E. tenella in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, China. A total of 600 fecal samples were collected from 10 farms in Zhe-jiang province, the overall oocyst prevalence was 54.2% (325/600). The prevalence was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in chickens under 40 d (97.5%) than that in chick-ens between 60 and 85-days-old (40.5%) and chickens over 90-days-old (24.5%). E. tenella stain was isolated from fecal samples of chickens in Yiwu and the pathoge-nicity of this isolate was determined, and then we recorded the survival rate, bloody stool score, lesion score, average weight gain. The results showed that all of the chickens infected with 5 x 105 sporulated oocysts of E. tenella died after the seventh day of infection, the bloody stool score and average lesion score of chickens from group 1 (5 x 105), group 2 (5 x 104), group 3 (5 x 103) and group 4 (5 x 102) decreased successively; the average weight gain (g) and relative weight gain (%) increased successively; the weight gain of the low-dose E. tenella infection groups (5 x 103 and 5 x 102) were higher than the other 2 groups (5 x 105 and 5 x 104) (P < 0.05). Finally, The E. tenella isolate was tested for sen-sitivity to 6 anticoccidial drugs (sulfachloropyrazine sodium, amproline, toltrazuril, clopidol, salinomycin, and nicarbazine) using 4 indexes including anticoccidial index(ACI), percent of optimum anticoccidial activity (POAA), reduction of lesion scores (RLS), and relative oocyst production (ROP). The results showed that this isolate has developed severe resistance to drugs of salino-mycin and nicarbazine, moderate resistance to ampro-line and clopidol, slight resistance to toltrazuril, while the E. tenella isolate performed more sensitive to sulfa-chloropyrazine sodium.

AB The semi-open system of lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) results in electrolyte depletion, lithium anode corrosion, and by-product deposition, and therefore represents a major challenge that hinders their application. Here, the aligned and open microchannel structures of wood are fabricated as separators to provide low-tortuosity pathways for rapid ionic transport and serve as reservoirs for retaining the electrolyte by capillary forces to improve the electrochemical kinetics. In an open environment, the wood separator can hold 39% of the initial adsorption electrolyte capacity after 40 days, much higher than that of glass fiber (GF, 15%). The cellulose in the wood can confine the crossover effect of water thereby inhibiting the corrosion of lithium anode and reducing the deposition of by-products. Density functional theory calculations certify that the abundant functional groups and uniform electron distribution in cellulose increase lithium-ion concentration on the wood surface and promote lithium-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. LOBs composed of the wood-derived separator displayed excellent anodic reversibility (over 1200 h) and effectively improved cathodic lifetime over 300 cycles (1.6 times longer than that of GF separator). These findings illustrate the significant potential of this candidate separator for high-performance LOBs and are expected to be extended to metal-air batteries.

AB Water pollution has become one of the most concerned environmental issues on the worldwide scale. Due to the harmfulness of the heavy metal ions and microorganisms in wastewater, novel filtration membranes for water treatment are expected to simultaneously clear these pollutants. Herein, the electro-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based magnetic ion-imprinted membrane (MIIM) were fabricated to achieve both selective removal of Pb(II) ions and excellent antibacterial efficiency. The competitive removal experiments showed that the MIIM displayed efficiently selective removal of Pb(II) (45.4 mg center dot g(-1)). Pseudo-second-order mode and Langmuir isotherm equation is well matched with the equilibrium adsorption. The MIIM showed sustained removal performance (similar to 79.0 %) against Pb(II) ions after 7 adsorption-desorption cycles with negligible Fe ions loss of 7.3 %. Moreover, the MIIM exhibited excellent antibacterial properties that >90 % of E. coli and S. aureus were killed by the MIIM. In conclusion, the MIIM provides a novel technological platform for integration of multi-function with selective metal ions removal, excellent cycling reusability, and enhanced antibacterial fouling property, which can be potentially utilized as a promising adsorbent in actual treatment of polluted water.

AB Conventional wound dressings fail to satisfy the requirements and needs of wounds in various stages. It is challenging to develop a multifunctional dressing that is hemostatic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and promotes wound healing. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a multifunctional sponge dressing for the full -stage wound healing based on copper and two natural products, Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) and peony leaf extract (PLE). The developed BSP-Cu-PLE sponges were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and oS to assess micromorphology and elemental composition. Their properties and bioactivities were also verified by the further experiments, whereby the findings revealed that the BSP-Cu-PLE sponges had improved water absorption and porosity while exhibiting excellent antioxidative, biocompatible, and biodegradable properties. Moreover, the antibacterial test revealed that BSP-Cu-PLE sponges had superior antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Furthermore, the hemostatic activity of BSP-Cu-PLE sponges was significantly enhanced in a rat liver trauma model. Most notably, further studies have demonstrated that the BSP-Cu-PLE sponges could significantly (p < 0.05) accelerate the healing process of skin wounds by stimulating collagen deposition, promoting angio-genesis, and decreasing inflammatory cells. In summary, the BSP-Cu-PLE sponges could provide a new strategy for application in clinical setting for full-stage wound healing.

AB In this work, we are concerned with the finite-time synchronization (FTS) control issue of the drive and response delayed memristor-based inertial neural networks (MINNs). Firstly, a novel finite-time stability lemma is developed, which is different from the existing finite-time stability criteria and extends the previous results. Secondly, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, designing effective delay-dependent feedback controllers and combining the finite-time control theory with a new non-reduced order method (NROD), several novel theoretical criteria to ensure the FTS for the studied MINNs are provided. In addition, the obtained theoretical results are established in a more general framework than the previous works and widen the application scope. Lastly, we illustrate the practicality and validity of the theoretical results via some numerical examples.

AB The impacts of added NaCl and subsequent fermentation with Lactobacillus sakei or Lactobacillus plantarum on proteolysis and protein oxidation in yak jerky were investigated. The proteolytic activity, peptide content and free amino acid concentration displayed decline patterns as NaCl content increased from 0 to 4% (P < 0.05), while the salted jerky fermented with lactobacillus demonstrated higher proteolysis profiles than the control without starter cultures (P < 0.05), and jerky fermented with Lactobacillus sakei showed the highest proteolysis. Adding NaCl promoted protein carbonylation, sulfhydryl loss and tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Fermentation with lactobacillus, especially with Lactobacillus sakei, effectively reduced the oxidation of sarco-plasmic and myofibrillar proteins in salted jerky (P < 0.05). Electrophoretogram showed that the changes in number and intensity of protein bands were from combined action of NaCl curing and microbial fermentation. The results suggest that both of NaCl addition and subsequent fermentation influence the protein chemical properties and hence modify the relevant quality traits of yak jerky.

AB The frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing and expected to increase more in the future, together with global change. However, how extreme events and global change factors interactively influence community structures and ecosystem processes is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the responses of the temporal stability and resilience of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of an alpine meadow to an extreme flooding event under different treatments of experimental drought and clipping. We found that ecosystems that were exposed to drought treatments for 3 years significantly decreased the temporal stability of community productivity but increased resilience to flooding, whereas their resistance to or recovery from flooding did not change. Neither clipping nor its interaction with drought altered the responses of these community stability metrics to flooding. Drought treatments significantly decreased plant species richness and asynchrony and dominant species stability, leading to a decrease in temporal stability and an increase in resilience in response to the extreme flooding event. The study also revealed that the change in species asynchrony was the dominant impact pathway determining the responses of resilience and temporal stability to flooding. Our results highlight that alpine grassland that experiences a multiyear drought may aggravate the instability of community productivity to extreme climatic events by reducing species asynchrony.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the denaturation manner of sarcoplasmic proteins (SP) under PSE condition to explain their positive impacts on water-holding compacity. We found that the SP precipitation under PSE-like condition (pH 5.5, 40 degrees C) and heating conditions (pH 5.5, 7.0, 8.0, 55 degrees C) were similar, but the myofibrillar water-holding capacity was improved only under PSE-like condition (pH 5.5, 40 degrees C). To understand the denaturation mechanism of SP, their physicochemical properties were examined. Results demonstrated that PSE-denaturation and heat-denaturation of SP were two different processes. At pH 7.0 and 8.0, the unfolding of SP due to temperature elevation did not alter the overall net surface negative charges but only increased hydrophobicity, whereas at pH 5.5, the net surface positive charges and hydrophobicity increased dramatically. We hypothesized that in PSE meat, denatured SP became highly positively charged and hydrophobic and easier to bind to the negatively charged MF, which is related to the improvement on water-holding capacity.

AB This study investigated and compared the reactivities of NH3-SCR and methane-to-methanol reactions over the monolithic Cu/SSZ-13 catalysts with different zeolite crystal sizes before and after hydrothermal aging. It was found that the methanol yield decreases with the increase in crystal size in methane-to-methanol, and a severe deactivation was detected after aging. However, the NH3-SCR performance presents a higher thermal stability and even an enhanced low-temperature reactivity after aging. The fresh and aged catalysts were comprehensively characterized by XRD, SEM, N-2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H-2-TPR, XPS, UV-vis-NIR and in-situ DRIFTS measurements. The results indicate that the isolated Cu2+ species, including those that interacted with two Al in 6MR and [Cu-II(OH)](+) motifs, and acid sites are main active centers for NH3-SCR. While CuxOy clusters, [Cu-II(OH)](+) motifs and Bronsted acid sites in the Cu-CHA frameworks could be important active sites for methane-to-methanol. Besides, the stable SCR performance is ascribed to the stable textural property, higher crystallinity of zeolite, increased NH3 storage capacity and isolated Cu2+ active sites. The loss of the catalytic activity in methane-to-methanol is mainly attributed to the decrease of Bronsted acid sites and CuxOy concentration and the break of zeolite crystal structure. This work concludes the differences in active sites and hydrothermal stability between NH3-SCR and methane-to-methanol reactions, it is very helpful to understand the two reactions.

ID BETA-LACTOGLOBULIN; BINDING; SIZE; HARD; SOFT; AU; ADSORPTION
AB Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) provide a novel approach for protein enrichment and analysis due to their protein adsorption properties, forming a so called protein corona. This corona can significantly influence the protein's structure and characteristics, hindering their identification in situ. Dissociation is an important solution to analyze and identify the composition of protein coronas. However, a comprehensive picture of adsorbed protein dissociation is lacking. In this study, the protein dissociation from the protein corona and influencing factors were investigated on the basis of the formation mechanism and time evolution. Temperature and cysteine are the key factors influencing protein dissociation by altering the protein's binding ability. The results showed that half Au-S formation time is an important time point for thio-protein dissociation by the method of high speed centrifugation. When incubated for longer than that time, the thio-protein located in the hard corona could only be separated by beta-mercaptoethanol replacement under analytical ultracentrifugation. However, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed significant changes that occurred in beta lg's secondary structure after ultracentrifugation. The Au-S bond formation time offers the potential to define the protein enrichment time of AuNPs.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Duoxuekang (DXK,) is a clinical experience prescription of CuoRu-Cailang, a famous Tibetan medicine master, which has effective advantages in the treatment of hypobaric hypoxia (HH)-induced brain injury. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
   Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of DXK on cerebrovascular function of HH-induced brain injury in mice.
   Materials and methods: DSC-MR imaging was used to evaluate the effect of DXK on the brain blood perfusion of patients with hypoxic brain injury. HPLC analysis was used to detect the content of salidmside, gallic acid, tyrosol, corilagin, ellagic acid, isorhamnetin, quercetin and gingerol in DXK. The model of HH-induced brain injury in mice was established by an animal hypobaric and hypoxic chamber. The BABL/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: control group, model group, Hongjingtian oral liquid group (HOL, 3.3 ml/kg) and DXK groups (0.9, 1.8 and 3.6 g/kg). All mice (except the control group) were intragastrically administrated for a continuous 7 days and put into the animal hypobaric and hypoxic chamber after the last intragastric administration. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was employed to evaluate the pathological changes of brain tissue. Masson and Weigert stainings were used to detect the content of collagen fibers and elastic fibers of brain, respectively. Routine blood test and biochemical kits were used to analyze hematological parameters and oxidative stress indices. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to detect the protein levels of VEGF, CD31/vWF and alpha-SMA.
   Results: The results of DSC-MR imaging confirmed that DXK can increased CBV in the left temporal lobe while decreased MTT in the right frontal lobe, right temporal lobe and right occipital lobe of the brain. DXK contains salidroside, gallic acid, tymsol, corilagin, ellagic acid, isorhamnetin, quercetin and gingerol. Compared with the model group, DXK can ameliorate the atrophy and deformation, and increase the number of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA3 area and cortical neurocytes. Masson and Weigert stainings results revealed that DXK can significantly increase the content of collagen fibers and elastic fibers in brain. Routine blood test results demonstrated that DXK can dramatically decrease the levels of WBC, MCH and MCHC, while increase RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV and PLT in the blood samples. Biochemical results revealed that DXK can markedly increase SOD, CAT and GSH activities, while decrease MDA activity. Immunofluorescence revealed that DXK can notably increase the protein levels of VEGF, CD31/vWF and alpha-SMA.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, this study proved that DXK can ameliorate HH-induced brain injury by improving brain blood perfusion, increasing the number of collagen and elastic fibers and inhibiting oxidative stress injury. The underlying mechanisms may be involved in maintaining the integrity of cerebrovascular endothelial cells and vascular function. However, further in vivo and in vitro investigations are still needed to elucidate the mechanisms of DXK on regulating cerebral blood vessels.

AB Chemical functionalization is widely adopted to increase the hydrophilicity of fullerene for various applications. Protein-nanomaterial (NM) interactions are one of the very first issues after NMs enter biological systems, which determines their bio-effects and toxicity. To better understand the biological and environmental effects of fullerene, we investigated the influence of surface modification on the fullerene-protein interaction by experimental and computational approaches. Pristine fullerene (C-60) was functionalized to obtain esterified fullerene (C-60-COOR), carboxylated fullerene (C-60-COOH) and fullerenol (C-60-OH), resulting in higher hydrophilicity and dispersibility following the sequence C-60-OH > C-60-COOH > C-60-COOR > C-60. The docking results suggested that good hydrophilic functionalization largely reduced the pi-pi interaction between aromatic residues and the fullerene cage, resulting in a weaker interaction between fullerene and lysozyme. Experimentally, the chemically functionalized fullerene showed more inhibition of enzyme activity. Correspondingly, the protein conformation changed more after incubation with functionalized fullerene with hydrophilic moieties (C-60-COOH and C-60-OH), indicated by the increased UV absorbance, the inhibition of intrinsic fluorescence and the loss of the alpha-helix structure. The contradictory results of computational and experimental approaches were attributed to the different dispersibilities, where functionalized fullerene with hydrophilic moieties dispersed well in aqueous systems to reach the lysozyme active pocket more easily. As a direct bio-effect, the dispersible fullerenes inhibited the antibacterial activity of lysozyme, which might affect the resistance to infection and the applications of lysozyme in biomedicine, food and bioengineering. Our findings suggested that surface modification should be carefully designed to obtain safer carbon NMs and enough consideration should be paid to the protein-nanomaterial interaction in environmental toxicity evaluations.

AB Background miRNAs play an important role in regulating normal animal development. Muscle tissue and fat metabolism are important for maintaining energy balance in animals. Yak has important agricultural and economic importance as it provides milk, meat, and hair. It is used for transportation as well. However, the miRNA expression profiles of their muscle and adipose tissue are currently unknown. Objective To explore the regulatory roles of miRNAs in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissues of yak. Methods A total of 12 small RNA libraries were constructed from the skeletal muscle and adipose samples from yak aged 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 7.5 years. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to determine the dynamic expression profile of miRNA, and a miRNA regulatory network related to muscle and adipose tissue development was established. Results miR-1-3p and miR-143-3p showed the highest expression during yak skeletal muscle and fat development, respectively. The MAPK and Ras signaling pathways were the pivotal pathways. miR-181-5p, miR-542-3p, and miR-424-5p may have key roles in skeletal muscle development, and CREBRF, GRB10, CDK1, RFX3, and EPC2 were the core target genes. While miR-127-5p, miR-379-3p, and miR-494-3p may play important regulatory roles in adipose deposition, and ETV1, XPO7, and C5AR2 were the core target genes. Conclusion This study provides valuable resources for further study of the molecular mechanisms underlying yak skeletal muscle and adipose tissue development, and also a basis for studying the interactions between genes and miRNAs.

AB Organic ferroelectrics with high dielectric constant have received substantial attention for sustainable and flexible energy storage. Here, we report a high-kappa dielectric, optically transparent, mechanically strong and flexible dielectric polymer produced by in situ formation of biaxial ferroelectric-molecule-modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The composite film was fabricated by solution casting of a PVA solution containing water-soluble dielectric crystals [Hdabco]ClO4. Atomic force microscopic and polarized optical microscopic studies showed a uniform dispersion of TEDA.C crystals with tunable rod-like or dendritic microstructures in the PVA matrix. Because of the good compatibility and hydrogen bonds between PVA and TDEA.C, the modified PVA films presented a significant enhancement of the dielectric constant and energy storage density by 10-100-fold over neat PVA. The polarization-electric loops indicated that the PVA composite films possessed increased saturation polarization in comparison to neat PVA film. The remnant polarization of PVA composite films was improved by around 3200 times with 9 wt % TEDA.C. Also, the TEDA.C@PVA films exhibited 85% transparency throughout the visible spectrum, 116% increase in storage modulus, and 274% elongation at fracture. These unprecedented high-kappa dielectric, optical, and mechanical properties may break the restrictions in the applications of traditional ferroelectric materials and greatly expand the usage of dielectric polymers in broad fields.

AB Alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau has undergone severe degradation, even desertification. However, several questions remain to be answered, especially the response mechanisms of vegetation biomass to soil properties. In this study, an experiment on degradation gradients was conducted in an alpine meadow at the Zoige Plateau in 2017. Both vegetation characteristics and soil properties were observed during the peak season of plant growth. The classification and regression tree model (CART) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were applied to screen the main factors that govern the vegetation dynamics and explore the interaction of these screened factors. Both aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) experienced a remarkable decrease along the degradation gradients. All soil properties experienced significant variations along the degradation gradients at the 0.05 significance level. Soil physical and chemical properties explained 54.78% of the variation in vegetation biomass along the degradation gradients. AGB was mainly influenced by soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), and pH. Soil available nitrogen (SAN), SOC and pH, had significant influence on BGB. Most soil properties had positive effects on AGB and BGB, while SBD and pH had a slightly negative effect on AGB and BGB. The correlations of SWC with AGB and BGB were relatively less significant than those of other soil properties. Our results highlighted that the soil properties played important roles in regulating vegetation dynamics along the degradation gradients and that SWC is not the main factor limiting plant growth in the humid Zoige region. Our results can provide guidance for the restoration and improvement of degraded alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Soft conductors with high conductivity are highly desirable and valuable for the development of various flexible and wearable electronics. However, their preparation requires expensive equipment and tedious multi-step processes, resulting in high costs and limited applications. In this work, super soft conductors based on liquid metal/cotton composites were fabricated with cotton thread as the soft substrate and liquid metals as the conductive filler. The three-dimensional (3D) continuous liquid metal/cotton composites were formed on the surface layer of conductors by rubbing treatment, which has the advantages of easy operation, low cost and large-area production. The conductivity of the as-obtained conductor with a 96.8 wt% liquid metal content can reach up to 2.46 x 10(6) S m(-1). Due to the super softness of cotton fibers and the fluid property of liquid metals, the conductor presented outstanding durability and stability against repeated external deformations (5000 folding tests) with the help of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which acted as the protective layer. Furthermore, the soft conductor coated by PDMS was fabricated as a capacitive type of pressure sensor, which was integrated into sensing gloves and arrays to collect the pressure signals steadily and continuously.

AB The polarization and decomposition of RDX crystal in external electric fields are simulated using molecular dynamics with ReaxFF force field. The results show that the molecular conformation of RDX is transformed from AAE to AAI in the electric field of 0.45 V/angstrom due to the polarization. In the process of the decomposition of RDX in the electric field, the energy of the system and the exothermic energy of the reaction increase with the increasing of the electric field intensity, and the overall characteristic time of the initial reaction is shorter than that without electric field, which indicates that the external electric field can greatly accelerate the decomposition reaction of RDX.

AB Background: Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), a diterpene acid isolated from the root bark of Pseudolarix kaempferi, exhibits a potent anti-cancer activity in a variety of tumor cells.
   Purpose: The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of PAB on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines in vitro, and to explore the underlying mechanism.
   Methods: The anti-proliferative activity of PAB on HCC cells were assessed via sulforhodamine B staining, colony formation, cell cycle analysis, respectively. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and diamidino-phenyl-indole staining, respectively. Protein expression regulated by PAB treatment was tested by western blotting.
   Results: The present results showed that PAB significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, SK-Hep-1, and Huh-7 HCC cell lines in vitro with IC50 values of 1.58, 1.90, and 2.06 mu M, respectively. Furthermore, PAB treatment repressed the colony formation in HepG2, SK-Hep-1, and Huh-7 HCC cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that PAB caused an obvious cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and induced apoptosis with the induction of p21, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP in human HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells. Mechanistically, PAB treatment down-regulated the phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and Akt. Moreover, abnormal GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin signaling in HepG2 cells was remarkably suppressed by PAB treatment. Finally, proliferation markers including cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin were also down-regulated by PAB treatment in HepG2 cells.
   Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that PAB exerts anti-cancer activity in HCC cells through inhibition of STAT3, ERK1/2, Akt, and GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin carcinogenic signaling pathways, and may be used as a phytomedicine in the treatment of HCC.

AB Background: Reducing dietary Crude Protein (CP) and supplementing with certain Amino Acids (AAs) has been known as a potential solution to improve Nitrogen (N) efficiency in dairy production. Thus understanding how AAs are utilized in various sites along the gut is critical.
   Objective: AA flow from the intestine to Portal-drained Viscera (PDV) and liver then to the mammary gland was elaborated in this article. Recoveries in individual AA in PDV and liver seem to share similar AA pattern with input: output ratio in mammary gland, which subdivides essential AA (EAA) into two groups, Lysine (Lys) and Branched-chain AA (BCAA) in group 1, input: output ratio >1; Methionine (Met), Histidine (His), Phenylalanine (Phe) etc. in group 2, input: output ratio close to 1. AAs in the mammary gland are either utilized for milk protein synthesis or retained as body tissue, or catabolized. The fractional removal of AAs and the number and activity of AA transporters together contribute to the ability of AAs going through mammary cells. Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is closely related to milk protein synthesis and provides alternatives for AA regulation of milk protein synthesis, which connects AA with lactose synthesis via alpha-lactalbumin (gene: LALBA) and links with milk fat synthesis via Sterol Regulatory Element-binding Transcription Protein 1 (SREBP1) and Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor (PPAR).
   Conclusion: Overall, AA flow across various tissues reveals AA metabolism and utilization in dairy cows on one hand. While the function of AA in the biosynthesis of milk protein, fat and lactose at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level from another angle provides the possibility for us to regulate them for higher efficiency.

AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata (RRP) is a popular medicinal herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat CVDs. However, the development of this novel therapeutic product has been stagnant, and its molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. This study aims to explore the effective ingredients of RRP against CVDs, especially atherosclerosis (AS). Using the AutoDock Vina software, the RRP's ingredients were docked with the targets which can be collected by RCSB and UniProt. Then the screened ingredients and targets could be used to dispose the pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We used GEO, GCBI and DAVID databases to analyze the microarray data of AS which could be used to verify the results of molecular docking, all of which could show the molecular mechanism of RRP on CVDs. We also constructed a compound-target interaction network of CVD with 85 nodes and 272 edges on the basis of molecular docking analysis through Cytoscape. The network showed that forsythiaside, acteoside and stigmasterol are the most important compounds and 2HRR (ACAT (Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl transferase) protein), 4ATB (MMP13) and 1JBQ (cystathionine beta-synthase) are the most valuable targets in the action of RRP against CVD. We also examined the biological functions involved in the biological process, molecular function and cellular components. In accordance with the analysis of GSE6054 microarray data of AS disease, the 20 most specifically expressed genes (differentially expressed genes [DEGsj) and the top 10 pathways of DEGs were discovered. Five key pathways, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were also explored. Amongst these pathways, the top three were the pathways in cancer, MAPK signalling pathway and human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection. The pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway were found simultaneously in the pathway analysis for CVD on RRP and for AS on microarray data. This study provided a new potential herbal medicine against CVD and has increased the understanding on the molecular mechanisms of RRP-mediated protection against CVD, especially AS.

AB Myoblast differentiation is a highly complex process that is regulated by proteins as well as by non-coding RNAs. Circular RNAs have been identified as an emerging new class of non-coding RNA in the modulation of skeletal muscle development, whereas their expression profiles and functional regulation in myoblast differentiation remain unknown. In the present study, we performed deep RNA-sequencing of C2C12 myoblasts during cell differentiation and uncovered 37,751 unique circular RNAs derived from 6943 hosting genes. The ensuing qRT-PCR and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization verification were carried out to confirm the RNA-sequencing results. An unbiased analysis demonstrated dynamic circular RNA expression changes in the process of myoblast differentiation, and the circular RNA abundances were independent from their cognate linear RNAs. Gene ontology analysis showed that many down-regulated circular RNAs were exclusive to cell division and the cell cycle, whereas up-regulated circular RNAs were related to the cell development process. Furthermore, interaction networks of circular RNA-microRNA were constructed. Several microRNAs well-known for myoblast regulation, such as miR-133, miR-24 and miR-23a, were in this network. In summary, this study showed that circular RNA expression dynamics changed during myoblast differentiation. Circular RNAs play a role in regulating the myoblast cell cycle and development by acting as microRNA binding sites to facilitate their regulation of gene expression during myoblast differentiation. These findings open a new avenue for future investigation of this emerging RNA class in skeletal muscle growth and development.

AB Carbon black (CB) is a preferred nano-reinforcer for conventional polymers, but it exhibit poor dispersibility, which makes it difficult for further application in the coating industry. Here we prepared hydroxylated carbon black (OCB) by a mild oxidation process and then covalently encapsulated with a urethane chains shell via in situ polymerization, and thus encapsulated carbon black (EOCB) particles were achieved. Surface chemical composition of the EOCB particles was thoroughly characterized by FT-IR, TGA, XPS, and EA techniques, and its dispersion properties in aqueous medium were studied by DLS, natural sedimentation, and TEM analyses. It was found that EOCB possessed a high encapsulation percentage, and showed excellent self-dispersibility and prominent stability in aqueous medium. Furthermore, intensive investigation demonstrated that PUB/EOCB composite, that prepared by blending EOCB particles with a polyurethane binder (PUB), exhibited improved mechanical property, water resistance and matting appearance, which probably due to the strong hydrogen bonds between the EOCB particles and the PUB matrix. This work provides a potential avenue for designing CB-based microcapsules and makes it promising application in waterborne coatings.

AB This paper addresses the stability problems of perturbed switched nonlinear systems with time-varying delays. It is assumed that the nominal switched nonlinear system (perturbation-free system) is uniformly exponentially stable and that the perturbations satisfy a linear growth bound condition. It is revealed that there exists an upper bound of perturbation guaranteeing that the perturbed system preserves the stability property of the nominal system, locally or globally, depending on both perturbations and the nominal system itself. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed theoretical results. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To analyse the stable operation range with varied input and output voltages, bifurcation behaviours and operation region of current-mode-controlled single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) boost converter are investigated. The inductor current borders and one-dimensional discrete-mapping model are deduced firstly. On the basis of the model, the bifurcation diagram and corresponding Lyapunov exponent spectrum are analysed. Two transition conditions and boundary equations of the converter are derived, where its working state transits from stability to instability, and its operation mode shifts from continuous conduction mode (CCM) to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The operation region with different circuit parameters can be estimated and divided through the parameter space maps, which is significant for the design of circuit parameters and stability control. Time-domain simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis results. The research results show that the three kinds of bifurcation behaviours including period-doubling bifurcation, border collision bifurcation, and tangential bifurcation exist in the current-mode-controlled SIDO boost converters. Different from the previous works, the SIDO boost converter has a particular bifurcation trend when border collisions occur. The trend includes that operation mode shifts from CCM to DCM and then backs to CCM, and system period increases or decreases doubly.

AB Objective: Aim was to assess the effect of aerobic exercise (AE) on blood lipid and glucose in obese or overweight adults.
   Methods: Literature search was performed on PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library, up to June 2015. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to assess the effect of AE on blood glucose and lipid indexes (triglyceride [TG], total cholesterol [TC], high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], TC/HDL-C, fasting blood-glucose [FBG]). Subgroup analyses were performed by duration of intervention (<= 2 months, 3 months and 6 months), gender (female and mixed population) and intervention protocols (AE vs. no intervention and AE + diet vs. diet only).
   Results: A total of 9 randomised controlled trials with 619 obese or overweight adults were included. Overall analysis showed AE could significantly enhance the decrease of TG level in obese or overweight adults, but not affect the other lipid and glucose indexes. Subgroup analyses showed that AE significantly changed the HDL-C level in female population and when intervention protocol of AE + diet vs. diet only was used. Meanwhile, the FBG level was also significantly changed by AE in mixed population.
   Conclusions: These findings indicated that AE could significantly improve TG, but not TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and FBG in obese or overweight adults. Meanwhile, gender and intervention protocols may be factors affecting the effect of AE on blood lipid and glucose in obese or overweight adults.

AB We report the use of an efficient hydrothermal method to synthesize superparamagnetic and red luminescent bifunctional Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles (NPs) with core@shell structures via a seed-growth procedure. Oleic acid coated Fe3O4 (OA-Fe3O4) NPs were initially synthesized using a coprecipitation method. The as-synthesized OA-Fe3O4 NPs were then used as seeds, on which the red upconversion luminescent shell (Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er) was formed. Furthermore, hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface modification of the Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er NPs was achieved via a ligand exchange method where oleic acid was displaced by a PEG phosphate ligand [PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)]. These materials were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The Fe3O4 cores were uniformly coated with a Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er shell, and the bifunctional Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er NPs were monodispersed. Furthermore, the Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er NPs exhibited a saturated magnetization value of 6.2 emu/g and emitted red luminescence under a 980 nm laser. The obtained bifunctional Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb/Er NPs may find potential applications in drug targeting, bioseparation, and diagnostic analysis. The synthetic method may be employed for the preparation of other bifunctional nanomaterials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary chromium (Cr) source and concentration on growth performance, carcass traits, and some serum lipid parameters of broilers under normal rearing conditions for 42 days. A total of 252 1-day-old Cobb 500 commercial female broilers were randomly allotted by body weight (BW) to one of six replicate cages (six broilers per cage) for each of seven treatments in a completely randomized design involved in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with three Cr sources (Cr propionate (CrPro), Cr picolinate (CrPic), Cr chloride (CrCl3)) and two concentrations of added Cr (0.4 and 2.0 mg of Cr/kg) plus a Cr-unsupplemented control diet. The results showed that dietary Cr supplementation tended to increase the breast muscle percentage compared with the Cr-unsupplemented control group (P = 0.0784), while Cr from CrPic tended to have higher breast muscle percentage compared with Cr from CrCl3 (P = 0.0881). Chromium from CrPic also tended to increase the breast intramuscular fat (IMF) compared with Cr from CrCl3 (P = 0.0648). In addition, supplementation of 0.4 mg/kg Cr tended to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P = 0.0614). Compared with the control group, broilers fed Cr-supplemented diets had higher triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.0129) regardless of Cr source and Cr concentration. Chromium from CrPro and CrPic had lower total cholesterol (TC) compared with Cr from CrCl3 (P = 0.0220). These results indicate that dietary supplementation of Cr has effects on carcass characteristics and serum lipid parameters of broilers under normal rearing conditions, while supplementation of organic Cr can improve carcass characteristics and reduce the cholesterol content in serum.

AB A new method was developed to synthesize polyfunctionalized dihydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran derivatives from the three-component [2 + 2 + 1] cydoaddition of the diazoesters with aryl/alkenyl aldehydes and alkyne/olefin dipolarophiles by using a Ag(I) N-heterocyclic carbene complex as the catalyst. A carbonyl ylide intermediate was generated, which undertook an endo-type 1,3-dipolar cydoaddition to provide the desired dihydro-/tetrahydrofurans in high regio- and diastereoselectivities by using alpha-aryl or alpha-alkenyl diazoesters.

AB MicroRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that participate in the regulation of diverse biological processes including skeletal muscle development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood, particularly in goat. Here, we identified goat miR-101a as a novel myogenic microRNA mediating myogenic differentiation. The expression of miR-101a was enriched in goat skeletal muscles and up-regulated during satellite cell differentiation. After transfection with a miR-101a mimic and culturing in differentiation medium, satellite cell differentiation was promoted, accompanied by a significant increase in mRNA expression of the myogenic marker, MyoG, and decreased expression of MyoD. In contrast, blocking the function of miR-101a with a 2'-O-methylated antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor repressed satellite cell differentiation. However, both gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR-101a had no significant influence on satellite cell proliferation. Therefore, our results provide a new insight on miR-101a in the regulation of goat skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Calcium nitrate and a lanthanum-modified bentonite (Phoslock(R)) were investigated for their ability to control the release of phosphorus from contaminated sediment. Their effectiveness and mode of action were assessed using microcosm experiments by monitoring the variation of physiochemical parameters and phosphorus and nitrogen species over time following the treatment for 66 days. Phoslock(R) was more effective reducing phosphorus in overlaying water and controlling its release from sediment. Calcium nitrate improved redox condition at the sediment-water interface and temporally reduce phosphorus in overlaying water but phosphorus level returned back in a long run. Phosphorus fractionation suggested that Phoslock(R) converted mobile phosphorus to more stable species while calcium nitrate increased the fractions of mobile phosphorus species. Phoslock(R) generally showed no effect on nitrogen species. Whereas calcium nitrate temporally increased nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium concentrations but their concentrations quickly reduced likely due to the denitrification process. Results suggested that Phoslock(R) can be more effective in controlling the release of phosphorus from sediment than calcium nitrate. However, calcium nitrate can improve the redox condition at the sediment-water interface, which may provide other benefits such as stimulating biodegradation.

AB The storage of molecular hydrogen in a novel 3D carbon structure - pillared graphene bubble system under various environments is calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) method. The graphene-based structures are designed with different sizes of semi-ellipsoidal graphene bubbles. The effects of pressure, temperature, and graphene interlayer spacing are systematically investigated in the isothermal isobaric (NPT) ensemble. Meanwhile, the internal pressures of molecular hydrogen in bubbles under various environments are also estimated. Results show that the hydrogen storage capacity of the pillared graphene bubble structures can be maximized by decreasing the temperature and increasing the pressure and the graphene interlayer spacing. The MD simulations demonstrate that the maximum gravimetric and volumetric H-2 densities inside the developed system are 13.7 wt% and 121.6kg/m(3), respectively. Impressively, the maximum gravimetric and volumetric H2 densities of the developed system are also calculated - 21.3 wt% and 210.3 kg/m(3), respectively, when the outer surface adsorption are taken into consideration. These values satisfy the requirements for mobile applications set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report a computational study of the aluminum doped germanium clusters GenAl (n = 1-9). The molecular geometries and electronic structures of the GenAl clusters are investigated systematically using quantum calculations at the B3LYP level with the 6-311G(d) basis sets. The growth pattern behaviors, stabilities, electronic properties, and magnetic moments of these clusters are discussed in detail. Obviously different growth patterns appear between small and larger Al-doped germanium clusters, the optimized equilibrium geometries trend to prefer the close-packed configurations for Al-doped germanium clusters up to n = 9. The size dependence of cluster average binding energies per atom (E-b/atom), second-order differences of total energies (Delta E-2), fragmentation energies (E-f) and HOMO-LUMO gaps of Gen+1 and GenAl (n = 1-9) clusters are studied. The stability results show that Gen+1 cluster possess relatively higher stability than GenAl cluster. Furthermore, the investigated highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps indicate that the Gen+1 and GenAl clusters have different HOMO-LUMO gap. In addition, the calculated vertical ionization potentials and vertical electron affinities confirm the electric properties of Gen+1 and GenAl clusters. Besides, the doping of Al atom also brings the decrease as the cluster sizes increase for atomic magnetic moments (mu(b)). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental stimuli-responsive nanosystems that can release their encapsulated or loaded substances in spatial-, temporal- and dosage-controlled fashions have attracted tremendous attention, especially from the field of nanomedicine. In this work, a novel temperature-switched controlled release nanosystem based on the molecular recognition of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and thermosensitivity based on the phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is developed. This smart nanosystem consists of magnetic Fe3O4 colloidal nanocrystal clusters (MCNCs) core grafted with linear PNIPAM chains attached to numerous beta-CD units, (denoted as Fe3O4@ PNG-CD). beta-CD units act as containers for the loading of hydrophobic model drugs, PNIPAM chains serve as intelligent "microvalves" for controlling the release of loaded model drugs, and MCNCs core can achieve a "site-specific targeting" function. The gating mechanism involves that temperature can significantly affect the association constants of beta-CD toward model drug molecules in beta-CD modified PNIPAM chains. The resultant Fe3O4@ PNG-CD nanoparticles have excellent thermo-reversible adsorption/desorption properties for the loaded model drug 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt (ANS), and demonstrate a positive temperature "on-off" release fashion. By simply changing the temperature, the delivery rate can be effectively controlled. At temperature above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the grafted PNG-CD chains (open gate), the delivery rate of ANS is fast, but very slow at temperature below the LCST (closed gate). These multifunctional nanoparticles provide a new mode for designing and engineering intelligent controlled release nanosystems.

AB To swiftly accomplish online fault diagnosis of water management for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), an online diagnosis method of water management faults based on hybrid-frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is proposed. First, guided by the principle of time-frequency signal processing, the online diagnosis of water management faults is conducted via the full-frequency band electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the characteristic information of the abscissa coordinates at the intersection of high and low frequencies in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Subsequently, an online diagnosis method of water management faults based on hybrid-frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is proposed to enhance the diagnostic speed. To validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, a test platform is established, and numerous tests and analyses are conducted on PEMFC under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately and swiftly identify various faults of water management in PEMFC, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 95.56%, with a diagnostic duration of approximately 4 s.

AB Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is a promising technology for practical wastewater treatment. In this study, we successfully synthesized Mn-Fe3O4@FeOOH catalysts characterized by abundant oxygen vacancies, and favorable magnetic properties for ozonation catalysis. The degradation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) through catalytic ozonation resulted in an approximate 40% mineralization, a substantial improvement compared to the 10% mineralization achieved through ozone treatment alone. The degradation of DMP in the catalytic ozonation system was primarily governed by both radical (hydroxyl radical, center dot OH) and non-radical pathways (surface atomic oxygen, *O). Combined phosphate quenching experiment results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that oxygen vacancies facilitate the formation of hydrated hydroxyl groups and can also serve as active sites for catalytic ozonation, facilitating the cleavage of the O-O bond in ozone to generate *O. Moreover, the Mn-Fe3O4@FeOOH catalyzed ozonation system exhibited excellent interference resistance and degradation performance in real wastewater and complex water matrices. This study clarifies the specific role of oxygen vacancies in FeOOH-catalyzed ozone systems, providing a new approach for enhancing ozone catalysts designed for effective wastewater treatment applications.

AB Two-Dimensional carbon-based materials as a potential hydrogen storage medium have attracted great attention. In this study, various key aspects such as structure, electronic properties, stability, and hydrogen storage performance of Na-modified Irida-Graphene (IG) were thoroughly investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation methods. The calculation results show that the binding energy of Na atoms with the substrate is 1.51 eV, far exceeding the cohesive energy. The AIMD results reflect the good thermal stability of the model. One Na atom can adsorb up to 5H2 molecules. The IG loaded with eight Na atoms on both sides can adsorb 32H2 molecules, achieving a hydrogen storage capacity of 7.82 wt%, far exceeding the US DOE target of 5.5 wt%. The calculated Van 't Hoff equation indicates a desorption temperature of 248 K for the model. Moreover, reversible hydrogen storage can be achieved at medium to low pressures, with desorption temperatures ranging from 285 K to 417 K. These results suggest that Na-Modified IG models are candidate materials for reversible hydrogen storage under near-ambient conditions.

DE Acute lung injury; Polygala tenuifolia extract; Inflammation;

AB Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) has received considerable attention in the field of critical care as it can lead to high mortality rates. Polygala tenuifolia, a traditional Chinese medicine with strong expectorant properties, can be used to treat pneumonia. Owing to the complexity of its composition, the main active ingredient is not yet known. Thus, there is a need to identify its constituent compounds and mechanism of action in the treatment of ALI using advanced technological means. Purpose: We investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism and constituent compounds with regard to the effect of P. tenuifolia Willd. extract (EPT) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in vivo and in vitro. Methods: The UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS technology was used to investigate the chemical profile of EPT. Network pharmacology was used to predict the targets and pathways of action of EPT in ALI, and molecular docking was used to validate the binding of polygalacic acid to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. The main compounds were determined using LC-MS. A rat model of LPS-induced ALI was established, and THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to construct an in vitro model. Pathological changes were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Wright-Giemsa staining, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of inflammatory factors (NE, MPO, Ly-6 G, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and iNOS) was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. The LPS + ATP-induced inflammation model in THP-1 cells was used to verify the in vivo experimental results. Results: Ninety-nine compounds were identified or tentatively deduced from EPT. Using network pharmacology, we found that TLR4/NF-kappa B may be a relevant pathway for the prevention and treatment of ALI by EPT. Polygalacic acid in EPT may be a potential active ingredient. EPT could alleviate LPS-induced histopathological lung damage and reduce the wet/dry lung weight ratio in the rat model of ALI. Moreover, EPT decreased the white blood cell and neutrophil counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreased the expression of genes and proteins of relevant inflammatory factors (NE, MPO, Ly-6 G, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and iNOS) in lung tissues. It also increased the expression of endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase expression. Western blotting confirmed that EPT may affect TLR4/NF-kappa B and NLRP3 signaling pathways in vivo. Similar results were obtained in THP-1 cells. Conclusion: EPT reduced the release of inflammatory factors by affecting TLR4/NF- kappa B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response of ALI. Polygalacic acid is the likely compounds responsible for these effects.

AB The advancement of flexible electronics relies heavily on the progress in flexible energy storage device technology, necessitating innovative design in flexible electrode materials. Among numerous potential materials, graphene-based composite films emerge as promising candidates due to their capacity to leverage the superior electrochemical and mechanical properties of graphene flakes. However, the influence of strong van der Waals forces often leads to inevitable agglomeration and self-stacking of adjacent graphene flakes. Consequently, achieving an elaborate control over the interlayer structure of graphene-based composite films becomes imperative to improve their structural stability in electrolytes and enhance charge/electron transfer efficiency. Herein, this review provides a comprehensive overview of diverse interfacial functional modification strategies for graphene and graphene oxide nanoflakes, thereby facilitating the assembly of graphene-based composite films. Additionally, it encompasses a discussion on the universal designs of micro-nanostructures within interlayers. Particularly, the technologies to manipulate, stabilize and orientate the interlayer channels and interlayer spacing are highlighted. These insights serve as an informative reference for the engineering of interlayer structures in graphene-based composite films. Furthermore, the review addresses the potential applications of flexible graphene-based composite films in wearable applications, current challenges, and future directions.

AB Growing evidence demonstrates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) is closely related to many chronic disease progressions, such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, because the over-expressed ROS that causes longterm oxidative stress in the body easily evolves into the chronic injury of tissue. Therefore, the development of ROS scavengers to prevent and treat ROS-related chronic diseases is significant. Among the numerous developed or discovered ROS scavengers, natural dietary ROS scavengers that existed in food such as curcumin and vitamin C, received great attention because they are naturally occurring and many of them have been used in medicine and health care products. However, some of them suffer from inherent defects like instability or too fast metabolism in vivo. These defects greatly limit their bioavailability and practical applications. Recently, it is found that the nanolization of dietary ROS scavengers can effectively improve their bioavailability and thus ameliorate therapeutic effects of ROS-related chronic diseases. Nevertheless, the systematic summarization of dietary ROS scavenger-based nanomaterials against ROS-related chronic disease is still rare. Herein, we attempt to give a review to inspire the research enthusiasm. In this review, firstly, the common types of dietary ROS scavengers in daily life, their main dietary sources, bioactivities as well as chronic disease applications and representative ROS-scavenging mechanisms are covered. Secondly, the general strategies to improve bioavailability of dietary ROS scavengers based on the nanolization are discussed. Thirdly, the applications and optimized design of dietary ROS scavenger-based nanomaterials against ROS-related various chronic diseases are systematically summarized. Finally, the challenges and future outlooks of this field are pointed out.

AB Solution pH is one of the primary factors affecting the efficiency of water decontamination. Although the influence of pH on oxidants activation, catalyst activity, and reactive oxygen species have been widely explored, there is still a scarcity of systemic studies on the changes in the oxidation behavior of organic pollutants at different pH levels. Herein, we report the influence laws of pH on the forms, reactivities, active sites, degradation pathways, and products toxicities of organic pollutants. Changes in pH cause the protonation or deprotonation of organic pollutants and further affect their forms and chemistry (e.g., electrostatic force, hydrophobicity, and oxidation potential). The oxidation potential of organic pollutants follows the order: protonated form > pristine form > deprotonated form. Moreover, protonation or deprotonation can modify the active sites and degradation pathways of organic pollutants, wherein deprotonation renders them more susceptible to electrophilic attack, while protonation reduces their activity against electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. Additionally, pH adjustments can modify the degradation pathway and the toxicity of transformation products. Overall, pH changes can affect the oxidation fate of organic pollutants by altering their structure, which distinguishes it from the effect of pH on oxidants or oxidant activation processes.

AB The practical application of luteolin in food systems faces challenges due to its inherent instability. This study aimed to develop luteolin-loaded liposomes coated with whey protein isolate (WPI) to enhance the thermal stability and antioxidant activity of luteolin. The physical characteristics of both luteolin-loaded liposomes (LUT-Lips) and WPI-coated luteolin-loaded liposomes (WPI-LUT-Lips) were assessed. At a 5% WPI concentration, WPI-LUT-Lips demonstrated excellent dispersibility and improved encapsulation efficiency. WPI interacted with the liposome membrane via hydrophobic forces, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic contact force, resulting in an efficient coating. Differential scanning calorimetry confirmed that WPI-LUT-Lips exhibited greater thermal sta-bility compared to LUT-Lips, attributed to the protective effect of the WPI. Furthermore, WPI-LUT-Lips displayed superior antioxidant activity, as evidenced by their DPPH scavenging activity (86.36 +/- 1.95%), TBARS reduction (25.33 +/- 1.90%), and reducing power (82.86 +/- 1.42%). Therefore, WPI-coated luteolin-loaded liposomes offer a promising way to enhance luteolin's integration into food systems.

AB This study examined the flavor profiles of fermented Ciba chili, comparing samples with Sichuan pepper (HJ) to those without Sichuan pepper (CK), using three analytical techniques: E-tongue, E-nose, and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). The results obtained from the E-tongue and E-nose exhibited a clear difference in taste and flavor between CK and HJ. In detail, CK mainly exhibited a sour flavor profile, whereas HJ displayed an intricate and rich flavor. The HS-GC-IMS results identified a total of 60 compounds in the samples, with terpenes, alcohols, and esters being the primary volatile flavor compounds. Additionally, Zanthoxylum was found to significantly enhance the concentration of these compounds in fermented Ciba chili. Through robust principal component analysis (rPCA), 17 distinct flavor compounds were selected. Correlation analysis revealed that most terpenes exhibited positive correlations with LY2/LG, LY2/gCT1, LY2/Gct, LY2/G, LY2/Gh, and terpenes were found in higher concentrations in HJ. This study contributes a theoretical basis and provides data support for optimizing the fermentation process and elucidating the underlying mechanism of characteristic aroma formation in Ciba chili after fermentation.

AB Microscale zero valent iron (mFe 0) is one of the most potential water pollution remediation materials, but the effective utilization ability of electrons released by mFe0 in the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is not satisfactory. Here, we find the microscale iron-copper (mFe/Cu) bimetals coated with cop-per on the surface of mFe0 can significantly improve the effective utilization of electrons released by mFe 0. Electrochemical analysis displays that copper plating on the surface of mFe/Cu can promote the release the electrons from mFe0 and reduce the impedance of mFe 0. Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Cu on the surface of mFe/Cu bimetals promotes the release of elec-trons from mFe0 and reduces the adsorption energy of Fe to Cr. As the electron transporter, moreover, Cu can always attract Cr to the hollow position near itself of the Fe surface, which could promote the effective utilization of electrons released by Fe. Effective utilization ability of electrons in mFe/Cu system is 12.5 times higher than that in mFe0 system. Our findings provide another basis for the efficient reduc-tion of Cr(VI) by mFe/Cu bimetals, which could promote the application and popularization of mFe/Cu bimetals.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB Desertification in alpine grasslands is exacerbated by rapid climate change and intensive anthropogenic activity, which will substantially threaten the structure and function of alpine grassland ecosystems. Artificial reseeding was a widely used strategy for the restoration of alpine sandy grasslands. However, it is still unclear whether reseeding restoration can improve multiple ecosystem functions of sandy meadows. To narrow these knowledge gaps, we evaluated the changes in plant communities, soil conditions, and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across native meadow, sandy meadow, and restored meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and further identified the links between individual and multiple ecosystem functions. Artificial reseeding had contributed to the promotion of plant diversity, productivity, soil fertility, and soil carbon and nitrogen sequestrations. However, the recovery levels of plant diversity, productivity, and soil fertility in the restored meadow were still far lower than that in the native meadow. The results revealed that the EMF index of the restored meadow increased greatly compared with the sandy meadow, but it did not recover to that of the native meadow level. In addition, short-term reseeding improved the aboveground EMF index more than the belowground EMF index. The EMF indexes and most individual ecosystem functions showed positive correlations with plant diversity and productivity. These findings indicated an important role of artificial reseeding in the restoration of ecosystem functions in the alpine sandy meadow, and it had critical implications for the regional ecological security and sustainable development of alpine grasslands.

AB Background: Cichorium intybus L. formula (CILF) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) widely used in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN). The aim of this research was to investigate the potential protective effect of CILF against HN and elucidated the underlying mechanism.Methods: CILF water extract was administered to an HN rat model established by adenine combined with ethambutol. The levels of uric acid (UA), serum urea nitrogen (UREA), and creatinine (CREA) were detected. Changes in the pathology and histology of the kidney were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The 16S rRNA of the gut microbiota was sequenced. The binding ability of the main ingredients of CILF to key targets was analyzed by network pharmacology and molecular docking. The expression levels of the related mRNAs and proteins in the kidney were evaluated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis.Results: CILF administration significantly alleviated increases in UA, UREA, and CREA, structural damage, and kidney dysfunction. Gut microbiota analysis was applied to explore the pharmacological mechanism of the effects of CILF on bacterial diversity and microbiota structure in HN. CILF decreased the abundance ofBacteroides. In addition, it increased the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae , and Bifidobacterium. Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis, CILF profoundly influenced the IL17, TNF and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway. Additionally, CILF inhibited the expression of STAT3, VEGFA and SIRT1 to improve the symptoms of nephropathy. Our research suggested that CILF protects against kidney dysfunction in rats with HN induced by adenine combined with ethambutol.Conclusion: Our findings on the anti-HN effects of CILF and its mechanism of action, from the viewpoint of systems biology, and elaborated that CILF can alter the diversity and community structure of the gut microbiota in HN, providing new approaches for the prevention and treatment of HN.

AB In this study, a natural antioxidant emulsifier, Millettia speciosa Champ polysaccharide conjugates (MSC-PC), was used for fabricating oil-in-water emulsion, and the influences of MSC-PC on ll-carotene stability and bioaccessibility were studied. Results suggested that MSC-PC stabilized emulsion exhibited excellent resistance to a wide range of salt levels (0-500 mM of Na+), thermal treatments (50-90 degrees C) and pH values (3.0-11.0). MSC-PC also exhibited an outstanding inhibition capacity on lipid oxidation. Besides, MSC-PC stabilized emulsion had a better protective effect on ll-carotene than other systems. Interestingly, in spite of similar lipolysis extent, ll-carotene bioaccessibility in MSC-PC fabricated emulsion (14.75 %) was markedly higher than that in commercial Tween 80 fabricated emulsion (10.08 %), likely due to the steric-hindrance effect and antioxidant ability of MSC-PC, building interfacial layers that prevented ll-carotene from degradation. This work supplied a deep insight into elucidating the mechanisms of emulsifying performance and ll-carotene protection effect of MSC-PC fabricated emulsion.

TI ROS-triggered nanoinducer based on dermatan sulfate enhances immunogenic
   cell death in melanoma
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE

AB Due to its complexity, diversity and heterogeneity, melanoma is a kind of malignant tumor. It has been proved that the enhancement of anti-tumor immune response such as immunogenic cell death (ICD) is an important therapeutic strategy. In previous studies, we confirmed that dermatan sulfate (DS) from skin tissue could specifically homing to melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study, we propose a nanoinducer (DOX/ADS NP) based on a functional DS for melanoma. This nanosystem is composed of DS as framework, aromatic thioketal derivative (ATK) as functional grafting unit and doxorubicin (DOX) designed as an ICD inducer. Through the intermolecular interaction between DOX and ATK, DOX/ADS NP with specific-homing, high-loading and ROS-triggering release was obtained via self-assemble. Compared with free DOX and non-functionalized nanomedicine, DOX/ADS NP could release DOX into B16F10 cells better, and strongly induce the translocation of calreticulin (CRT) to the cell membrane. CRT is a marker of ICD, also as a "eat me" signal to stimulate the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells. Therefore, a series of subsequent immune responses were activated: maturation of dendritic cells, T cells proliferation, increased tumor-infiltrating CTLs and the ratio of CTLs to Tregs, and up-regulated cytotoxic cytokine expression. In conclusion, DOX/ADS NP promoted ICD-associated immune response through more specific targeting effect and sensitive responsive DOX release, achieving better inhibitory effect on melanoma than free DOX and other nanoformulation. This biomimetic ICD nanoinducer based on DS is expected to provide new strategies and references for the treatment of melanoma.

AB Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by a complex and dysfunctional immune response. Currently, IBD is incurable, and patients with IBD often need to take drugs for life. However, as the traditional systemic treatment strategies for IBD do not target the site of inflammation, only limited efficacy can be obtained from them. Moreover, the possibility of serious side effects stemming from the systemic administration or redistribution of drugs in the body is high when conventional drug formulations are used. Therefore, a targeted drug-delivery system for IBD should be considered. Based on the pathological features related to IBD, the new targeted drug-delivery strategy can directly transfer the drug to the inflammatory site, thus enhancing the accumulation of the drugs and reducing side effects. This article reviews the pathological features of IBD and the application of the IBD-targeted delivery system based on different pathological features, and discusses the challenges and new prospects in this field.

AB Background: Pospartum Depression (PPD) causes significant adverse effects on mothers and their offspring. The condition is considered to have multiple pathogenic factors. However, the underlying neural basis of these factors keeps unclear. Methods: A group of 86 patients with PPD and 74 Healthy Postnatal Women (HPW) were enrolled in this structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study. Between-groups differences in regional gray matter volume (rGMV) were measured and association and mediation analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between rGMV, PPD severity and a range of demographic/clinical factors which could contribute to PPD. Results: Relative to HPW, PPD patients had higher scores indicating adverse effects on most questionnaires and higher prolactin levels, as well as increased rGMV in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right anterior insular (anI). In PPD patients, rGMV in right anI was positively correlated with prolactin level, PPD severity, and the number of children raised, whereas rGMV in left DLPFC was negatively correlated with education and age. Besides, prolactin level was found to mediate the association between rGMV in anI and PPD symptoms. Limitations: Potentially factors such as fertility or delivery pattern were not studied. Conclusion: Our results provide information on the risk and protective factors, and rGMV abnormalities, associated with PPD. The finding that prolactin level mediated the impact of rGMV in right anI on PPD symptoms is a potential mechanism for explaining the association between brain structure and PPD symptoms. Increased understanding of the neuro-pathophysiology of PPD is important for early diagnosis and treatment.

TI The mediation of perceived risk's impact on destination image and travel
   intention: An empirical study of Chengdu, China during COVID-19
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIORAL INTENTION; TOURISM; PERCEPTIONS; RESIDENTS
AB Perceived risk clearly impacts travel behavior, including destination selection and satisfaction, but it is unclear how or why its effect is only significant in certain cases. This is because existing studies have undervalued the mediating factors of risk aversion, government initiatives, and media influence as well as the multiple forms or dimensions of risk that can mask its direct effect. This study constructs a structural equation model of perceived risk's impact on destination image and travel intention for a more nuanced model of the perceived risk mechanism in tourism, based on 413 e-questionnaires regarding travel to Chengdu, China during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the Bootstrap method to analyze suppressing effect. It finds that while perceived risk has a significant negative impact on destination image and travel intention, this is complexly mediated so as to appear insignificant. Furthermore, different mediating factors and dimensions of perceived risk operate differently according to their varied combinations in actual circumstances. This study is significant because it provides a theoretical interpretation of tourism risk, elucidates the mechanisms or paths by which perceived risk affects travel intention, and expands a framework for research on destination image and travel intention into the realms of psychology, political, and communication science. It additionally encourages people to pay greater attention to the negative impact of crises and focuses on the important role of internal and external responses in crisis management, which can help improve the effectiveness of crisis management and promote the sustainable development of the tourism industry.

AB High temperature (HT) is an important factor for limiting global plant distribution and agricultural production. As the global temperature continues to rise, it is essential to clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms of alfalfa responding the high temperature, which will contribute to the improvement of heat resistance in leguminous crops. In this study, the physiological and proteomic responses of two alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) varieties contrasting in heat tolerance, MS30 (heat-tolerant) and MS37 (heat-sensitive), were comparatively analyzed under the treatments of continuously rising temperatures for 42 days. The results showed that under the HT stress, the chlorophyll content and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter (Fv/Fm) of alfalfa were significant reduced and some key photosynthesis-related proteins showed a down-regulated trend. Moreover, the content of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and the electrolyte leakage (EL) of alfalfa showed an upward trend, which indicates both alfalfa varieties were damaged under HT stress. However, because the antioxidation-reduction and osmotic adjustment ability of MS30 were significantly stronger than MS37, the damage degree of the photosynthetic system and membrane system of MS30 is significantly lower than that of MS37. On this basis, the global proteomics analysis was undertaken by tandem mass tags (TMT) technique, a total of 6,704 proteins were identified and quantified. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that a series of key pathways including photosynthesis, metabolism, adjustment and repair were affected by HT stress. Through analyzing Venn diagrams of two alfalfa varieties, 160 and 213 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that had dynamic changes under HT stress were identified from MS30 and MS37, respectively. Among these DEPs, we screened out some key DEPs, such as ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease FTSH protein, vitamin K epoxide reductase family protein, ClpB3, etc., which plays important functions in response to HT stress. In conclusion, the stronger heat-tolerance of MS30 was attributed to its higher adjustment and repair ability, which could cause the metabolic process of MS30 is more conducive to maintaining its survival and growth than MS37, especially at the later period of HT stress. This study provides a useful catalog of the Medicago sativa L. proteomes with the insight into its future genetic improvement of heat-resistance.

AB To further explore the effects of heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on silage fermentation and aerobic stability, whole-plant corn at around the 1/2 milk-line stage was freshly chopped and ensiled in laboratory silos with deionized water (control), Lactobacillus buchneri (LB), or L. rhamnosus (LR). Each treatment was prepared in triplicate for 3, 14, and 60 d of fermentation, followed by 3 and 7 days of aerobic exposure. The dynamic changes in microbial community were studied by single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. The results showed that the two LAB inoculants altered the microbial communities in different ways. Succession from L. plantarum to L. buchneri and L. rhamnosus was observed in LB- and LR-treated silage, respectively. Both silages improved aerobic stability (82 and 78 h vs. 44 h) by occupying the microbial niche to produce higher levels of acetic acid at terminal fermentation. Because Acetobacter fabarum dominated in the silages after aerobic exposure, beta diversity dramatically decreased. In this study, a. fabarum was reported for the first time in silage and was related to aerobic spoilage. The two heterofermentative LAB produced acetic acid and improved the aerobic stability of the corn silage by occupying the microbial niche at terminal fermentation. Inoculated L. rhamnosus had a greater pH for a longer period of time after opening and less DM loss at day 7.

AB Liver fibrosis is a pathological variation caused by almost all chronic liver injuries. As an edible and medicinal natural resource, Phyllanthus emblica (PE) has been reported to possess hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities and may have an ameliorating effect on hepatic fibrosis. To investigate the protective effect of the aqueous extract of PE (AEPE) against liver fibrosis and to uncover its related mechanisms, the chemical profile of AEPE was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sulfuric acid-phenol method. Ameliorative effects of different doses of AEPE were investigated in carbon-tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced liver fibrosis rats by analyzing biochemical markers, morphologic pathology, and related proteins expression in liver tissue. The results indicated that AEPE (1.8, 3.6 g/kg) could significantly reduce levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), collagen IV (Col IV), type III precollagen (PCIII), hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), protein carbonyl (PC), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and hydroxyproline (Hyp) and increase the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT). Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Sirius red, and Masson staining showed AEPE-treated improved fibrotic lesions and inflammatory cell infiltration. Meanwhile, AEPE treatment also significantly downregulates the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the liver tissue and serum, respectively. In conclusion, AEPE possesses curative efficacy against liver fibrosis through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects.

AB Combined chemo-photothermal therapy of gold nanorods (GNRs) for cancer treatment shows better therapeutic efficiency than mono-chemotherapy, which has gained worldwide interests of scientists and clinician in both laboratory and clinic application. However, high cytotoxicity, declined delivery efficiency, and unsatisfactory therapy effect of the GNRs are still challenging in anti-cancer treatment. Herein, a series of pH-sensitively zwitterionic polypeptide conjugated GNRs were synthesized via a gold-thiol interaction for combination of chemo-photothermal therapy in cervical cancer treatment. The acid-labile hydrazone bond was utilized to incorporate the doxorubicin (DOX) for pH-sensitive drug release under tumoral environment. The as prepared GNRs conjugates demonstrated pH-triggered surface charge conversion from negative to positive when transporting from blood circulation to tumor extracellular environment, which can facilitate the cellular uptake via electrostatic interaction. After cellular internalization, the drug release was promoted by cleavage of the hydrazone in GNRs conjugates under cancer intracellular acid environment. As the effective near-infrared (NIR) photothermal materials, the as prepared GNRs conjugates can absorb NIR photo energy and convert it into heat under irradiation, which can efficiently kill the tumor cells. In cell assay, the GNRs conjugates displayed excellent biocompatibility against normal cell, enhanced cancer cell uptake, and remarkable cancer cell killing effects. In HeLa tumor-bearing mice, the GNRs conjugates demonstrated enhanced tumor inhibition efficacy by combination of chemo-photothermal therapy.

AB Previous studies have indicated that individuals who believe fatalistic determinism are more depressed than other individuals. In this study, by testing the mediating roles of self-control and resilience, we aimed to investigate how fatalistic determinism is linked to depression. One sample of high school students (Study 1, N = 714) and another independent sample of college students (Study 2, N = 1569) in China completed questionnaires about fatalistic determinism, depression, self-control, and resilience. Mediation analyses were conducted with fatalistic determinism as a predictor variable, self-control and resilience as mediators, and depression as an outcome variable. In both studies, we observed a replicable pattern of results. Fatalistic determinism was positively correlated with depression. Self-control and resilience played multiple mediating roles in the association between fatalistic determinism and depression through three mediating pathways: via self-control alone, via resilience alone, and via the effect of self-control on resilience. Together, the total mediation effect accounted for approximately half of the total effect (46.2% in Study 1 and 48.5% in Study 2). In conclusion, fatalistic determinism may increase the risk of developing depression either by simultaneously decreasing self-control and resilience (parallel mediation) or by decreasing resilience via reduced self-control (serial mediation).

AB Salix cupularis is a common shrub for ecological restoration of the desertified alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. However, the effect of S. cupularis on spatial heterogeneity of soil resources (i.e., resource islands effect) has not been systematically evaluated, and the influence of shrub patches on the rehabilitation of understory herbs has also been unknown. In this study, we randomly selected S. cupularis individuals in the early restoration stage of desertified alpine meadow, where the three native forages (Elymus nutans, Elymus sibiricus and Festuca sinensis) were sown at different microsites around S. cupularis to explore the effects of S. cupularis on soil resources and emergence rates of the native forages. The results showed that S. cupularis significantly increased SWC (soil water content), C (carbon) and N (nitrogen) nutrients (p < 0.01) and enzyme activities (p 0.05) under canopy compared with the bare land, and the improvement performed better in the topsoil (0?5 cm) than in the subtop-soil (5?15 cm). Moreover, the soil properties were affected significantly by microsites around S. cupularis, resulting in regular changes of SWC, nutrients and enzyme activities in different microsites (Shrub center Middle of canopy radius > Bare land). In addition, there are significant regression relationships between emergence rates and enriching soil water, C and N nutrients, so the emergence rates of native forages under canopy may be improved significantly with the enriched soil resources, especially for E. nutans. As a result, S. cupularis is a suitable pioneer shrub for the vegetation restoration of desertified alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, because it could not only shape the enrichment of soil resources under canopy, but also facilitate emergence of companion forages in the process of vegetation restoration.

TI Identification of the Key Residues of the Uridine Diphosphate
   Glycosyltransferase 91D2 and its Effect on the Accumulation of Steviol
   Glycosides in Stevia rebaudiana

   site-mutation
AB Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) possesses substantial value for its unique sweet compounds-steviol glycosides (SGs). In the metabolic glycosylation grid of SGs, SrUGT91D2 has been shown to catalyze formation of 1,2-beta-D-glucoside linkages at the C-13- and C-19-positions and play a crucial role in the synthesis of SGs, including the formation of stevioside (ST), rebaudioside E (RE), and rebaudioside D (RD). However, the key residues of the SrUGT91D2 enzyme and how SrUGT91D2 affects the accumulation of SGs in S. rebaudiana remain unclear. In the present study, cloning and functional analysis of full-length SrUGT91D2 gene sequences were performed in 10 different S. rebaudiana genotypes with divergent SG compositions. After sequence analysis, it was found that most of the sequences of this gene (more than 50%) in each genotype were consistent with the UGT91D2e_No.5 allele, which has been reported to exert catalytic activity on 1,2-beta-D-glucoside. Moreover, six variants (UGT91D2e_No.5, SrUGT91D2-11-14, SrUGT91D2-110, SrUGT91D2-023, SrUGT91D2-N01, and SrUGT91D2-N04) of this gene were obtained, and their activities were identified. Although there were some differences among these variants, the only type of mutation was partial base substitution at a very low level. In addition, the expression analysis of SrUGT91D2 in each genotype showed that the expression level of the gene was significantly different among genotypes, and a significant positive correlation was found between the content of RD (which was closely influenced by SrUGT91D2) and the expression level of SrUGT91D2 in each genotype (correlation coefficient = 0.91). Thus, it was indicated that SrUGT91D2 was relatively conserved in S. rebaudiana, and the differential effect of SrUGT91D2 on the accumulation of related SGs mainly derived from its expression level. Furthermore, based on homologous modeling and molecular docking analysis, T84, T144, A194, 5284, E285, V286, G365, E369, R404, and G409 were predicted to be key residues in the glucosylation of SGs by SrUGT91D2. After site-mutation and enzyme assays, it was confirmed that T84, T144, R404, A194, and G409 are the key residues in the SrUGT91D2 protein, especially T144 and G409. This work provided valuable information for understanding the structure-activity relationship of the SrUGT91D2 protein and the molecular mechanism of SG accumulation in stevia.

AB For potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ferroelectrics, a critical contradictory relationship exists where higher piezoelectricity is often achieved at the cost of their Curie temperature, and this severely restricts the practical applications of these ferroelectrics. How to resolve this contradiction is one of the urgent concerns in high-temperature piezoelectric applications. Herein, a new material system, 0.965K(0.54)Na(0.46)Nb(1-x)Sb(x)O(3)-0.03Bi(0.5)Na(0.5)ZrO(3)-0.005BiFeO(3)(KNNSx-BNZ-BF, 0 <= x <= 0.03), was obtained by compositional selection. A significant progress with respect to the simultaneous realization of a larged(33)(similar to 505 pC N-1) and a highT(C)(similar to 285 degrees C) was achieved in this ferroelectric, which are superior to those of the KNN-based ferroelectrics reported to date. In addition, good temperature-independent strain properties were attained for this material due to its highT(C)values. Therefore, this KNN-based system may promote the practical application of lead-free materials in high-temperature fields.

AB Nanodiamonds (NDs) are produced with large scale and applied in many areas, thus the environmental impacts and hazards of NDs should be systematically investigated. In this study, we evaluated the interaction between detonation NDs and white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and the impact on the fungus decompositions activities. NDs did not influence the biomass gain of P. chrysosporium and the culture medium pH values. The mycelia of P. chrysosporium were destroyed upon the direct contact with NDs, while the rest retained the fibrous structure. Ultrastructural observations suggested that small aggregates of NDs seldom entered the fungus cells, but the break of cell wall and the loss of cytoplasm were induced by NDs. Under both optical and electron microscopes, the aggregation of colloidal ND particles was observed, which was the possible reason of low toxicity. High concentrations of NDs inhibited the laccase activity and manganese peroxidase activity of P. chrysosporium, which led to the decrease of decomposition activity for pollutants. Colloidal ND particles were not well dispersed in sawdust degradation evaluations, so no inhibitive effect was observed for wood degradation. The toxicological mechanism of NDs was assigned to oxidative stress. The results collectively suggested that NDs had low toxicity to white rot fungi and could be applied safely. The colloid dispersion/aggregation of nanoparticles in biological systems should be carefully considered during the design of safe nanomaterials.

AB In this work, a label-free colorimetric assay was developed for the determination of urine glucose using smartphone ambient-light sensor (ALS). Using horseradish peroxidase-hydrogen peroxide-3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (HRP-H2O2-TMB) colored system, quantitative H2O2 was added to samples to-be-determined for deepest color. The presence of glucose oxidase in urine led to the formation of H2O2 and the reduction of TMBred. As a result of this, the color of the urine faded and the solution changed from deep blue to light blue. We measured the illuminance of the transmitted light by a smartphone ambient light sensor, and thereby color changes were used to calculate the content of urine glucose. After method validation, this colorimetric assay was practically applied for the determination of urine samples from diabetic patients. Good linearity was obtained in the range of 0.039-10.000 mg/mL (R-2 = 0.998), and a limit of detection was 0.005 mg/mL. Our method was had high accuracy, sensitivity, simplicity, rapidity, and visualization, providing a new sensor to be potentially applicable for point-of-care detection of urine glucose.

AB Magnetic and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (NiCNTs-OH) were synthesized in situ via a green, facile, and efficient water-assisted chemical vapor deposition (H2O-CVD) method. Pd nanoparticles (NPs) were then anchored to the surfaces of the NiCNTs-OH and the resulting Pd/NiCNTs-OH were studied for their catalytic efficiency in the Heck reaction. Transmission electron microscopy images show that the prepared Pd/NiCNTs-OH consist of a CNT-based framework with Pd NPs of 2-4 nm and Ni NPs encapsulated by the tubes. Vibrating sample magnetometer measurements reveal that the catalysts are easily recycled by magnetic separation. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations suggest that defects and oxygen-containing groups are introduced by the H2O-CVD method, providing sufficient anchoring sites for Pd NP loading. Hence, the Pd/NiCNTs-OH exhibit excellent yields in the Heck reaction of various aryl iodides with methyl acrylate. This work thus demonstrates a green and facile method for the preparation of magnetic nano-catalysts that can be employed for various catalytic reactions.

AB In recent years, sparse unmixing has attracted significant attention, as it can effectively avoid the bottleneck problems associated with the absence of pure pixels and the estimation of the number of endmembers in hyperspectral scenes. The joint-sparsity model has outperformed the single sparse unmixing method. However, the joint-sparsity model might cause some aliasing artifacts for the pixels on the boundaries of different constituent endmembers. To address this shortcoming, researchers have developed many unmixing algorithms based on low-rank representation, which makes good use of the global structure of data. In addition, the high mutual coherence of spectral libraries strongly affects the applicability of sparse unmixing. In this study, adopting combined constraints imposing sparsity and low rankness, a novel algorithm called nonconvex joint-sparsity and low-rank unmixing with dictionary pruning is developed In particular, we impose sparsity on the abundance matrix using the l(2,p) mixed norm, and we also employ the weighted Schattenp-norm instead of the convex nuclear norm as an approximation for the rank. The key parameter p is set between 0.4 and 0.6, and a good quality sparse solution is generated. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both simulated and real hyperspectral datasets.

AB Introduction: Enrofloxacin is used in the treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections in mammals. However, its poor solubility limits the clinical use.
   Methods: In order to improve the solubility of enrofloxacin, the enrofloxacin mesylate (EM) were obtained by a chemical synthesis method. The characterization of EM was carried out using ultraviolet scan (UV), synchronous thermal analysis (SDT), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD). Acute toxicity of EM in Kunming mice was studied. Besides, pharmacokinetic studies were performed in New Zealand rabbits at a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg, and the antibacterial activity of EM was also evaluated.
   Results: EM was successfully synthesized and purified. The stoichiometric ratio of mesylate to enrofloxacin was 1:1 and the aqueous solubility of EM was 483.01 +/- 4.06 mg/mL, the solubility of EM was about 2000 times higher than enrofloxacin. The oral lethal dose (LD50) of EM was 1168.364 mg/kg, and the pharmacokinetics indicated that the oral relative bioavailability of EM was about 1.79 times and 1.48 times higher than that of enrofloxacin and enrofloxacin hydrochloride, respectively. In addition, the in vitro antibacterial activity of EM was not significantly changed compared with enrofloxacin and enrofloxacin hydrochloride.
   Conclusion: EM has higher solubility, low toxicity for oral use, and increases the oral bioavailability in rabbit. This study may be of benefit for the development of new enrofloxacin drugs.

AB The feedback between the atmosphere and permafrost soils containing large carbon stocks is currently considered the most important carbon-cycle feedback, but it is missing from climate models due to many uncertainties. Knowledge of how differences in post-thaw hydrological conditions affect carbon (C) release is critical for predicting permafrost feedback, but this knowledge remains limited. In this study, permafrost and active layer soils from the southern margin of the Eurasian boreal permafrost region in Northeast China were collected and incubated under experimentally modified moisture to monitor their CO2 and CH4 productions under simulated natural, drier and flooded conditions. We also characterized soil properties related to soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and microbial activities to determine their relations with measured C productions. We found that permafrost had higher C release per gram of SOC basis (C vulnerability) than the active layer, which suggested that there would be a high risk for C emissions in the permafrost region when permafrost thaws in the warming future. However, hydrological conditions following the permafrost thaw control these emissions. Permafrost C decomposed in relatively aerobic upland systems had higher C emissions than that decomposed in anaerobic wetland environments. Our results suggest a greater climate forcing of C release in aerobic than anaerobic conditions, but there are some uncertainties resulting from the unknown long-term CH4 production rates. Moreover, we found that the aerobic C production in permafrost after thawing could be constrained by water stress, suggesting that previous predictions based on soil incubations at natural soil moisture might overestimate the aerobic permafrost C release.

AB We demonstrated a diversity-reception lens-free underwater wireless optical communication system employing a 2x2 solar panel array as detectors. The respective relationships between solar panel sizes and photocurrents, output voltages, system bandwidths were studied theoretically and experimentally. The signals output from the array were combined via maximum ratio combining in order to improve the signal quality. A 450-nm blue laser was used in the transmitter and a light spot with a size of 20mmx35mm was formed on the receiving plane after a 7-m transmission in tap water. With the solar panel array, a data rate of 84 Mbps was achieved with a bit error rate of 2.17 x 10(-3) using 16-QAM OFDM signal. Meanwhile, a single solar panel with the same size as the array only achieved 60 Mbps. Solar panel array can bring about 40% data rate improvement. With the same detection area, the horizontal detection range of detectors increased from 37 mm for single solar panel to 55 mm for solar panel array thanks to the diversity reception. The results show that solar panel array using maximum ratio combining can enhance the transmission data rate as well as the detection range. The impacts of air bubbles, water fluctuation and microscopic particulates suspension on the proposed solar panel array-based system were also investigated. The results show that the received power sensitivity of solar panel array is 5.22 dB higher than single solar panel with the same detection area with a data rate of 60 Mbps and a BER of 10(-3).

AB Psychological resilience refers to the ability to adapt effectively in the face of adversity, which is closely related to an individual's psychological and physical health and well-being. Although previous behavioural studies have shown sex differences in psychological resilience, little is known about the neural basis of sex differences in psychological resilience. Here, we measured amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the sex-linked neurofunctional basis of psychological resilience in 231 healthy adolescents. At the behavioural level, we replicated previous findings indicating that males are more resilient than females. At the neural level, we found sex differences in the relationship between psychological resilience and ALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Specifically, males showed a positive correlation between psychological resilience and ALFF in the right OFC, while females showed a negative correlation in this region. The sex-specific association between psychological resilience and spontaneous brain activity might be dependent on differences in hormonal systems and brain development between male and female adolescents. Taken together, the results of our study might provide the first evidence of sex-specific neurofunctional substrates of psychological resilience in adolescents, emphasizing the vital role of sex effects in future psychological resilience-related studies.

AB Urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon which creates temperature distinction between cities and its ambient environment outside cities, which also increases the energy consumption of cooling during summer time. Paving surface materials account for a high proportion of cost in urban construction and contribute significantly to urban heat island. Solar-reflective materials used in paving surface alternative to traditionally absorptive materials can reduce high-temperature storage by daylight and release the storage at night. In this review, the reflective paving techniques and materials will be introduced with the analysis and description of the main thermal performance and existing developments as a tactic for effects' mitigation of UHI. Furthermore, real applications and the market barrier of these materials will be summarized. The expectation is that reflective materials on the roadways have considerable influence in the temperature's decrease in paved surfaces and ambient air during summertime, and they are proposed to be adopted especially in hot regions to retard certain influences of the urban heat island.

AB Evaluating the responses of ecosystem respiration (Re) and its components to climate change is crucial for predicting terrestrial carbon cycling, particularly for the alpine grassland ecosystems. However, effects of climatic warming on ecosystem heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra) remain poorly understood in semi-arid alpine grasslands. A field manipulative experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of experimental warming on total Re, Rh and Ra in a Tibetan semi-arid alpine steppe during growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results showed that warming decreased seasonal Re, Rh and Ra by 29%, 37% and 13%, respectively. However, warming tended to increase the contribution of Ra to Re (Ra/Re) but decrease that of Rh to Re (Rh/Re). Negative responses of Re was closely related to the changes in plant biomass and soil microbial biomass carbon. The apparent Q(10) values of Ra were higher than those of Re and Rh, with the Q(10) values ranked as Ra > Re > Rh. Warming decreased the apparent Q(10) values of Re and the two components. Our results emphasize that Re and its components respond negatively to experimental warming, and soil carbon loss has the potential to be less under future climatic warming in the Tibetan semi-arid alpine steppe.

AB This study compares the prevention effects of Shuidouchi with different fermentation times on constipation in mice. Shuidouchi is a short-time fermented soybean product. By improving its processing technology, it can incur better biological activity and become a health food. The Shuidouchi-treated mice were evaluated using constipation-related kits, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot assays. After the mice were fed 72-h-fermented Shuidouchi (72-SDC) for 9 d, the defecation time to excrete the first black stool was lower than that of the control and 24-SDC and 48-SDC groups, but was much higher than that of the normal group. The gastrointestinal (GI) transit of the small intestine of the 72-SDC group was higher than that of the control and the 24-SDC and 48-SDC groups, but lower that of the normal group. Meanwhile, 72-SDC could significantly increase the levels of ghrelin, endothelin-1 (ET-1), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the serum of constipated mice compared to the levels in mice in the control group. Moreover, 72-SDC could raise c-Kit, stem cell factor (SCF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GNDF), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression levels, and reduce transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels in small-intestinal tissue compared to the levels in the control group. Meanwhile, 72-SDC also raised ghrelin mRNA expression in gastric tissue and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) mRNA expression in colon tissue compared to the control group mice; these effects were stronger than those of 24-SDC and 48-SDC. Shuidouchi has good preventative effects on constipation and performs best when fermented for at least 72 h.

AB In this study, 98 diarrhoeic and 70 non-diarrhoeic samples were collected from 13 dairy farms located across 5 provinces in China from April 2017 to May 2018. Approximately 41.8 % (41/98) of diarrhoeic samples and 5.7% (4/70) of non-diarrhoeic samples were nebovirus-positive based on RT-PCR results, and some diarrhoeic samples were co-infected with bovine rotavirus (73.2 %), bovine coronavirus (36.6 %) and/or bovine viral diarrhoea virus (31.7 %). A phylogenetic analysis of 23 nebovirus RdRp fragments showed that these strains were closely related to Nebraska-like (NB-like) strains but were all located in a unique large branch. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis of the 18 complete VP1 sequences from this study revealed that 14 strains belonged to lineage 1 and 4 strains belonged to lineage 3. Notably, all four lineage 3 strains shared the same recombination event, with a breakpoint located within the P1A domain. The complete genome of one nebovirus strain, Bo/YLA-2/17/CH, which had a recombination event within the P1A domain of its VP1, was successfully sequenced and was found to be 7453 nt in length, and this may represent a novel nebovirus strain based on the phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome sequence. In conclusion, this study reveals that neboviruses circulate widely in dairy cows in China and exhibit a unique evolution of RdRp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported recombination event located within the P1A domain of nebovirus VP1.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are widely used in diverse areas with increasing annual production, thus the environmental impact of CNTs needs thorough investigation. In this study, we evaluated the effect of pristine multi-walled CNTs (p-MWCNTs) and oxidized multi-walled CNTs (o-MWCNTs) on white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which is the decomposer in carbon cycle and also has many applications in environmental remediation. Both p-MWCNTs and o-MWCNTs had no influence on the dry weight increase of P. chrysosporium and the pH value of culture system. The fibrous structure of P. chrysosporium was disturbed by p-MWCNTs seriously, while o-MWCNTs had litter influence. The ultrastructural changes were more evident for P. chrysosporium exposed to p-MWCNTs and only p-MWCNTs could penetrate into the cell plasma. The chemical composition of P. chrysosporium was nearly unchanged according to the infrared spectra. The laccase activity was suppressed by p-MWCNTs, while o-MWCNTs showed stimulating effect. The decoloration of reactive brilliant red X-3B was not affected by both CNT samples. However, serious inhibition of wood degradation was observed in the p-MWCNTs exposed groups, suggesting the potential threat of CNTs to the decomposition of carbon cycle. The implication to the environmental risks and safe applications of carbon nanomaterials is discussed.

AB The Zoige peatland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the largest alpine peatland in the world, is currently experiencing unprecedented water stress due to climate change and human activities. However, the consequences for emissions of greenhouse gases have not been well studied. We conducted a 40-month in situ field experiment (including deep, shallow and control water table treatments) to examine the effect of drainage on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O). The results showed that drainage significantly increased the emission rates and the total cumulative emissions of CO2 (i.e., ecosystem respiration) and N2O, and reduced CH4 emissions. However, under drained conditions, the cumulative emissions of CO2 and N2O increased significantly during the growing season (May to September) only, whereas the cumulative emissions of CH4 decreased significantly during both the growing season and the non-growing season (October to April). In addition, drainage significantly increased the biomass of aerobic bacteria and methanotrophs. These results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases in the Zoige peatland are sensitive to short-term drainage and that future studies should consider the response of greenhouse gas fluxes to environmental changes in the non-growing season.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Astragalus mongholicus Bunge (Fabaceae) is an important plant source of the herbal drug known as Radix Astragali, which is used worldwide as a medicinal ingredient and a component of food supplement. Russian Federation, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and China are the main natural distribution areas of A. mongholicus in the world. However, the quality of medicinal plant varies among different locations. As for A. mongholicus, limited literature focused on its biodiversity mechanism. Here, we combined the chemometric analysis of chemical components with genetic variation, as well as climatic and edaphic traits, to reveal the biodiversity mechanism of A. mongholicus. Results showed that the detected chemical, genetic and climatic traits comprehensively contributed to the quality diversity of A. mongholicus. The eight main chemical components, as well as the inorganic elements of P, B and Na were all significant chemical factors. The precipitation and sunshine duration were the main distinguishing climatic factors. The inorganic elements As, Mn, P, Se and Pb were the distinguishing edaphic factors. The systematic method was firstly established for this medicinal plant in order to illustrate the formation of diversity in terms of quality, and provide scientific evidence for geographic indications and climatic adaptation in production and in the clinical application of herbal medicinal plants.

AB Etching aluminum foil was prepared by electrochemical DC etching under ultrasonic superimposition. Specifically, the relationship of electrochemical behavior, interface behavior and mass transfer enhancement from ultrasound was investigated intensively by chronopotentiometry, potentiodynamic polarization, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra. Meanwhile, the etching specimens were characterized by SEM, N-2 adsorption and XRD patterns measurements. The results showed that ultrasonic agitation inhibited the growth of aluminum oxide film and facilitated pit initiation effectively via increasing the Cl- adsorption on electrolyte/aluminum oxide film interface, and strengthened the inward/outward migration of Cl- and AICI(3) within tunnels by thinning the thickness of diffusion layer and decreasing the electrolyte resistance. Moreover, the double layer capacitance C-dl, pit density, average pit size/tunnel length and its homogeneity are all enhanced under ultrasonic superimposition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hexakis(4-nitrophenoxy) cyclotriphosphazene (HNTP) was added to polycarbonate (PC) as intumescent flame retardant. In order to get high-flame-retardant PC composite with a small quantity of addition, potassium diphenylsulfone sulfonate (KSS) was added to PC as synergetic flame retardant. The flame retardancy and thermal degradation behavior of composites was investigated with limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning test, microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TG). TG coupled with FTIR (TG/FTIR) was used to research their gaseous products. Scanning electron microscopy analyses and FTIR spectrophotometer were used to study the structure of residual char. But the flammability properties of PC systems indicated the synergistic was instead of antagonistic effects. The antagonistic behaviors between HNTP and KSS were further researched by MCC, TG, and FTIR. The antagonism of KSS was quantified by Lewin M's synergistic effectiveness parameter, calculated from sample LOI data.

AB Polyurethane-encapsulated carbon black (ECB) particles were synthesized successfully through a facile method by encapsulating carbon black (CB) particles in the presence of an amphiphilic isocyanate-terminated polyurethane pre-polymer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated the existence, of a polyurethane layer on the surface of encapsulated CB, and thermo-gravimetric analysis indicated the encapsulation percentage reached 15.77 wt.%. The results of dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopy analyses revealed that the ECBs exhibited better dispersibility and stability in water in comparison with the dispersant-dispersed carbon black (DCB) prepared by simply dispersing CB particles using a polymer super-dispersant. In particular, scanning electron microscope observation of PUB/ECB composite films obtained by blending ECB particles with a waterborne polyurethane binder (PUB), showed enhanced dispersibility and compatibility of the ECBs in the PUB matrix. Therefore, as test results demonstrated, PUB/ECB composite films showed better mechanical, water resistance, and color properties compared with those of PUB/DCB composite film. It is expected that this effective encapsulation method for preparing functional CB dispersions will be used to make waterborne coatings in the leather and textile finishing fields.

AB Background: Functionalization is believed to have a considerable impact on the biodistribution of fullerene in vivo. However, a direct comparison of differently functionalized fullerenes is required to prove the hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influences of surface modification on the biodistribution of fullerene following its exposure via several routs of administration.
   Methods: C-13 skeleton-labeled fullerene C-60 (C-13-C-60) was functionalized with carboxyl groups (C-13-C-60-COOH) or hydroxyl groups (C-13-C-60-OH). Male ICR mice (similar to 25 g) were exposed to a single dose of 400 mu g of C-13-C-60-COOH or C-13-C-60-OH in 200 mu L of aqueous 0.9% NaCl solution by three different exposure pathways, including tail vein injection, gavage and intraperitoneal exposure. Tissue samples, including blood, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys, lungs, brain, large intestine, small intestine, muscle, bone and skin were subsequently collected, dissected, homogenized, lyophilized, and analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
   Results: The liver, bone, muscle and skin were found to be the major target organs for C-60-COOH and C-60-OH after their intravenous injection, whereas unmodified C-60 was mainly found in the liver, spleen and lung. The total uptakes in liver and spleen followed the order: C-60 >> C-60-COOH > C-60-OH. The distribution rate over 24 h followed the order: C-60 > C-60-OH > C-60-COOH. C-60-COOH and C-60-OH were both cleared from the body at 7 d post exposure. C-60-COOH was absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract following gavage exposure and distributed into the heart, liver, spleen, stomach, lungs, intestine and bone tissues. The translocation of C-60-OH was more widespread than that of C-60-COOH after intraperitoneal injection.
   Conclusions: The surface modification of fullerene C-60 led to a decreased in its accumulation level and distribution rate, as well as altering its target organs. These results therefore demonstrate that the chemical functionalization of fullerene had a significant impact on its translocation and biodistribution properties. Further surface modifications could therefore be used to reduce the toxicity of C-60 and improve its biocompatibility, which would be beneficial for biomedical applications.

DT Article
ID PROBABILITY; IMPACTS
AB The analysis and evaluation of agricultural drought risk can assist in reducing regional disasters and agricultural drought losses. Because of the uncertainties and incomplete agricultural drought information, this paper employed an information diffusion technology and information matrix to identify a drought disaster risk distribution and to quantify the relationship between the annual drought-affected rate and the grain production losses in China's major grain-producing areas. From the assessment results, provincial drought disaster risk spatial distribution maps for each major grain-producing area in China were obtained. These risk patterns showed that the probability of drought fell when the annual drought-covered rate and the annual drought-affected rate increased, and that the high risk areas were located primarily in China's northern and central provinces. These results can provide the basis for the development of effective drought mitigation strategies which would be able to inform possible drought situations and allow for easier decision-making on drought resistance strategies. The fuzzy relationship between the annual drought-affected rate and the drought-caused grain production losses provides vital information for the development of disaster compensation plans. Furthermore, the results of this study indicated that the proposed methods had superior detection stability and higher precision. We hope that by conducting such agricultural drought risk analysis, the results are able to provide the basis for the development of drought mitigation strategies to reduce future losses.

AB Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) has diverse bioactivities. It was hyphothesized that if PSO were employed to construct a trans-resveratrol-loaded self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (RES SNEDDS-PSO), not only could PSO serve as an oil phase but also exert synergistic effects with resveratrol to yield better therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we prepared RES SNEDDS-PSO for the first time to validate that hypothesis. The anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities of RES SNEDDS-PSO were compared with another SNEDDS composed of oil phase isopropyl palmitate (RES SNEDDS-IP). The results showed that upon exposure to a 10-fold amount of water, RES SNEDDS-PSO was converted into nanoemulsions with a mean size of 44nm. Nanoemulsions enhanced the water solubility of resveratrol by 20-fold, significantly improved resveratrol stability in intestinal fluid, and slowed the decomposition of resveratrol in water by 1-fold. An in vivo anti-infection test showed that the degree of inflammatory swelling in mice given RES SNEDDS-PSO was only 60 and 76% that of the group fed with RES SNEDDS-IP at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. An in vitro anticancer study showed that the inhibitory rate of RES SNEDDS-PSO against MCF-7 breast cancer cells was 2.03- and 1.24-fold that of RES SNEDDS-IP at a concentration of 12.5 and 251 mu g/mL, respectively. This study demonstrated that the newly developed SNEDDS may be a prospective formulation in the functional food and clinical fields.

AB Multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infection has become one of the most serious health issues due to its high mortality rate. To address this problem, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF)/polypeptide hybrid nanocomposite was synthesised for the combined chemo-photodynamic therapy of MDR bacterial infection. A lipasesensitive crosslinker was used to prepare the crosslinked polypeptide outer shell of the nanocomposite, and ciprofloxacin (CIP) and methylene blue (MB) were incorporated in the zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF)/poly & gamma;-glutamic acid (PGA) nanocomposites to form the combined therapeutic system (ZIF/PGA-C/M) for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The ZIF/PGA-C/M displayed a negative surface charge of -11.2 mV at physiological pH, indicating improved structural stability and biocompatibility. The pH/ lipase dual responsive drug release showed that up to 99.4% CIP and 76.0 % MB were released at pH 5.5 in the presence of lipase from the ZIF/PGA-C/M. Moreover, the incorporated MB can effectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) to kill the bacteria by a photodynamic effect under NIR irradiation. Remarkably, ZIF/PGA-C/M showed an efficient inhibition rate towards MRSA in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes, and a synergistic therapeutic effect against MRSA infection in the mice model of skin infection.

AB 'Chinese Cling' is an important founder in peach breeding history due to the pleasant flavor. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combined with genomic selection are promising tools in fruit tree breeding, as there is a considerable time lapse between crossing and release of a cultivar. In this study, 242 peaches from Shanghai germplasm were genotyped with 145 456 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The six agronomic traits of fruit flesh color, fruit shape, fruit hairiness, flower type, pollen sterility, and soluble solids content, along with 14 key volatile odor compounds (VOCs), were recorded for multiple-statistical GWAS. Except the reported candidate genes, six novel genes were identified as associated with these traits. Thirty-nine significant SNPs were associated with eight VOCs. The putative candidate genes were confirmed for VOCs by RNA-seq, including three genes in the biosynthesis pathway found to be associated with linalool, soluble solids content, and cis-3-hexenyl acetate. Multiple-trait genomic prediction enhanced the predictive ability for & gamma;-decalactone to 0.7415 compared with the single-trait model value of 0.1017. One PTS1-SSR marker was designed to predict the linalool content, and the favorable genotype 187/187 was confirmed, mainly existing in the 'Shanghai Shuimi' landrace. Overall, our findings will be helpful in determining peach accessions with the ideal phenotype and show the potential of multiple-trait genomic prediction to improve accuracy for highly correlated genetic traits. The diagnostic marker will be valuable for the breeder to bridge the gap between quantitative trait loci and marker-assisted selection for developing strong-aroma cultivars.

AB The NADC34-like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 2 (PRRSV-2) first emerged in China in 2017 and has the potential to become the dominant PRRSV strain in China. Here, a novel PRRSV-2, SCcd2020, was isolated from diseased piglets in Sichuan province, southwest China in 2020. The complete viral genome was determined and analyzed. An ORF5-based phylogenetic analysis showed that SCcd2020 clustered with NADC34-like strains, whereas the genome sequence clustered the isolate with NADC30-like viruses and it contains a discontinuous 131-aa deletion in NSP2 when compared to NADC30 strain. Notably, recombination analyses indicated that SCcd2020 is a multiple recombinant virus from NADC30-like, NADC34-like and JXA1-like strains, which is the first description of Chinese domestic HP-PRRSV involving the recombination event of an NADC34-like strain. Importantly, an animal challenge study in 4-week-old piglets showed that SCcd2020 causes high fever and severe hemorrhagic pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation and edema, and it has a high mortality rate (60%), which indicated that SCcd2020 is a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain. The study reports the emergence of a novel highly pathogenic NADC34-like recombinant strain, and it highlights the importance of monitoring newly emerging PRRSV strains in China.

AB Sea buckthorn pomace is a by-product of sea buckthorn products that is not effectively utilized. This study obtained sea buckthorn polysaccharides (SPs) from pomace, analyzed its structure, and investigated its regula-tory effect on the gut microbiota imbalance induced by cefixime. The results showed that SPs had an average molecular weight of 6.26 x 103 kDa and mainly consisted of galacturonic acid, galactose, and rhamnose. Biochemical analysis showed that SPs increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the abundance of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Akkermanis in the gut of cefixime-treated mice. Correlation analysis suggested that various microorganisms had a significant (p < 0.05) relationship with SCFAs. Conse-quently, the underlying mechanism of SPs in restoring cefixime-induced gut microbiota disorder may be due to the promotion of SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacteria in the gut and gut microbiota regulation, benefiting gut health. This study is significant for developing and utilizing sea buckthorn pomace.

AB Zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn2S4), as a significant visible-light-responsive photocatalyst, has become a research hotspot to tackle energy demand and environmental issues owing to its excellent properties of high stability, easy fabrication, and remarkable catalytic activity. However, its drawbacks, including low utilization of solar light and fast photoinduced charge carriers, limit its applications. Promoting the response for near-infrared (NIR) light (similar to 52% solar light) of ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts is the primary challenge to overcome. In this review, various modulation strategies of ZnIn2S4 have been described, which include hybrid with narrow optical gap materials, bandgap engineering, up-conversion materials, and surface plasmon materials for enhanced NIR photocatalytic performance in the applications of hydrogen evolution, pollutants purification, and CO2 reduction. In addition, the synthesis methods and mechanisms of NIR light-driven ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts are summarized. Finally, this review presents perspectives for future development of efficient NIR photon conversion of ZnIn2S4-based photocatalysts.

AB To reduce heating energy consumption and operating costs in winter, it is necessary to improve building insulation performance. In Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, there is a unique filling material named lonicera rupicola grass that is widely used to thermally insulate buildings. However, its thermal performance is unknown to date. Herein, the thermal conductivity of different lonicera rupicola samples with various densities is determined in this paper, and its thermal performance is compared with that of other common typical building materials in the Tibetan areas. Experimental results have shown that lonicera rupicola grass has a very low thermal conductivity. However, its performance improves with increasing packing density. In addition, as a locally and widely available plant, lonicera rupicola can be obtained at minimal cost. Therefore, as a green and ecological building material, its use in floors and roofs for buildings has the advantage of saving energy, reducing costs, and protecting the environment.

ID DEFECT PASSIVATION
AB Passivation engineering has been identified as an effective strategy to eliminate the targeted interfacial defects for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, 4-trifluorophenylammonium iodide (CF3PhAI) is presented as a multifunctional passivation agent to modify buried SnO2/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces. Upon incorporation of CF3PhAI between SnO2 and perovskite, CF3PhAI can chemically link to SnO2 via Lewis coordination and electrostatic coupling, thereby effectively passivating under-coordinated Sn and filling the oxygen vacancy. Meanwhile, CF3PhAI helps anchor PbI2 and organic cations (MA+/FA+) to control the crystallization of the perovskite. Consequently, reduced interfacial defects, homogeneous perovskite crystallites, and better energetic alignment can be simultaneously achieved. When CF3PhAI was further used to modify the perovskite/ HTL interface, the fabricated PSCs yielded an impressive power conversion efficiency of 23.06% together with negligible J-V hysteresis. The unencapsulated devices exhibited long-term stability in wet conditions (91.8% efficiency retention after 1000 h) due to the water-resistant CF3PhAI. We also achieved good light soaking stability, maintaining 86.1% of its initial efficiency after aging for 720 h. Overall, our finding provides a promising strategy for modifying the dual contact interfaces of PSCs toward improved efficiency and stability.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop a nano-drug delivery system with intelligent stimuli-responsive drug delivery in tumor microenvironment (TME). Based on chiral mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CMSN) with a chiral recognition function in our previous research, a pH-responsive CMSN (CS-CMSN) was successfully prepared by chemical modification of chitosan (CS), and the related physicochemical properties, drug release performance, potential anti-tumor effect, and biological safety were studied. The results showed that the CSCMSN were successfully modified by CS. Moreover, CS-CMSN displayed superior encapsulation ability for doxorubicin (DOX) and exhibited controllable pH-responsive drug release properties. In particular, in a physiological environment (pH 7.4/6.5), CS shielded the nanopores, prevented DOX release, and minimized side effects on normal cells. Once the CS-CMSN was exposed to the TME (pH 5.0), the pH-sensitive moiety of CS was cleaved in an acidic environment, along with the rapid release of DOX. In vitro cell experiments further proved that DOX@CS-CMSN was more strongly taken up by 4T1 cells and could enhance the toxicity to 4T1 tumor cells as well as promote cell apoptosis. More importantly, CS-CMSN were shown to have good biosafety in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the delivery of DOX by CS-CMSN nanocarriers is a promising strategy for tumor-targeted therapy.

AB In the study, the structural features and hypoglycemic effects of a polysaccharide Pan from the root of Panax notoginseng were investigated. The molecular weight of Pan was 8.27 kDa. Structural analysis indicated that Pan mainly consisted of -> 3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1 ->, -> 3,6)-beta-D-Galf-(1 -> and -> 6)-beta-D-Galf-(1 -> residues with acetyl groups. Pan exhibited good antioxidant activity. Pan could slow down the body weight and the content of blood glucose in the high-fat diet-induced mice, further suppress GLUT-2 and SGLT-1 expression in the intestines, and enhance p-IRS and p-AMPK expression in the livers, finally exhibiting hypoglycemic effects. The results could supply a direction for further research on polysaccharides as components for the control of hyperglycemia induced by obesity and diabetes.

AB Methane-selective continuous conversion to methanol is highly challenged by the high C-H dissociation energy and the facile over-oxidation of methane. In this work, we reported continuous methane conversion to methanol over Cu-zeolites using water as the oxidant at different reaction temperatures (200-450 ?) and found that the space-time yield (STY) of methanol depended on the reaction temperature, with a high methanol STY of 189.9 mu mol/g(cat)./h (578.7 mmol/mol(Cu)/h) at the selectivity of 91 % on Cu-SSZ-13 being achieved at the optimal temperature of 350 ?. Increasing the reaction temperature from 200 to 350? resulted in the increase of the kinetic orders of methane and water for catalytic oxidation of methane. An important reason was indicated that higher reaction temperatures not only enhanced a high methane conversion rate but also triggered the reactivity of more Cu species on Cu-zeolites based on the quantification analysis of the available active sites and in-situ spectroscopic study. It was revealed that the CuxOy clusters (e.g., [Cu-2(mu-O)](2+)) as the active sites exhibited the reactivity at 200 ?, while the Cu(II)-OH species on 8-membered rings and the isolated Cu2+ ions on 6 -membered rings presented the reactivity at higher temperatures (>= 300 ?). This could be attributed to higher activation energies of Cu(II)-OH species and isolated Cu(II) sites. Besides, isotope labeling experiments indicated that the combination of methyl and hydrogen dissociated from water and methanol reforming resulted in a low methanol yield at high temperatures (>= 350 ?).

AB With the world's rapidly growing urbanization, urban sustainability is now expected for urban life. Due to this rapid growth, meeting the emerging challenges for urban management and sustainability worldwide is challenging. Big data-driven technologies can be an excellent solution to address these upcoming challenges. Therefore, this study explores the potential of big data technologies for ensuring sustainability in urban management. The study conducted a systematic literature review guided by PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis) on publications over the last 21 years. The study argues that urban management is an integrated function of public and private agencies to address the significant challenges of urban life and to develop the city as more competitive, habitable, and sustainable. Urban management can utilize big data analytics (BDA) for digital instrumentation, data-informed policy decisions, governance, real-time management, and evidence-based decisions. Urban sustainability can ensure the smooth operation of urban affairs through strategic planning under three major dimensions: social, economic, and environmental. Big data technologies can ensure smart transport, traffic, waste management, energy, environment, infrastructure, safety, healthcare, planning, and citizen participation in regular urban affairs to provide a better urban life. This study develops several indicators that will be helpful for concerned stakeholders in policy, planning, designing, and implementing sustainable urban development.

AB The gut microbiota is a large symbiotic microorganism community located in the human digestive tract. It plays a profound role in human health by modulating multiple life functions, such as immune development, metabolism regulation, and nutrient absorption. Alterations in the gut microbiota may influence the host health. Recently, the wide application of nanomaterials in every aspect of human life has increased the opportunity of exposure of gut microbiota to nanomaterials, which has led to public concern regarding the consequence of contact between nanomaterials and the gut microbiota. Herein, we attempt to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances and theories regarding occurrence mechanisms in this field of study. In this work, we first utilize the Web of Science (WOS) innate function and bibliometric methods to identify annual publication trends, the most popular nanomaterials, and popular topics of research interests in this field. Related studies on nanomaterialmediated gut microbiota alterations and their bio-effects are summarized. More importantly, the possible occurrence mechanisms of the effects, based on the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials, are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and future development directions are proposed. It is hoped that such a review will be helpful in identifying current research trends, providing an in-depth understanding of biological effects, and further promoting the development of this important field.

AB Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a viral disease that causes substantial yield loss, especially in China's summer planted maize area. Discovery of resistance genes would help in developing high-yielding resistant maize hybrids. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have advanced quickly and are now a powerful tool for dissecting complex genetic architectures. In this study, the disease severity index (DSI) of 292 maize inbred lines and an F6 linkage population were investigated across multiple environments for two years. Using the genotypes obtained from the Maize SNP 50K chip, a GWAS was performed with four analytical models. The results showed that 22 SNPs distributed on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 were significantly associated with resistance to MRDD (P<0.0001). The SNPs on chromosomes 3, 6 and 8 were consistent with the quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions from linkage mapping in an RIL population. Candidate genes identified by GWAS included an LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (GRMZM2G141288), and a DRE-binding protein (GRMZM2G006745). In addition, we performed an allele variation analysis of the SNP loci selected by GWAS and linkage mapping and found that the main alleles of the two SNP loci PZE_101170408 and PZE_106082685 on chromosome 1 differed in terms of disease-resistant materials and disease-susceptible materials. The identified SNPs and genes provide useful information for MRDD-related gene cloning and insights on the underlying disease resistance mechanisms, and they can be used in marker-assisted breeding to develop MRDD-resistant maize.

AB Heavy metals seriously endanger human health. However, simultaneous and efficient removal of heavy metals from wastewater has always been a technical challenge. For this purpose, we developed a self-sustained bioelectrical reduction system (SBRS) for the efficient purification of heavy metal wastewater. A novel iron-manganese doped metal-organic framework membrane (FM-MOFM) based on conductive substrate is used as the catalytic cathode electrode. The performances of the SBRS assisted FM-MOFM for heavy metals reduction and self-energy generation for the treatment of simulated electroplating wastewater were investigated. The FM-MOFMs were characterized before and after operation by SEM, XRD, XPS and other methods. Copper, zinc, chromium, nickel heavy metal ions are almost completely removed by the SBRS (removal efficiency: Copper ion 99.9%, Zinc ion 99.9%, Chromium ion 99.7% and Nickel ion 99.8%). Moreover, the organic substrates in the wastewater were removed simultaneously and efficiently (removal efficiency: COD 95.3%, NH4+-N 99.9%, TP 95.9%), with the maximum power density of 1.6 W m(-3). The possible electroreduction and electroflocculation mechanism of heavy metal ions can be understood by the characterization of the membrane electrode surface and precipitate. The study confirms that the SBRS is a potential and efficient candidate for the simultaneous removal of heavy metals from electroplating wastewater.

AB Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are novel fluorescent nanomaterials for applications in diverse areas. With the rapid developments in past decade, the toxicity and environmental safety of CQDs have aroused great interest. In this study, we evaluated the toxicity and impact of CQDs to white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, an important fungus for carbon cycle that degrades lignin. Red emissive CQDs slightly stimulated the growth of P. chrysosporium at 50 and 100 mu g/mL. CQD aggregates heterogeneously distributed in fungus balls, where the tightly contacted mycelia lost their fibrous structure. Cell wall damage and the detachment of membrane were observed in ultrastructural investigations. CQDs did not affect the laccase and manganese peroxidase activities of P. chrysosporium. The decomposition activity of P. chrysosporium kept unchanged by CQDs according to dye decoloration, sawdust weight loss, and sawdust lignin content. CQDs initiated the protective pathways of P. chrysosporium against oxidative stress, leading to the increases of glutathione and catalase levels and the decreases of malondialdehyde and H2O2 levels. The fluorescence quenching of CQDs in P. chrysosporium implied the biotransformation of CQDs during the one-month incubation. Our results collectively suggested that CQDs were of low toxicity and environmental impacts to white rot fungi.

AB Bimetallic nitrides are regarded as promising electrode material for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) via electrochemical water splitting. We fabricated two types of bimetallic nitride nanopore arrays based on the anodized TiO2 nanotube array template (NiTiNx@TiN, CoTiNx@TiN). The NiTiNx@TiN composite nanotubes exhibit superior HER performance compared to single metal nitrides, the thin film counterpart, and cobalt titanium nitride nanopore arrays. The enhancement can be attributed to the large electrochemical reactive surfaces and the conductive TiN nanopores as both scaffold and current transporter. The first-principle calculation indicates that the coordination states of Ni-Ti atoms favor the adsorption of the intermediate during the hydrogen production process. Such nanopore arrays should be also useful in OER and supercapacitors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) is considered one of the most valuable plants because of the steviol glycosides (SGs) that can be extracted from its leaves. Glycosyltransferases (GTs), which can transfer sugar moieties from activated sugar donors onto saccharide and nonsaccharide acceptors, are widely distributed in the genome of S. rebaudiana and play important roles in the synthesis of steviol glycosides. Results Six stevia genotypes with significantly different concentrations of SGs were obtained by induction through various mutagenic methods, and the contents of seven glycosides (stevioboside, Reb B, ST, Reb A, Reb F, Reb D and Reb M) in their leaves were considerably different. Then, NGS and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing were combined to analyse leaf tissue from these six different genotypes to generate a full-length transcriptome of S. rebaudiana. Two phylogenetic trees of glycosyltransferases (SrUGTs) were constructed by the neighbour-joining method and successfully predicted the functions of SrUGTs involved in SG biosynthesis. With further insight into glycosyltransferases (SrUGTs) involved in SG biosynthesis, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method was used to characterize the relationships between SrUGTs and SGs, and forty-four potential SrUGTs were finally obtained, including SrUGT85C2, SrUGT74G1, SrUGT76G1 and SrUGT91D2, which have already been reported to be involved in the glucosylation of steviol glycosides, illustrating the reliability of our results. Conclusion Combined with the results obtained by previous studies and those of this work, we systematically characterized glycosyltransferases in S. rebaudiana and forty-four candidate SrUGTs involved in the glycosylation of steviol glucosides were obtained. Moreover, the full-length transcriptome obtained in this study will provide valuable support for further research investigating S. rebaudiana.

AB Yak is an important livestock animal for the people indigenous to the harsh, oxygen-limited Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Hindu Kush ranges of the Himalayas. The yak genome was sequenced in 2012, but its assembly was fragmented because of the inherent limitations of the Illumina sequencing technology used to analyse it. An accurate and complete reference genome is essential for the study of genetic variations in this species. Long-read sequences are more complete than their short-read counterparts and have been successfully applied towards high-quality genome assembly for various species. In this study, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale yak genome assembly (BosGru_PB_v1.0) constructed with long-read sequencing and chromatin interaction technologies. Compared to an existing yak genome assembly (BosGru_v2.0), BosGru_PB_v1.0 shows substantially improved chromosome sequence continuity, reduced repetitive structure ambiguity, and gene model completeness. To characterize genetic variation in yak, we generated de novo genome assemblies based on Illumina short reads for seven recognized domestic yak breeds in Tibet and Sichuan and one wild yak from Hoh Xil. We compared these eight assemblies to the BosGru_PB_v1.0 genome, obtained a comprehensive map of yak genetic diversity at the whole-genome level, and identified several protein-coding genes absent from the BosGru_PB_v1.0 assembly. Despite the genetic bottleneck experienced by wild yak, their diversity was nonetheless higher than that of domestic yak. Here, we identified breed-specific sequences and genes by whole-genome alignment, which may facilitate yak breed identification.

AB The merits of Li-O-2 batteries due to the huge energy density are shadowed by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen redox and massive side reactions caused by conductive carbon and a binder. Herein, Fe-Co inverse spinel oxide nanowires grown on Ni foam are fabricated as carbon-free and binder-free cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries. Superior high rate cycle durability and deep charge capability are obtained. For example, 300 cycles with a low overpotential under a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) are achieved at a high current density of 500 mA g(-1). In the deep discharge/charge mode at 500 mA g(-1), the optimized Fe-Co oxide cathode can stably work for more than 30 cycles with the capacity maintained at about 2100 mAh g(-1). Owing to the appreciable incorporation of Fe3+ into the surface of stable inverse spinel oxides, the regulated Fe-Co oxide cathodes possess a more stable and higher ratio of Co3+/Co2+, which offers improved adsorption ability of reactive oxygen intermediates and thus achieves the enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the higher current density. In addition, the morphology evolution from array to pyramid-like structure of nanowires further provides assurance in the superior cycle capability. By coupling pyramid-shaped nanowires with binary inverse spinel, the obtained Fe-Co oxide becomes a promising material for practical applications in Li-O-2 batteries. This work offers a general strategy to design efficient mixed metal oxide-based electrodes for the critical energy storage fields.

AB The rigidity of nanoparticles was newly reported to influence their oral delivery. Semi-elastic nanoparticles can enhance the penetration in mucus and uptake by epithelial cells. However, it is still challenging and unclear that the semi-elastic core-shell nanoparticles can enhance the oral bioavailability of peptide drugs. This study was for the first time to validate the semi-elastic core-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as the carrier of the oral peptide drug. The antihypertensive peptide Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro (VP5) loaded LNPs (VP5-LNPs) were prepared by a modified thin-film ultrasonic dispersion method. Uptake experiment was performed in Caco-2 and HT29 cells and monitored by high content screening (HCS) and flow cytometric (FCM). Pharmacokinetics of VP5-LNPs was carried out in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and analyzed by DAS 2.0. The optimal VP5-LNPs had an average particle size of 247.3 +/- 3.8 nm, zeta potential of -6.57 +/- 0.45 mV and excellent entrapment efficiency (EE) of 89.88%+/- 1.23%. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) further confirmed the core-shell structure. VP5-LNPs could increase the cellular uptake in vitro and have a 2.55-fold increase in AUC0-72h, indicating a great promotion of the oral bioavailability. The semi-elastic LNPs remarkably improved the oral availability of peptide and could be a promising oral peptide delivery system for peptide drugs in the future.

AB Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a severe respiratory and digestive tract disease of domestic small ruminants caused by PPR virus (PPRV) of the genus Morbillivirus. Although the primary hosts of PPRV are goats and sheep, the host range of PPRV has been continuously expanding and reported to infect various animal hosts over the last decades, which could bring a potential challenge to effectively control and eradicate PPR globally. In this review, we focused on current knowledge about host expansion and interspecies infection of PPRV and discussed the potential mechanisms involved.

AB The systemic toxicity, reduced cellular internalization, and uncontrollable intracellular drug release of smart nanoparticles (NPs) still need to be overcome for effective cancer therapy. Herein, a series of stepwise dual pH and redox responsive cross-linked polypeptides based on poly(L-lysine-co-N,Nbis(acryloyl)cystamine-co-g-glutamic acid) (PLBG), were prepared for enhanced cellular uptake and effective cancer therapy. The prepared cross-linked PLBG nanoparticles (PLBG-NPs) exhibit negatively charged surfaces under physiological conditions, and the surface charge of the PLBG-NPs was observed to switch from negative to positive in a slightly acidic tumor extracellular environment at a pH level of similar to 6.5. Finally, the endosome escape of the PLBG-NPs was facilitated via a "proton-sponge" effect via protonation of the polymer chain in the endo/lysosome environment of the tumor cell at a pH level of similar to 5.0. Moreover, rapid drug release was triggered by a high concentration of reducing glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells via destruction of the disulfide linkages in the PLBG-NPs. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that no noticeable cytotoxicity was observed for the PLBG-NPs. However, DOX-loaded PLBG-NPs (PLBG-NPs-DOX) demonstrated remarkable tumor cell killing effects. In HeLa tumor-bearing mice, PLBG-NPs-DOX showed sustained tumor accumulation and enhanced inhibitory effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis. In conclusion, it is suggested that the as-designed novel charge-conversion PLBG-NPs with stepwise pH-responsivity and biodegradability could be used as a potential drug carrier for effective cancer therapy with less systemic toxicity.

AB For megacities experiencing rapid urbanization in China, urban growth boundaries (UGBs) have been considered as a useful means to control urban sprawl and to promote sustainable urban development. However, scientific methods and tools to delineate sound UGBs by planners are few and far between. Using metropolitan Chengdu as the study area, this paper applies the system dynamics (SD) and conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent (CLUE-s) models to delineate UGBs. In this study, land use demand was simulated in the SD model temporally at a macro-level and allocated in the CLUE-s model spatially at a micro-level. Key social-economic elements and spatial pattern factors were used in the simulation process for the period of 2013-2030. The simulation results under various scenarios showed that areas along the major corridors and belt roads of the main Chengdu metropolitan area and its satellite towns have higher chances to be developed. The areas most likely to be developed were used to establish the UGBs for 2020, 2025, and 2030. This research demonstrates that the integrated framework of SD and CLUE-s models provides a feasible means of UGB delineation under different development scenarios.

AB Soil microbial communities have been considered indicators of soil quality and fertility changes in restored ecosystems. Little is known, however, about how these communities change over time after restoration in terms of activity, structure, and diversity. We evaluated the soil bacterial communities of 4-, 8-, and 12-year-old Elymus nutans revegetated grasslands located in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Soil bacterial diversity and composition significantly changed in the 8- and 12-year-old grasslands compared with the 4-year-old grassland. Surprisingly, soil bacterial communities transitioned from Proteobacteria- and Acidobacteria-dominant communities in the 4-year-old grassland to Cyanobacteria-dominant communities in the 8- and 12-year-old grasslands. Furthermore, the phylum of Cyanobacteria accounted for a high percentage of bacterial community (>48%) in the 8- and 12-year-old grasslands. Network analyses showed that most of the interactions were identified as positive among bacterial species, but Cyanobacteria were often negatively associated with other species. In addition, there was a slight increase in P acquisition enzymes (acid phosphatase activity) and a decline in N acquisition enzymes (soil urease and nitratase activities) with the increasing dominance of Cyanobacteria. Additionally, soil pH and total phosphorus had positive relationships with soil bacterial composition and diversity, whereas soil bacterial diversity and P acquisition enzymes were negatively related to soil bacterial composition. Overall, our results indicated that significant changes in soil bacterial communities might occur in response to the cultivation period of cultivated grassland and highlighted the importance of soil pH, TP, and P acquisition enzymes in microbe-mediated ecological processes of cultivated grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB Globally, mycotoxins in food and feed are serious threats to the health of human and animals. Ergot alkaloids (EAs) are frequently detected in barley as well as other cereals. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of applying NIR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy for the determination of major EAs in cool-season barley samples grown under cold climate condition in western Canada. Sixty-seven cool-season barley samples were collected from Western Canada and analyzed for six major EAs by LC-MS/MS technique. Forty-nine barley samples were positive for EAs. The mean concentrations of ergocornine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergometrine, ergosine, ergotamine, and the sum-total EAs in positive barley samples were 120.9, 554.8, 235.6, 411.0, 127.4, 351.2, and 1150.5 mu g/kg, respectively. The NIR (680-2500 nm) and MIR (4000-700 cm(-1)) spectra of cool season barley samples were collected and calibrated with EAs reference values using PLS regression technique based on different spectral preprocessing methods and selected wavelengths. Results showed that most of the constructed models obtained weak calibration and cross-validation parameters and none of the models was able to accurately predict external samples. The relatively low levels of EAs in the contaminated barley samples might be lower than the detection limit of the conventional MR and ATR-FT/MIR spectroscopy. More efforts are needed to study the determination limit of molecular spectroscopic techniques in detecting EAs in cereal grain grown under the cold climate condition.

With the aid of discretized Lyapunov method, a reduced-order impulsive controller is designed, which just works on the slow state variables to stabilize SWSs at impulsive instant. Based on the designed controller, it is shown that the stabilization of SWSs is achieved in two cases: all unstable subsystems with stabilizing impulses and all stable subsystems even with destabilizing impulses. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we report a novel type of smart graphene oxide nanocomposites (MGO@PNB) with excellent magnetism and high thermosensitive ion-recognition selectivity of lead ions (Pb2+). The MGO@PNB are fabricated by immobilizing superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6 acrylamide) thermosensitive microgels (PNB) onto graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets using a simple one-step solvothermal method and mussel-inspired polydopamine chemistry. The PNB are composed of cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chains with numerous appended 18-crown-6 units. The 18-crown-6 units serve as hosts that can selectively recognize and capture Pb2+ from aqueous solution, and the PNIPAM chains act as a microenvironmental actuator for the inclusion constants of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ host-guest complexes. The loaded Fe3O4 NPs endow the MGO@PNB with convenient magnetic separability. The fabricated MGO@PNB demonstrate remarkably high ion-recognition selectivity of Pb2+ among the coexisting metal ions because of the formation of stable 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes. Most interestingly, the MGO@PNB show excellent thermosensitive adsorption ability toward Pb2+ due to the incorporation of PNIPAM functional chains on the GO. Further thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of Pb2+ onto the MGO@PNB is a spontaneous and endothermic process. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm data can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Most importantly, the Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB can be more easily regenerated by alternatively washing with hot/cold water than the commonly used regeneration methods. Such multifunctional graphene oxide nanocomposites could be used for specific recognition and removal of Pb2+ from water environment.

AB Hyper-branched polymer (HBP) is extensively used in chrome tanning of leather as high chrome exhaustion auxiliary. In this paper, the promoting tanning effect of tanning pickled pelt is compared with different auxiliary, carboxyl-terminated HBP (CHBP-Cr), gallic acid (GA-Cr), and citric acid (CA-Cr), respectively. The results show that using of CHBP can endow the wet-blue leather up to 95.2% chrome uptake much higher than gallic acid (89.5%) and citric acid (79.3%) and control trial (69.3%). Furthermore, the thermal degradation stability and hydrothermal stability, which including denaturation temperature and enthalpy are also improved compared to blank trial. In order to explore the mechanism of CHBP acting in, the adding timing of CHBP, chrome concentration variation during the tanning process, the alkaline stability of CHBP as well as chrome distribution in wet-blue leather are also investigated. It is found that CHBP could expert its optimum effect when adding in the pickling process. In which, CHBP could act as excellent masking agent with good alkaline stability, which slow down the basification process and make the chrome dispersed evenly along the collagen. Moreover, the increased crosslinking density of collagen fibers could stabilize chrome and inhibit outward diffusion of chrome. These results lay a foundation of developing high exhausted chrome agent for clean chrome tanning.

AB Although affiliation with deviant peers is among the most salient risk factors for college students' maladjustment, few studies have examined the possible peer contagion processes for problematic Internet use and the underlying mechanisms explaining how peer factors may shape the development of problematic Internet use. Based on data from 2516 Chinese undergraduate students (mean age = 18.56 years, SD = 0.84; 38.16% female) across their four college years and utilizing lagged latent difference score analyses, this study tested a process model to elucidate how peer Internet overuse and peer pressure on Internet use may contribute to Chinese under-graduates problematic Internet use via shaping their maladaptive cognitions over Internet use. Results indicated that peer Internet overuse predicted subsequent increases in students' peer pressure on Internet use, which in turn, were linked with students' elevated problematic Internet use via maladaptive cognitions over Internet use. This dynamic cascade process was robust even after considering a series of potential confounding variables and the prospective associations among the key variables of interest. Such findings shed light on the peer contagion processes for the development of Chinese college students' problematic Internet use, and provide empirical evidence supporting the call for integrating peer factors into prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of college students' problematic Internet use.

AB Background: Coptis chinensis Franch is extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diabetes and dementia. Alkaloids are the main active ingredients of C chinensis.
   Purpose: This study was designed to probe the effects and possible mechanisms of the total alkaloids from C. chinensis (TAC) on cognitive deficits in type 2 diabetic rats.
   Methods: Cognitive deficits were induced in rats by streptozotocin and high glucose/high fat diet. After treatment with TAC (80, 120, and 180 mg/kg) for 24 weeks, the behavioral parameters of each rat were assessed by Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. The indexes of glucose and lipid metabolism, pathological changes of brain tissue, and the phosphorylation levels of insulin signaling related proteins were also evaluated.
   Results: The type 2 diabetic rats showed significantly elevated levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and glycosylated serum protein, as well as apolipoprotein B, free fatty acid, triglyceride and total cholesterol but decreased the content of apolipoprotein Al, and TAC treatment dose-dependently reversed these abnormal changes. Furthermore, the behavioral results showed that TAC alleviated the cognitive deficits in type 2 diabetic rats. Moreover, inununohistochemical and histopathologic examinations indicated that the diabetic rats showed significant A beta deposition, and neuronal damage and loss, which can be reversed by TAC treatment. The western blot results showed that TAC treatment markedly increased the phosphorylation of IRS, PI3K, and Akt, and inhibited the overactivation of GSK3 beta in the brain of type 2 diabetic rats.
   Conclusion: These findings conclude that TAC prevents diabetic cognitive deficits, most likely by ameliorating the disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism, attenuating Ail deposition, and enhancing insulin signaling.

AB This paper investigates the contract mechanism design for a supply chain under information asymmetry. Specifically, the study considers a supply chain consisting of one risk neutral retailer and one risk-neutral supplier who has private production cost. First, we use a screening contract under information asymmetry as a benchmark. Then we propose a newly designed contract that includes the order quantity and the newly designed transfer payment, structure encompassing compensation, reward and balance parameter. This approach to the transfer payment motivates the supplier to reveal information truthfully and internalize the supply chain parties as a whole. Based on the transfer payment, we propose a new menu of contracts, and we compare the supply chain performance under two different contracts. We show that our new model achieves the first-best performance, and improve the two parties' profits if the supplier's unit information rent does not exceed an upper bound. The increasing reservation profit of the supplier decreases the lower bound and the upper bound of the balance parameter. The supplier with a higher production cost prefers a smaller balance parameter whereas the retailer prefers a larger one. The length of intervals of the supply chain's profit improvement decreases in the balance parameter. Finally, we present a numerical example to illustrate the main results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB An enantioselective (52-98% ee) Michael addition between cyclic beta-diones and alpha,beta-unsaturated enones was established in the presence of quinine-based primary amine or squaramide. A variety of cinnamones were smoothly converted into the desired 3,4-dihydropyrans in moderate to high yields (63-99%). Chalcones were also suitable acceptors and gave rise to the expected adducts in satisfactory yields (31-99%). The resulting adducts readily underwent further modification to form fused 4H-pyran or 2,3-dihydrofuran.

AB To examine the relationships between trauma exposure, fear, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sleep problems in adolescents, 746 adolescent survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China were assessed at 1 year (T1) and 1.5 years (T2) after the earthquake using a trauma exposure questionnaire, a fear questionnaire, a child posttraumatic stress disorder symptom scale, and a subscale on child sleep problems. The results showed that T1 trauma exposure were not directly associated with sleep problems at T1 and T2, but played a positive role in sleep problems at both T1 and T2 indirectly through T1 posttraumatic stress disorder and T1 fear. T1 trauma exposure was also positively and indirectly associated with T2 sleep problems through T1 posttraumatic stress disorder via T1 sleep problems, or through T1 fear via the path from T1 posttraumatic stress disorder to T1 sleep problems. These findings indicated that fear and posttraumatic stress disorder 1 year after the earthquake played a mediating role in the relationship between trauma exposure at 1 year after the earthquake, and sleep problems at both 1 year and 1.5 years after the earthquake, respectively. In particular, posttraumatic stress disorder also had a multiple mediating effect in the path from trauma exposure to sleep problems via fear. Furthermore, the findings indicated that sleep problems were relatively stable between 1 and 1.5 years after an earthquake.

   compensated interpolation (MCI); Average texture variation (ATV)
ID MOTION
AB Frame rate up-conversion (FRUC) refers to frame interpolation between adjacent video frames to increase the motion continuity of low frame rate video, which can improve the visual quality on hand-held displays. However, FRUC can also be used for video forgery purposes such as splicing two videos with different frame-rates. We found that most FRUC approaches introduce visual artifacts into texture regions of interpolated frames. Based on this observation, a two-stage blind detection approach is proposed for video FRUC based on the frame-level analysis of average texture variation (ATV). First, the ATV value is computed for each frame to obtain an ATV curve of candidate video. Second, the ATV curve is further processed to highlight its periodic property, which indicates the existence of FRUC operation and further estimates the original frame rate. Thus, the positions of interpolated frames can be inferred as well. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed forensics approach is efficient and effective for the detection of existing typical FRUC approaches such as linear frame averaging and motion-compensated interpolation (MCI). The detection performance is superior to the existing approaches in terms of time efficiency and detection accuracy.

AB Core@shell structures of Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Tm nanoparticles (NPs) with multifunctional properties were prepared using a hydrothermal route with a seed-growth procedure. The effect of Mn2+ ions on the phase, shape, and upconversion luminescence (UCL) of Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Tm NPs was explored using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, hydrophobic to hydrophilic surface modification of the Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Tm NPs was achieved by coating the NPs with an amphiphilic polymer (poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (C18PMH)) modified with amine-functionalized methyl ether poly(ethylene glycol). Then, the NIR-to-NIR UCL ascribed to the Tm(3+)ions, T-1-weighted MRI ascribed to the Mn2+ ions, and T-2-weighted MRI ascribed to the Fe3O4 core of the hydrophilic Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Tm NPs were evaluated. The results indicate that Mn2+ doping is an effective method to control the size/shape and improve the UCL intensity of Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Tm NPs, which are promising as imaging agents for NIR-to-NIR UCL and T-1/T-2-weighted MRI in biomedical research.

AB Aim: The study aimed to assess the effect of exercise intervention on the management of obese T2DM patients.
   Methods: The literature retrieval was conducted in relevant databases from their inception to 2015, with predefined searching strategy and selection criteria. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was utilized to assess the quality of included studies. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with its corresponding 95% CI (confidence interval) was used as the effect size.
   Results: A subset of 13 eligible studies was selected. Exercise significantly reduced the concentration of high sensitivity C reactive protein (4 months: WMD = -1.03, 95% CI: -1.77 to -0.29, P<0.01), triglyceride (6 months: WMD = -24.75, 95% CI: -27.67 to -21.83, P < 0.01), diastolic blood pressure (6 months: WMD = -2.70, 95% CI: -4.12 to -1.28, P=0.0002), systolic blood pressure (WMD=-7.98, 95% CI: -9.87 to -6.08, P<0.01)), HbA(1c) (4 months: WMD = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.02, P=0.04) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (3 months: WMD = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.01, P=0.04); and a pronounced increase of HDL-C (12 months: WMD=3.57, 95% CI: 1.92 to 5.21, P < 0.01).

AB Batch and soil column experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of KH2PO4, (NH4) H2PO4 and Ca(H2PO4)(2) on the adsorption and leaching characteristics of Cu and Zn in red soil. The results show that all the three phosphates can greatly improve the adsorption capacity of red soil for Cu and Zn, and the effect of different phosphates on Cu and Zn adsorption follows the order of Ca(H2PO4)(2) >KH2PO4>(NH4)H2PO4. The addition of phosphate has little effect on the mobility of Cu. Ca(H2PO4)(2) and (NH4)H2PO4 show a strong ability in immobilizing Zn while the immobilization ability of KH2PO4 is much weaker. All the three phosphates are helpful for modifying the partitioning of Cu and Zn from the non-residual phase to the residual phase; however, they could also enhance the contents of Cu and Zn associated with exchangeable and carbonates fractions.

AB Cobalt-iron-codoped ZnO films were synthesized with different precursor sol pHs by a sol-gel method. All the samples possess hexagonal wurtzite structure, with no evidence of secondary phases. The average crystallite size of the samples was in the range of 10-40 nm, accompanying significant differences with the increase of the H+ ion level. The Co/Fe ions are indeed substituted at the Zn2+ site into the ZnO lattice, as shown by XRD and XPS. Strong ultraviolet emission, blue double emission and weak green emission peaks are observed in the photoluminescence spectra of all samples at room temperature. Further studies reveal that the bandgap energy of the ZnO films increases from 3.15 eV (pH = 5) to 3.24 eV (pH = 9). Enhanced room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed for the (Co, Fe)-codoped ZnO films at sol pHs lower than 8. Our work clearly establishes that the origin of room-temperature ferromagnetism in the (Co, Fe)-codoped ZnO films is linked to O vacancies, tunable by the sol pH. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a crucial role in regulating signal recognition and transduction through their activation. The conformation transition in the activation pathway is of particular importance for their function. However, it has been poorly elucidated due to experimental difficulties in determining the conformations and the time limitation of conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) simulation. Thus, in this work, we employed a targeted molecular dynamic (TMD) simulation to study the activation process from an inactive structure to a fully active one for beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). As a reference, 110 ns CMD simulations on wild beta 2AR and its D130N mutant were also carried out. TMD results show that there is at least an intermediate conformation cluster in the activation process, evidenced by the principal component analysis and the structural and dynamic differences of some important motifs. It is noteworthy that the activation of the ligand binding site lags the G-protein binding site, displaying uncoupled correlation. Comparisons between the CMD and TMD results show that the D130N mutation significantly speeds up ICL2 and key ionic lock to enter into the intermediate state, which to some extent facilitates the activation involved in the NPxxY, DRY region and the separation between TM3 and TM6. However, the contribution from the D130N mutation to the activation of the ligand binding site could not be observed within the scale of 110 ns time. These observations could provide novel insights into previous studies for better understanding of the activation mechanism for beta 2AR.

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has become widely adopted across the healthcare sector, offering transformative benefits. By utilizing a range of wearable medical devices and cloud servers, IoMT enables the rapid transmission of data over networks, which supports timely health monitoring and data-driven decision- making. In recent years, some applications have used the Large Language Model (LLM) to assist in diagnosis, significantly improving diagnostic efficiency in IoMT. However, secure transmission of sensitive medical information remains a key concern. To address this, we propose a multi-receiver certificateless searchable public key encryption (mCLSPE) scheme that leverages proxy re-encryption. This scheme not only addresses the inherent issues in searchable public key encryption (SPE) but also allows for more flexible addition of receivers and enhances data-sharing flexibility. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model. The performance analysis shows that it has ideal comprehensive performance. The growth rate of communication overhead with the increase in users is significantly lower compared to other mCLSPE schemes. Finally, we design a specific IoMT assisted by LLM application scenario based on this scheme.

AB Ethylene glycol (EG) is one of the most attractive platform molecules derived from biomass and waste plastics. Thus, the selective electrooxidation of ethylene glycol (EGOR) into value-added chemicals (especially glycolic acid (GA)) can promote its recycling and upgrading. However, the understanding of the EG-to-GA process on Pt-group metal (PGM) electrodes is far limited now. It has been shown that the Pt and Pd electrodes could show considerable EGOR activity but not Rh and Ir electrodes. Meanwhile, EGOR mainly produces the glycolate, oxalate, and formate on Pt and Pd electrodes, whereas it can obtain minute amounts of glycolate and oxalate on Rh and Ir electrodes. Impressively, the selectivity of glycolate on Pt and Pd electrodes can be over 85% (apparent Faradaic efficiency) in alkaline media, although the stability should be further improved through interfacial tuning and/or engineering. This work might deepen the fundamental understanding of the EGOR process on the nature of PGM electrodes.

AB Introduction It remains unclear whether depressive symptoms are associated with increased all-cause mortality and to what extent depressive symptoms are associated with chronic disease and all-cause mortality. The study aims to explore the relationship between depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality, and how depressive symptoms may, in turn, affect all-cause mortality among Chinese middle-aged and older people through chronic diseases.Methods Data were collected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). This cohort study involved 13,855 individuals from Wave 1 (2011) to Wave 6 (2020) of the CHARLS, which is a nationally representative survey that collects information from Chinese residents ages 45 and older to explore intrinsic mechanisms between depressive symptoms and all-cause mortality. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) was validated through the CHARLS. Covariates included socioeconomic variables, living habits, and self-reported history of chronic diseases. Kaplan-Meier curves depicted mortality rates by depressive symptom levels, with Cox proportional hazards regression models estimating the hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality.Results Out of the total 13,855 participants included, the median (Q1, Q3) age was 58.00 (51.00, 63.00) years. Adjusted for all covariates, middle-aged and older adults with depressive symptoms had a higher all-cause mortality rate (HR = 1.20 [95% CI, 1.09-1.33]). An increased rate was observed for 55-64 years old (HR = 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03-1.47]) and more than 65 years old (HR = 1.32 [95% CI, 1.18-1.49]), agricultural Hukou (HR = 1.44, [95% CI, 1.30-1.59]), and nonagricultural workload (HR = 1.81 [95% CI, 1.61-2.03]). Depressive symptoms increased the risks of all-cause mortality among patients with hypertension (HR = 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]), diabetes (HR = 1.41[95% CI, 1.02-1.95]), and arthritis (HR = 1.29 [95% CI, 1.09-1.51]).Conclusion Depressive symptoms raise all-cause mortality risk, particularly in those aged 55 and above, rural household registration (agricultural Hukou), nonagricultural workers, and middle-aged and older people with hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis. Our findings through the longitudinal data collected in this study offer valuable insights for interventions targeting depression, such as early detection, integrated chronic disease care management, and healthy lifestyles; and community support for depressive symptoms may help to reduce mortality in middle-aged and older people.

AB The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria along with their resilient biofilms necessitates the development of creative antimicrobial remedies. We designed versatile fluorinated polymer micelles with surface-chargeswitchable properties, demonstrating enhanced efficacy against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) in planktonic and biofilm states. Polymethacrylate diblock copolymers with pendant fluorocarbon chains and carboxyl betaine groups were prepared using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. Amphiphilic fluorinated copolymers self-assembled into micelles, encapsulating ciprofloxacin in their cores (CIP@FCBMs) for antibacterial and antibiofilm applications. As a control, fluorine-free copolymer micelles loaded with ciprofloxacin (CIP@BCBMs) were prepared. Although both CIP@FCBMs and CIP@BCBMs exhibited pH-responsive surface charges and lipase-triggered drug release, CIP@FCBMs exhibited powerful antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities in vitro and in vivo, attributed to superior serum stability, higher drug loading, enhanced fluorination-facilitated cellular uptake, and lipase-triggered drug release. Collectively, reversing surface charge, on-demand antibiotic release, and fluorination-mediated nanoparticles hold promise for treating bacterial infections and biofilms.

AB Extensive application of lead (Pb) brought about environmental pollution and toxic reactions of organisms. Selenium (Se) has the effect of antagonizing Pb poisoning in humans and animals. However, it is still unclear how Pb causes brainstem toxicity. In the present study, we wanted to investigate whether Se can alleviate Pb toxicity in chicken brainstems by reducing apoptosis. One hundred and eighty chickens were randomly divided into four groups, namely the control group, the Se group, the Pb group, and the Se/Pb group. Morphological examination, ultrastructural observation, relative mRNA expressions of genes on heat shock proteins (HSPs); selenoproteins; inflammatory cytokines; and apoptosis-related factors were investigated. The results showed that Pb exposure led to tissue damage and apoptosis in chicken brainstems. Furthermore, an atypical expression of HSPs (HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90); selenoprotein family glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1, GPx2, GPx3, and GPx4), thioredoxin reductases (Txnrd) (Txnrd1, Txnrd2, and Txnrd3), dio selenoprotein famliy (diodothyronine deiodinases (Dio)1, Dio2, and Dio3), as well as other selenoproteins (selenoprotein (Sel)T, SelK, SelS, SelH, SelM, SelU, SelI, SelO, Selpb, selenoprotein n1 (Sepn1), Sepp1, Sepx1, Sepw1, 15-kDa selenoprotein (Sep15), and selenophosphate synthetases 2 (SPS2)); inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin 2 (IL -2), IL -4, IL -6, IL-12 beta, IL -17, and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)); and apoptosis-related genes (B -cell lymphoma -2 (Bcl-2), tumor protein 53 (p53), Bcl-2 Associated X (Bax), Cytochrome c (Cyt c), and Caspase-3) were identified. An inflammatory reaction and apoptosis were induced in chicken brainstems after exposure to Pb. Se alleviated the abnormal expression of HSPs, selenoproteins, inflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis in brainstem tissues of chickens treated with Pb. The results indicated that HSPs, selenoproteins, inflammatory, and apoptosis were involved in Se -resisted Pb poisoning. Overall, Se had resistance effect against Pb poisoning, and can be act as an antidote for Pb poisoning in animals.

AB The present study aimed to shed light on the effects of altitudes and three cooking methods (boiling, steaming, and roasting) on the physicochemical quality, volatile profile, and sensorial characteristics of yak meat. Composite meat samples were prepared to represent each cooking method and altitude level from the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle of nine yaks. The techniques employed were gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electronic nose (E-nose) along with chemometrics analysis to study the changes occurring in yak volatile profile, and TBARS measurement in lipid oxidation during cooking. Among the cooking methods, boiling and steaming exhibited higher protein and fat content while lower volatile compound contents. Additionally, roasted yak meat received the highest sensory scores, along with decreased L*-values, while elevated a*- and b*-values, and tenderness. A total of 138 volatile compounds were detected, and among them, 36 odorants were identified as odor-active compounds in cooked yak meat. It is evidenced that low-altitude yak presented more complex and richer flavor profiles than high-altitude ones. Moreover, yak meat from low- and high-altitude was classified into two groups by an electronic nose (E-nose) owing to distinct flavor characteristics. Overall, roasted yak meat originating from low altitudes tends to be more popular from a sensory perspective.

AB Measuring differences between an individual's age and biological age with biological information from the brain have the potential to provide biomarkers of clinically relevant neurological syndromes that arise later in human life. To explore the effect of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features on the prediction of brain age, we investigated how multimodal brain imaging data improved age prediction from more imaging features of structural or functional MRI data by using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and longevity data sets (age 6-85 years). First, we found that the age-predicted values for each of these ten features ranged from high to low: cortical thickness (R = 0.866, MAE = 7.904), all seven MRI features (R = 0.8594, MAE = 8.24), four features in structural MRI (R = 0.8591, MAE = 8.24), fALFF (R = 0.853, MAE = 8.1918), gray matter volume (R = 0.8324, MAE = 8.931), three rs-fMRI feature (R = 0.7959, MAE = 9.744), mean curvature (R = 0.7784, MAE = 10.232), ReHo (R = 0.7833, MAE = 10.122), ALFF (R = 0.7517, MAE = 10.844), and surface area (R = 0.719, MAE = 11.33). In addition, the significance of the volume and size of brain MRI data in predicting age was also studied. Second, our results suggest that all multimodal imaging features, except cortical thickness, improve brain-based age prediction. Third, we found that the left hemisphere contributed more to the age prediction, that is, the left hemisphere showed a greater weight in the age prediction than the right hemisphere. Finally, we found a nonlinear relationship between the predicted age and the amount of MRI data. Combined with multimodal and lifespan brain data, our approach provides a new perspective for chronological age prediction and contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between brain disorders and aging.

AB The application of protein-stabilized Pickering emulsions can be improved by coating polysaccharides. This work investigated the effect of different charged polysaccharides including neutral inulin, anionic xanthan gum (XG), and cationic chitosan on the functional properties of Pickering emulsions stabilized by gelatin/catechin nanoparticles (GC). The addition of polysaccharides was found to enhance the ordered structure of protein at the oilwater interfaces, decrease the backscattering of the emulsions, inhibit the flow rate of the droplets by increasing viscosity. The creaming rates of emulsions with XG, chitosan and inulin were decreased to 2.18 & PLUSMN; 0.04 x 102 , 1.55 & PLUSMN; 0.05 x 102 and 5.27 & PLUSMN; 0.18 x 102 mm/h, respectively, compared with that of GC emulsion without polysaccharides (6.08 & PLUSMN; 0.22 x 102 mm/h). Noteworthy, the emulsions composed of XG and chitosan exhibited greatly the physical stability, due to strong electrostatic repulsion and electrostatic deposition, respectively. In vitro digestion of emulsions showed that the lipid digestibility was reduced from 82.6% & PLUSMN; 0.21% to 72.8% & PLUSMN; 0.64%, 55.8% & PLUSMN; 0.93%, and 58.3% & PLUSMN; 0.41% in the presence of inulin, XG, and chitosan, respectively. These findings reveal a possible method for protein-stabilized Pickering emulsions to delivering bioactive compounds and designing lipid digestion inhibition systems.

AB The effects of dietary supplementation of essential oil on growth performance, carcass yield, meat quality, serum antioxidant capacity, and intestinal tight junctions of broilers with or without Eimeria challenge were investigated. A total of 576 one-day-old male broilers were randomly separated into 8 treatments (6 replication floor-pens per treatment, 12 broilers per pen) in a 4 & POUND; 2 factorial design. The 4 diets consisted of 1) a corn and soybean meal basal diet, 2) an anticoccidial diet (60 g nicarbazin and 60 g narasin per ton of feed), 3) an oregano oil diet (500 ppm oregano oil), and 4) a clove oil diet (500 ppm clove oil). On d 10, half chicks were challenged with 1 & POUND; 104 sporulated oocysts of E. tenella, E. acervulina, and E. maxima per chick, whereas the others were inoculated with an equal amount of dilution (0.5 mL). The Eimeria challenge induced a higher fecal oocyst output on d 18, a lower duodenum Occludin expression level on d 28, a lower serum catalase level, and a higher cook loss and protein loss in thigh muscle on d 42. The anticoccidial diet lowered fecal Eimeria output and increased d 1 to 42 BW gain as compared to the control diet. The clove oil treatment enhanced duodenum ZO-1 expression level in nonchallenged birds, increased BW gain from d 1 to 14 and breast yield on d 42. The oregano oil treatment enhanced ZO-1 expression of challenged birds, reduced feed intake from 15 to 28 d, and helped broilers gain more tender meat. For those Eimeria-challenged broilers, both clove and oregano oil treatments recovered drip loss in breast muscle. Our results suggested that Eimeria challenge in broiler early age could interrupt later serum antioxidant capacity and damage meat quality. The dietary supplementation of clove or oregano essential oils could improve broiler growth performance and partially relieve the coccidial damage in gut integrity and meat quality.

AB The appearance of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the formation of bacterial biofilms have necessitated the development of alternative antimicrobial therapeutics. Antibiotics conjugated with or embedded in nano-drug carriers show a great potential and advantage over free drugs, but the mass proportion of carriers generally exceeds 90% of the nano -drug, resulting in low drug loading and limited therapeutic output. Herein, we fabricated a nanocarrier using antibiotics as the building blocks, minimizing the use of carrier materials, significantly increasing the drug loading content and treatment effect. Firstly, we conjugated betaine carboxylate with ciprofloxacin (CIP) through an ester bond to form the amphiphilic conjugate (CIP-CB), which self-assembled into micelles (CIP-CBMs) in aqueous solutions, with a CIP loading content as high as 65.4% and pH-induced surface charge reversal properties. Secondly, a model photosensitizer (5, 10, 15, 20-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP)) was encapsulated in CIP-CBMs, generating infection-targeted photodynamic/antibiotic combined nanomedicines (denoted as TPP@CIP-CBMs). Upon accumulation at infection sites or in deep bacterial biofilms, the ester bond between the betaine carboxylate and CIP is cleaved to release free TPP and CIP, leading to a synergetic antibacterial and antibiofilm activity in vitro and in vivo .(c) 2023 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

AB A novel K-loaded biochar as controlled-release K fertilizer was prepared through K assisted pyrolysis of distillers' grains (DGs, typical solid-byproducts of Chinese Baijiu) under different atmospheres (N-2 and CO2) and temperatures (400 and 800 degrees C). The fabricated DGs-based biochar exhibited high K loading (200.20-232.33 mg/g), and the release kinet-ics and column leaching experiments suggested that K-loaded biochar exhibited excellent controlled release perfor-mance in a long term. Compared with other biochar, the K-loaded biochar prepared at CO2 and 400 degrees C has lower cumulative release ratio of 82.35 %, and could retain the durative K release at similar to 0.5 % for 25 d. The release kinetics suggested that the K release behavior was dominated by dissolution, electrostatic attraction, adsorption, confinement effect, and chemical interaction. Furthermore, pot experiments revealed that K-loaded biochar could promote the growth of Komatsuna, in which the fresh weight and chlorophyll relative content of Komatsuna cultivated with biochar prepared at CO2 and 400 degrees C reached 0.146 g and 41.95 after 25 d growth, respectively. The above results suggested that the K-loaded biochar exhibited excellent utilization potential as a controlled-release K fertilizer, facilitating the sustainable development and resource valorization of Baijiu industry.

AB Anthropogenic warming and land-use change are expected to accelerate global soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and change plant species composition and richness. However, how changes in plant composition and species richness mediate SOC responses to climate warming and land-use change remains poorly understood. Using data from a 7-year warming and clipping field experiment in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we examined the direct effects of warming and clipping on SOC storage versus their indirect effects mediated by plant functional type and species richness. We found that warming significantly increased SOC storage by 8.1% and clipping decreased it by 6.4%, which was closely correlated with the corresponding response of below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP). We also found a negative correlation between SOC storage and species richness, which was ascribed to the increased BNPP via enhancing the dominance of grasses and decreasing species richness under warming. The lower SOC storage under clipping was caused by the clipping-induced decrease in BNPP via weakening the dominance of grasses and increasing species richness. Our findings highlight that the SOC storage in this alpine meadow under climate warming and clipping was primarily governed by BNPP changes, which was mediated by changes in the dominance of grasses and species richness. Overall, our study demonstrates that shifting to the dominance of grasses and changing species richness would benefit soil C sequestration under climate warming, but this positive effect would be dampened by grazing or hay harvest.

AB The impacts of natural antioxidants, including ferulic acid, diallyl sulfide, alpha-tocopherol, and rutin, at a level of 0.2 g/kg on lipid and protein oxidation of minced yak meat in a hydroxyl-radical-generating system were investigated, and the effectiveness was compared with synthetic antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT). The exposure of yak meat to oxidative stress from 12 h to 24 h elevated lipid and protein oxidation. Treatments with antioxidants resulted in significantly lower peroxides, conjugated dienes, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and were also effective in retarding the formation of carbonyl groups, reducing the loss of sulfhydryl groups and protecting alpha-helix contents, of which ferulic acid and rutin were the most effective. Myosin heavy chain underwent lower degradation in the samples treated with ferulic acid or rutin compared with the oxidized control and other antioxidant treatments, while that of the BHT treatment showed a similar intensity with oxidized control at 24 h of oxidation. The physical stability of myofibrillar proteins in samples with antioxidants from high to low was rutin, ferulic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and BHT similar to diallyl sulfide. These results indicate that rutin and ferulic acid may be promising antioxidants in inhibiting the oxidative reactions during the processing of yak meat.

AB Lager beer with high content of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) and strong antioxidant activity was produced by supplementing six jujube cultivars (Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Hetian, Muzao, Huizao, Goutou, Jinsixiaozao, and Banzao) as adjuncts. Jujube supplementation significantly increased total phenolic and flavonoids contents of final beers, and therefore improved antioxidant activities based on DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods, especially for Banzao supplementation, exhibiting the highest antioxidant activities, increasing by 31.00%, 20.81% and 43.66%, respectively, which were positively correlated with protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid and rutin levels. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that jujube supplementation significantly influenced flavor formation in final beers. There were 17 new volatile compounds formation after jujube supplementation, including one alcohol, 11 esters, two acids and three aldehydes, suggesting the improved complexity of beer flavor. In addition, high contents of c-AMP ranging from 4.02 to 15.14 mu g/mL were observed in final beers fermented by jujube supplementation, endowing beer with a new health function.

AB Hierarchical porous carbon-based electrodes, benefiting from their facilitated ion diffusion and electron con-duction, have demonstrated enormous potential in supercapacitors. The preparation of hierarchical carbons with uniformity and appropriate porosity, however, still remains a grand challenge, which hinders their widespread applications. Herein, a hierarchical porous polyimide-derived carbon electrode (CPC-Fe/Zn) has been fabricated by employing bimetallic salts (Fe/Zn) as precursor and template to activate the cellulose/polyimide (PI) carbon (CPC). Originating from suitable distribution of mesopores and micropores, the obtained CPC-Fe/Zn delivers a high specific capacitance of 420 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor device assembled with CPC-Fe/Zn exhibits delivers an energy density of 35.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 800 W/kg. Even at a larger current density of 20 A/g, the specific capacitance retention of such device still remains 92.5 % after 10,000 cycles, showing the rate performance and stability. This work has proposed a bimetallic salts template-assisted strategy to precisely modulate of the pore structure of carbon electrodes, which provides a promising platform to design superior electrodes for various electrochemical systems.

AB Tourist subjectivities have an important effect on behavioral intentions. Under the background of normalization, tourism decision-making manifests primarily in tourists' individual preferences, which has led much research to ignore the importance of other subjective factors, as well as objective environmental factors. In the COVID-19 era, tourism behavior's social attributes have become more prominent; the effect of important others or organizations' attitudes toward tourism behavior, as well as personal knowledge, ability, and experience in preventing and controlling tourism risks, are evident. This study integrates knowledge-attitude-behavior (KAB), Theory of Perceived Risk (TPR), Social Identity Theory (SIT), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), along with a comprehensive framework method, to construct an integrated model exploring the impact of knowledge, identity, and perceived risk on travel intention, to analyze its pathways and effects, to resolve the issue of mechanism, to analyze the moderating effect of past travel experience, and to answer the problem of boundary conditions. It finds that knowledge, perceived risk, and identity have a significant positive impact on travel intention; travel attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control mediate the influence of knowledge, perceived risk, and identity on travel intention; these mechanism pathways do not always exist. The positive adjustment of past travel experiences shows that repeat visitors have a greater impact than newcomers and potential tourists.

AB Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) were conjugated by covalent bonds to form EGCG-beta Lg conjugates. This conjugation causes structural and bioactivity changes in beta Lg, which in turn can be used as a possible approach for desensitization to allergens. In this study, the desensitization mechanism was investigated by monitoring beta Lg secondary structure and immunoglobulin E (IgE) combining capacity changes on the basis of the conjugation mechanism. Furthermore, the desensitization efficiency in vivo was evaluated through animal experiments. The results show that temperature influenced the conjugation by decreasing the binding affinities (K-a) and binding numbers (n) of EGCG. The conjugation of EGCG decreased beta Lg's IgE combining capacity by decreasing the beta-sheet component and imparted antioxidant properties by the introduction of hydroxyl groups. In addition, animal experiment results indicated that beta Lg induced significant changes in the levels of IgE and inflammatory cytokines, and the relative abundance of small intestinal flora, linked to the inflammatory lesions and anaphylaxis symptoms. EGCG-beta Lg conjugates can suppress the allergic response, attenuating serum IgE and relieving the anaphylaxis symptoms.

AB Nitric oxide (NO) may play a critical role in the regulation of various physiological and pathophysiological processes due to its effect on the apoptosis pathway. However, few reports have studied the effects of NO on apoptosis and yak meat tenderization. The present study was conducted to explore the molecular mechanisms of Ca2+-independent inducible NO synthase isozyme (iNOS)-derived NO in mitochondrial apoptosis and meat tenderization during postmortem aging. Results indicated that the aminoguanidi hydrochloride (AH) significantly reduced iNOS activities and NO production. Moreover, the inhibitory property of iNOS-derived NO dramatically decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress degree, which further reduced the production of mitochondrial Ca2+ and ATP. The inhibitory property of iNOS-derived NO also influenced the Bcl-2 family members, mitochondrial apoptotic cascade reaction, and meat tenderization by protecting against the degradation of myofibrils and the damage of mitochondrial microstructure. These results demonstrated that the iNOS-derived NO possessed a significant role in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and yak meat tenderization during aging.

AB The tool box of site-specific cleavage for nucleic acid has been an increasingly attractive subject. Especially, the recent emergence of the orthogonally activatable DNA device is closely related to the site-specific scission. However, most of these cleavage strategies are based on exogenous assistance, such as laser irradiation. Endogenous strategies are highly desirable for the orthogonally regulatable DNA machine to explore the crucial intracellular biological process and cell signal network. Here, we found that the accurate site-specific cleavage reaction of phosphorothioate (PT) modified DNA by using myeloperoxidase (MPO). A scissors-like mechanism by which MPO breaks PT modification through chloride oxidation has been revealed. Furthermore, we have successfully applied the scissors to activate PT-modified hairpin-DNA machines to produce horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mimicking DNAzyme or initiate hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification. Since MPO plays an important role in the pathway related to oxidative stress in cells, through the HCR amplification activated by this tool box, the oxidative stress in living cells has been robustly imaged. This work proposes an accurate and endogenous site-specific cleavage tool for the research of biostimuli and the construction of DNA molecular devices.

AB Making use of the natural plant extract as assistant matrix or photocatalyst provides an efficient strategy to break the limitation of traditional photochemical vapor generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry in efficiency, sensitivity, and biocompatibility. In this work, ivy extract-assisted photochemical vapor generation was proposed for the determination of trace mercury in natural water by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The influencing factors such as irradiation time, irradiation wavelength and concentration of extract were systematically studied. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the limit of detection for total mercury was 0.03 ng mL(-1) which is better than the ethanol- assisted photochemical vapor generation system. This method is green and sensitive, reduces the biological toxicity of photocatalytic materials and secondary pollution in the reduction process, and provides experimental basis for expanding the photochemical vapor generation system.

AB The Confinement effect is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of catalysts during various reactions. We developed a strategy to encapsulating Palladium nanoparticles with a dopamine-derived N-doped multilayer carbon shell to catalyze the Heck reaction between iodobenzene and carbon-carbon double-bond compounds (styrene and methyl acrylate). The catalytic performances of Pd nanoparticles encapsulated within a N-doped carbon layer (Pd@N-C) and those attached to the external surface of such a layer (Pd/N-C) were evaluated and compared. Pd@N-C exhibited a lower reaction activation energy (78 kJ/mol) than that of Pd/N-C (106 kJ/mol). Thus, the activity of Pd@N-C during the Heck reaction between iodobenzene and methyl acrylate was approximately 20 times higher than that of Pd/N-C-200. The results of thermal filtration and recycling tests indicated that Pd@N-C showed a lower degree of leaching than that of Pd/N-C-200 owing to the spatial restriction effect of the cavity in the case of the former. Hence, the superior catalytic performance of Pd@N-C can be ascribed to the confinement of the Pd nanoparticles within the N-doped carbon layer. Finally, we used these catalysts to synthesize a range of para-substituted iodobenzene derivatives, thus demonstrating the potential of Pd-encapsulating catalysts for use in the Heck reaction on the technical scale.

AB The transition-metal free amination of 1,4-naphthoquinone and related 3-indolylnaphthoquinones with amines, such as various (hetero)aromatic amine and aliphatic amine via t-BuOK-mediated oxidative coupling at room temperature has been developed. This reaction provides efficient access to the biologically important and synthetically useful 2-amino-1,4-naphthoquinones and 2-amino-3-indolylnaphthoquinones with good yields under mild conditions. The present protocol is simple, practical and shows good functional group tolerance. In addition, the obtained 2-amino-3-indolylnaphthoquinones were further transformed to synthesize polycyclic N-heterocycles.

AB Surfactants based on dynamic covalent bonds have attracted significant interest over the past few decades due to the coexistence of covalent and non-covalent bonds. However, studies on the fundamental properties of their precursors are rare. Herein, we synthesized a series of formyl-containing cationic surfactants (N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-(4-formyl-phenoxy)ethyl) ammonium bromides) bearing different hydrophobic chains, which can form dynamic imine bonds. The adsorption, micellization and antimicrobial activity were systematically investigated using surface tension, fluorescence, electrical conductivity, and ITC techniques. The results showed that the insertion of the 2-(4-formyl-phenoxy)ethyl group (equivalent to similar to 7 methylene groups) endows the surfactant with an asymmetrical double-chain structure, enhancing the hydrophobic interaction. Asa result, the (Titical micelle concentration (cmc) and contribution per methylene group to the standard Gibbs free energy of micellization (Delta G(m)(0)) were significantly decreased, compared to conventional single surfactant. Upon increasing the hydrophobic chain length, the cmc, the negative logarithm of the surfactant concentration in the bulk phase required to produce a 20 mN.m(-1) reduction in the surface tension of the solvent (pC(20)) and maximum surface excess amount of the adsorbed surfactant (Gamma(max)) all decreased accompanied by an increase in the minimum molecular occupation area (A(m)(in)), while the Delta G(m)(0), and standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption (Delta G(ads)(0)) become more negative and thus more favorable for the formation of micelles and the adsorption film. Moreover, micellization changed from being entropy-driven to enthalpy-driven and is more sensitive toward NaCI than urea. In addition, the current formyl-containing cationic surfactants exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, especially the surfactant with a hydrophobic chain containing similar to 20 atoms. Such a study will be favorable for the design of new dynamic covalent surfactants and an understanding of the change in their aggregation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new species of the xenodermatid snake genus Achalinus Peters, 1869 is described from Yunnan Province, Southwest China, based on a single male specimen. The new species is assigned to the genus Achalinus on the basis of absence of preocular and postocular, subcaudals arranged in single row, and results of phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA CO1 sequence data. Achalinus pingbianensis sp. nov. differs from its congeners by the combination of following morphological characters: absence of a loreal, internasals subequal to that between prefrontals and dorsal scales strongly keeled. 23 rows throughout. Currently, 13 species are in the genus Achalinus, further taxonomical and phylogenetic studies based on more extensive samples and more markers will help understand the cryptic diversity and clarify their interspecific relationships.

AB The construction of heterostructured photocatalyst with an appropriate energy band structure will help realize highly efficient photo-excited charge separation. In this study, ternary CuO/CeO2/ZnO nano-particle (NP) composites were synthesized by a facile two-step sol-gel method, which exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance for various organic pollutants under UV and visible light excitation. The photo-responses to both UV and visible light, as well as the visible light absorption and utilization rates of ZnO are found to be synergistically intensified by CeO2 and CuO co-coupling. The first-order kinetic constants (K) of 3%CuO/CeO2/ZnO for methylene blue (MB) degradation are similar to 3.9, similar to 4.1 and similar to 4.8 times higher than ZnO under UV light, visible light and simulated sunlight illumination, respectively. The roles of CuO and CeO2 in optical properties and photo-degradation under UV and visible light were explored. Besides, the photogenic holes (h(+)) of ZnO, CeO2, and the produced hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) are proved to be the main active species under UV light. Dissimilarly, under visible light, the superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) formed by the reactions between oxygen molecules and the photo-generated electrons (e(-)) of CuO moving towards the catalysts surface are also found to be important for promoting dye decomposition. The improved photo-responses, the well-matched band structure that facilitates charge transfer processes, and the highly efficient utilization of the photo-excited carriers of the ternary nano-heterostructure are suggested to be the key factors for the remarkable enhancement of photocatalytic performance of ZnO nano-photocatalyst. This work offers a low-cost strategy to acquire highly active UV and visible light-driven photocatalyst.

AB The adaptation and diversity of animals to the extreme environments of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are typical materials to study adaptive evolution. The recently discovered Jinchuan yak population has many individuals with multiple ribs. However, little is known about this yak's origin, evolution, and the genetic mechanisms that formed its unique multirib trait. Here, we report a valuable population genome resource of the Jinchuan yak by resequencing the whole genome of 150 individuals. Population genetic polymorphism and structure analysis reveal that Jinchuan yak can be differentiated as a unique and original yak population among the domestic yak. Combined with geological change, the Jinchuan yak's evolutionary origin is speculated to be about 6290 years ago, which may be related to the unique geographical environment of the eastern edge of the QTP during this period. Compared with other domestic yaks, this new population has 280 positively selected genes. The genes related to skeletal function hold a considerable and remarkable proportion, suggesting that the specific skeletal characteristics have been enhanced in the adaptive evolution of Jinchuan yak in the extreme plateau environment. The genome-wide association study has revealed thatTUBA8andTUBA4A, the genes that regulate the cytoskeleton, are potential genes associated with the multirib trait. Our findings provide a basis to further understand the generation mechanism of the adaptive evolution of this new population in high-altitude extreme environments and the multivertebrate trait of domestic animals.

AB Ammonia (NH3), an environmental pollutant with a pungent odor, is not only an important volatile in fertilizer production and ranching, but also main basic component of haze. In present study, we found that ultrastructural changes and 3167 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) using proteomics analysis in the thymuses of chickens exposed to NH3 on day 42. Obtained DEPs were enriched using GO and KEGG; and 66 DEPs took part in immune function, metabolic process, and apoptosis in the thymuses of chickens treated with NH3. 9 genes of DEPs were validated using qRT-PCR, and mRNA expression of 2 immune-related genes (CTSG and NFATC2), 3 metabolic process-related genes (APOA1, GOT1, and GOLGA3), and 4 apoptosis-related genes (PIK3CD, CTSS, CAMP, and NSD2) were consistent with DEPs in chicken thymuses. Our results indicated that excess NH3 led to immunosuppression, metabolic disorder, and apoptosis in chicken thymuses. Present study gives a novel insight into the mechanism of NH3 toxicity and demonstrated that immune response, metabolism process, and apoptosis were important in the mechanism of NH3 toxicity of chicken exposure to high concentration of NH3.

AB Increasing photosynthetic ability as a whole is essential for acquiring higher crop yields. Nonleaf green organs (NLGOs) make important contributions to photosynthate formation, especially under stress conditions. However, there is little information on the pod wall in legume forage related to seed development and yield. This experiment is designed for alfalfa (Medicago sativa) under drought stress to explore the photosynthetic responses of pod walls after 5, 10, 15, and 20 days of pollination (DAP5, DAP10, DAP15, and DAP20) based on ultrastructural, physiological and proteomic analyses. Stomata were evidently observed on the outer epidermis of the pod wall. Chloroplasts had intact structures arranged alongside the cell wall, which on DAP5 were already capable of producing photosynthate. The pod wall at the late stage (DAP20) still had photosynthetic ability under well-watered (WW) treatments, while under water-stress (WS), the structure of the chloroplast membrane was damaged and the grana lamella of thylakoids were blurry. The chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b concentrations both decreased with the development of pod walls, and drought stress impeded the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. Although the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) decreased in the pod wall under drought stress, the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) increased higher than that of RuBisCo. The proteomic analysis showed that the absorption of light is limited due to the suppression of the synthesis of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins by drought stress. Moreover, proteins involved in photosystem I and photosystem II were downregulated under WW compared with WS. Although the expression of some proteins participating in the regeneration period of RuBisCo was suppressed in the pod wall subjected to drought stress, the synthesis of PEPC was induced. In addition, some proteins, which were involved in the reduction period of RuBisCo, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism, and related to resistance, including chitinase, heat shock protein 81-2 (Hsp81-2), and lipoxygenases (LOXs), were highly expressed for the protective response to drought stress. It could be suggested that the pod wall in alfalfa is capable of operating photosynthesis and reducing the photosynthetic loss from drought stress through the promotion of the C4 pathway, ATP synthesis, and resistance ability.

AB Today, graphene nanomaterials are produced on a large-scale and applied in various areas. The toxicity and hazards of graphene materials have aroused great concerns, in which the detection and quantification of graphene are essential for environmental risk evaluations. In this study, we developed a fast identification and quantification method for graphene oxide (GO) in aqueous environments using Raman spectroscopy. GO was chemically reduced by hydrazine hydrate to form partially reduced GO (PRGO), where the fluorescence from GO was largely reduced, and the Raman signals (G band and D band) were dominating. According to the Raman characteristics, GO was easily be distinguished from other carbon nanomaterials in aqueous environments, such as carbon nanotubes, fullerene and carbon nanoparticles. The GO concentration was quantified in the range of 0.001-0.6 mg/mL with good linearity. Using our technique, we did not find any GO in local water samples. The transport of GO dispersion in quartz sands was successfully quantified. Our results indicated that GO was conveniently quantified by Raman spectroscopy after partial reduction. The potential applications of our technique in the environmental risk evaluations of graphene materials are discussed further.

AB With the development of industrial Internet of Things technology, the relatively closed industrial control system has become more complex and open, and it is facing increasingly serious information security problems. Aiming at the security problems existing in the current intelligent manufacturing industrial Internet of Things, this paper proposes a credible overall architecture of the IoT industrial control system. By adding a trusted function module, the credibility level is evaluated and abnormal operations are monitored. The sensing environment for the Internet of Things is more complicated. This paper proposes a cluster-based routing method. While ensuring the trustworthiness and security of data routing, the routing protocol is maintained efficiently and reliably. A scenario of node cooperation is proposed for scenarios of a large number of malicious nodes. Abnormal attacks are suppressed by maintaining dynamic Bayesian balance between the attacker and the detection node. The simulation results show that the mechanism cooperation game can significantly improve the event detection success rate of abnormal detection nodes and greatly reduce the number of forged reports.

AB Introduction The herbs Notopterygium incisum (NI) and N. franchetii (NF) are referred to as "Qianghuo" in the Chinese Pharmacopeia and are popular for treatment of certain conditions, including headaches, rheumatoid arthritis and the common cold. Recently, several adulterations of NI and NF have been found in the Chinese herbal market. Objective The aim of this study was to rapidly identify the unique characteristic compounds of NI and NF, to discriminate Qianghuo from its adulterations. Methodology Twenty-four batches of NI and NF samples with different origins were collected and extracted with methanol. The extracts were analysed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were then used to distinguish between NI and NF and to identify their potential characteristic markers. Results Fifty compounds were identified or tentatively characterised according to the retention time, m/z value and MS/MS fragment analysis. Six compounds were selected as potential markers of NI and NF by PCA and OPLS-DA. They were successfully applied to authenticate 17 kinds of Chinese patent medicines containing Qianghuo. The markers could not be detected in three of the Chinese patent medicines, indicating that they were counterfeit products. Conclusion The UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS coupled with the multivariate analysis method could discriminate NI and NF from their adulterations. Moreover, the data clearly demonstrated significant differences in the chemical compositions of NI and NF. Further research is needed to examine the relationship between therapeutic efficacy and the chemical constituents of NI and NF.

AB In this study, hyperbranched polyether (HBP) with terminal hydroxyl was synthesized from tetrahydrofuran and glycidol by cationic open-loop polymerization and then modified by 2-phosphono-butane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid to introduce carboxyl and phosphorus to improve corrosion and scale inhibition. The structure of the products (HBPs) was determined by FTIR and H-1-NMR. The scale inhibition efficiency (E) of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate reached 99.74 and 97.10% at a concentration of 20mg/L. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine crystal type and morphology. The addition of scale inhibitors can inhibit the growth of the calcium scale crystal and destroy the crystal structure. The corrosion inhibition rate of HBPs can reach 72.98% when dosage was 150mg/L. Polarization curve showed that HBPs was a kind of mixed corrosion inhibitor. The adsorption of HBPs on the surface of carbon steel conformed to Langmuir adsorption, which formed physical adsorption film and inhibited the corrosion process. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

AB Notopterygium franchetii is a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as qianghuo. Its bioactive qualities are influenced by the post-harvest processing methods used (such as drying). However, changes in chemical components according to the drying method are unknown. Fresh roots and rhizomes of N. franchetii were subjected to seven drying methods. Chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with targeted and untargeted analyses were used to investigate relationships between drying methods and chemical concentrations. According to targeted evaluations of the six main bioactive constituents, their total contents decreased significantly in all drying methods. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the drying methods and total metabolome detected 30 chemical constituents, for which heap maps were obtained. Hot air drying was the best processing method, producing the least chemical changes at the lowest cost, while shade drying caused the greatest chemical changes. In conclusion, the wide range of chemical changes in N. franchetii caused by drying was investigated. Such changes potentially affect the quality of herbal medicines.

AB To evaluate the influence of transition metal substituents on the characteristics of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2, we investigated the geometrical and electronic properties of transition metal-substituted CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 by first-principles calculations. The results suggested that the substitution of Ti4+ at the five-fold coordinated (Ti-5c) sites by transition metals is energetically favored. The substituted interface has enhanced visible light sensitivity and photoelectrocatalytic activity by reducing the transition energies. The transition metal substitution can effectively tune the band gap of the interface, which significantly improves the photo-reactivity. The substituted systems are expected to be more efficient in separating the photo-generated electrons-holes and active in the visible spectrum.

AB A fast and simple method using co-grinding with Fe powder followed by heat treatment is developed to regulate surface oxygen vacancy content of ZnO nanoparticles. The moderately increased surface oxygen vacancy is conducive to shortening the adsorption and desorption times of NO2 molecules, arising from the enhanced O-2 adsorption. Therefore, the response and recovery speeds of ZnO nanoparticle-based sensor under UV irradiation were significantly promoted. Our findings not only offer a feasible strategy to modulate surface oxygen vacancy content of nanostructured oxides, but also provide a novel approach to improve the response and recovery speeds of light-activated NO2 sensor.

AB Schizothorax prenanti is a cold-water fish species with great economic importance in aquaculture in Western China, and the underlying mechanisms of muscle development and growth in S. prenanti remain to be elucidated. In this study, deep RNA sequencing was performed to provide an in-depth view of the transcriptome of skeletal muscle of S. prenanti with the specific objective to identify expressed genes in the skeletal muscle of S. prenanti at 30 days post-hatching (S01), 1 year (S02), and 3 years (S03). De novo assembly of high-quality reads generated 132,784 transcripts with an average length of 1282 bp and 67,596 unigenes with an average length of 1559 bp. 2445 unigenes were differentially expressed with 1483 up-regulated and 962 down-regulated in the skeletal muscle of S. prenanti at S01 and S02 stages, and 1936 unigenes were significantly impacted at S02 and S03 stages with 1153 increased and 783 decreased. GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes are involved in various biological processes with dominance by cell & cell part, binding & catalytic activity, and cellular process & metabolic process. KEGG enrichment suggested that there are considerable differences in the physiological processes at different stages of muscle development and growth of S. prenanti. PPAR signaling pathway, cardiac muscle contraction, fatty acid metabolism, tight junction, and focal adhesion were the top pathways enriched in comparison between S01 and S02 stages. Whereas significant enrichment of the TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and propanoate metabolism pathway was found in differentially expressed genes identified between S02 and S03 stages. This study provides not only an overall insight into the global gene expression landscape in the skeletal muscle of S. prenatal, but also candidate genes or markers that can be used for further investigations of the underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle development and growth of S. prenanti.

AB Herein, we report a simple and facile strategy to prepare one kind of smart chiral magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PDA@PNG-CD) with high enantioselectivity via combining mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) chemistry with surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization for effective enantioseparation of tryptophan enantiomers (dl-Trp). The PDA thin layer plays a pivotal role in fabricating high-density poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate)--cyclodextrin (PNG-CD) smart polymer brushes onto the Fe3O4 NPs. The grafted PNG-CD plays a significant role in greatly boosting the enantioselectivity of the Fe3O4@PDA@PNG-CD, which is composed of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PNG) copolymer chains with numerous appended -cyclodextrin (-CD) units. The -CD units serve as chiral selectors capable of selectively recognizing and binding l-tryptophan (l-Trp) into their cavities by forming stable host-guest inclusion complexes of -CD/l-Trp, and the PNIPAM chains act as microenvironmental adjustors for the inclusion constants of -CD/l-Trp complexes. Operating temperature and initial concentrations of dl-Trp are two important factors that significantly affect the separation efficiency of dl-Trp and the enantioselectivity of the Fe3O4@PDA@PNG-CD. Furthermore, the Fe3O4@PDA@PNG-CD also demonstrates satisfactory recycling and excellent magnetic separability from enantiomeric solution. Such smart chiral magnetic NPs with high enantioselectivity developed in this study show great potentials in direct enantioseparation of various chiral compounds.

AB Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV) causes congenital tremor (CT) in piglets and has a wide geographical distribution. In this study, we evaluated APPV prevalence using 165 piglet sera from southwest China. Viral RNA was detectable by qRT-PCR in 43.6 % (17/39, 95 % CI 27.8-60.4%) of piglets with CT, while viral RNA was not detected in the sera of any healthy piglets. The seven complete APPV genomes were obtained from distinct farms and were 11 269-11 459 nucleotides in length. The genomes of the seven strains shared 82.8-98 % identity with the APPV reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes as well as E2 and Nrpo sequences revealed that the seven APPVs clustered into two groups: four strains belonged to genogroups A and D and three strains belonged to a novel APPV genotype, tentatively called genogroup E. This study provides important insights into the epidemiological features and genetic diversity of APPV.

AB This research assessed the gene expression patterns related to the synthesis of milk in yak, which is charac-terized by high fat and protein content but low yield. The yak (Bos grunniens) is one of the most crucial domestic animals in Tibetan life; however, the genetic and molecular factors underlying yak milk protein synthesis remain understudied. Yak mammary biopsies harvested during late-pregnancy (d - 15) through the end of subsequent lactation (d 1, 15, 30, 60, 180, and 240) were used to evaluate gene expression via real-time quantitative PCR. The expression pattern of 41 genes encompassing multiple pathways integral to milk protein synthesis including insulin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, Jak2-Stat5 signaling, and the expression of glucose and AA transporters was evaluated. Our results confirmed that most upregulated genes increased from d - 15 and peaked at d 30 or 60 and then remained relatively highly expressed. Specifically, there was an increased expression of mTOR-related amino acid transporters (SLC1A5, SLC7A5, and SLC36A1), glucose transporters (SLC2A1, SLC2A3, and SLC2A8), Jak2-Stat5 path- way (ELF5), and insulin signaling pathway components (IRS1, PDPK1, and AKT1). For activation of proteins synthesis, MTOR was significantly increased only at d 1. Among inhibitors of mTOR signaling, TSC1 and PRKAA2 were significantly upregulated during lactation. The RPL23 was downregulated among ribosomal components. In conclusion, a critical role for AA and glucose transporters and insulin signaling through mTOR for regulation of yak milk protein synthesis was revealed in this study of the yak mammary gland.

AB Electric forklifts, dominantly powered by lead acid batteries, are widely used for material handling in factories, warehouses, and docks. The long charging time and short working time characteristics of the lead acid battery module results in the necessity of several battery modules to support one forklift. Compared with the cost and time consuming lead acid battery charging system, a fuel cell/battery hybrid power module could be more convenient for a forklift with fast hydrogen refueling and long working time. In this paper, based on the characteristics of a fuel cell and a battery, a prototype hybrid forklift with a fuel cell/battery hybrid power system is constructed, and its hardware and software are designed in detail. According to the power demand of driver cycles and the state of charge (SOC) of battery, an energy management strategy based on load current following for the hybrid forklift is proposed to improve system energy efficiency and dynamic response performance. The proposed energy management strategy will fulfill the power requirements under typical driving cycles, achieve reasonable power distribution between the fuel cell and battery and, thus, prolong its continuous working time. The proposed energy management strategy is implemented in the hybrid forklift prototype and its effectiveness is tested under different operating conditions. The results show that the forklift with the proposed hybrid powered strategy has good performance with different loads, both lifting and moving, in a smooth and steady way, and the output of the fuel cell meets the requirements of its output characteristics, its SOC of battery remaining at a reasonable level.

AB Anthocyanins from red cabbage are of great importance for their applications in the food industry as natural colorants and their beneficial effects on human wellness as natural antioxidants. This study aimed to develop an effective method for the isolation of anthocyanins with the help of a combination of alternate recycling and direct recycling preparative liquid chromatography. Ten major components of anthocyanins from red cabbage were isolated and their structures were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Meanwhile, the stability of the isolated anthocyanins under various light conditions was also investigated so as to provide data for their storage. In sum, the results showed that twin column recycling preparative chromatography is an effective method for the isolation of anthocyanin monomers with similar structures. Besides, the stability of various anthocyanins from red cabbage was related to the number of acylated groups and mainly affected by illumination.

AB Fullerenes are widely produced and applied carbon nanomaterials that require a thorough investigation into their environmental hazards and risks. In this study, we compared the toxicity of pristine fullerene (C-60) and carboxylated fullerene (C-60-COOH) to white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The influence of fullerene on the weight increase, fibrous structure, ultrastructure, enzyme activity, and decomposition capability of P. chrysosporium was investigated to reflect the potential toxicity of fullerene. C-60 did not change the fresh and dry weights of P. chrysosporium but C-60-COOH inhibited the weight gain at high concentrations. Both C-60 and C-60-COOH destroyed the fibrous structure of the mycelia. The ultrastructure of P. chrysosporium was changed by C-60-COOH. Pristine C-60 did not affect the enzyme activity of the P. chrysosporium culture system while C-60-COOH completely blocked the enzyme activity. Consequently, in the liquid culture, P. chrysosporium lost the decomposition activity at high C-60-COOH concentrations. The decreased capability in degrading wood was observed for P. chrysosporium exposed to C-60-COOH. Our results collectively indicate that chemical functionalization enhanced the toxicity of fullerene to white rot fungi and induced the loss of decomposition activity. The environmental risks of fullerene and its disturbance to the carbon cycle are discussed.

AB Background: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a cause of intestinal microbial dysbiosis and impaired gut barrier function. This may contribute to life-threatening parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease and sepsis in infants. We compared the effects of a lipid emulsion containing long-chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; SMOFlipid) and a predominantly -6 PUFA emulsion (Intralipid) on microbial composition and host response at the mucosal surface. Materials and Methods: Neonatal piglets were provided isocaloric, isonitrogenous TPN for 14 days versus sow-fed (SF) controls. Equivalent lipid doses (10 g/kg/d) were given of either SMOFlipid (ML; n = 10) or Intralipid (SO; n = 9). Ileal segments and mucosal scrapings were used to characterize microbial composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative gene expression of tight junction proteins, mucins, antimicrobial peptides, and inflammatory cytokines. Results: The microbial composition of TPN piglets differed from SF, while ML and SO differed from each other (analysis of molecular variance; P < .05); ML piglets were more similar to SF, as indicated by UniFrac distance (P < .05). SO piglets showed a specific and dramatic increase in Parabacteroides (P < .05), while ML showed an increase in Enterobacteriaceae (P < .05). Gene expression of mucin, claudin 1, -defensin 2, and interleukin 8 were higher in TPN; overall increases were significantly less in ML versus SO (P < .05). Conclusion: The formulation of parenteral lipid is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and host response of TPN-fed neonatal piglets. Inclusion of -3 long-chain PUFAs appears to improve host-microbial interactions at the mucosal surface, although mechanisms are yet to be defined.

AB Cattleyak (hybrid of cattle and yak) exhibit higher capability in adaptability and production than cattle and yak, while the infertility of F1 males greatly restricts the effective utilization of this hybrid and little progress has been made on investigating the mechanisms of the cattleyak infertility. Cattleyak individuals at three development stages (10, 12 and 14-month old) were sampled in this work and the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification method was employed to identify differences between their testicular proteomes. The proteomic analysis identified 318 proteins differentially expressed with significance at 12-month stage and 327 at 14-month compared with 10-month stage, respectively. Compared with the testicular proteome from 10-month cattleyak, the gene ontology (GO) annotations of the differentially expressed proteins at 12 months did not indicate significant differences from those at 14 months, which confirmed the histological observation that germ cell reduction was more obvious and spermatogenic arrest may become more serious in 12-month-old cattleyak. On the other hand, 56 differentially expressed proteins were coexpressed at 12 and 14-month stage compared with 10-month stage, in which 32 proteins were upregulated and 24 downregulated. GO analysis revealed that most of the differently expressed proteins were involved in the molecular function of catalytic activity, transporter activity, oxidoreductase activity and protein binding. Further analysis indicated that the differently expressed proteins including testis-expressed protein 101 precursor, RNA-binding motif protein, X chromosome, putative RNA-binding protein 3, heparin-binding proteins, tudor domain-containing protein 1, glutathione S-transferases (GSTA2, GSTP1), heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2, estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase11, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and peroxiredoxin-2 were possibly associated with testis development and spermatogenesis, which could be selected as candidate proteins in future study to examine the mechanisms of cattleyak infertility.

AB Hypertension has become a significant global public health concern and is also one of the most common risk factors of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies have shown the promising result of peptides inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in lowering the blood pressure in both animal models and humans. However, the oral bioavailability and continuous antihypertensive effectiveness require further optimization. Novel nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are helpful to overcome these barriers. Therefore, a poly-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticle (PLGANPs) oral delivery system, of the antihypertensive small peptides Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro (VLPVP, VP5) model, was developed in this study and its antihypertensive effect was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) for the first time. The obtained VP5 nanoparticles (VP5-NPs) showed a small particle size of 223.7 +/- 2.3 nm and high entrapment efficiency (EE%) of 87.37% +/- 0.92%. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the nanoparticles were spherical and homogeneous. The optimal preparation of VP5-NPs exhibited sustained release of VP5 in vitro and a 96 h long-term antihypertensive effect with enhanced efficacy in vivo. This study illustrated that PLGANPs might be an optimal formulation for oral delivery of antihypertensive small peptides and VP5-NPs might be worthy of further development and use as a potential therapeutic strategy for hypertension in the future.

AB In this study, novel pH-sensitive micelles were prepared from miktoarm star block copolymer, mPEG-b-P(MMA-co-MAA)(2), by the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique and dialysis method. Molecular structures and characteristics of the micelles were confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The self-assembled micelles have a very low critical micelle concentration, indicating a high colloidal stability in aqueous solution. Methotrexate (MTX) was selected as the model drug of poor solubility. A relatively high drug loading capacity was found, and the in vitro release studies revealed that about 26% of the drug was released in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2) over 48 h compared to the maximum drug release of about 98% in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.4). Thus, the pH-sensitive micelles might serve as promising carriers for oral drug delivery of hydrophobic drugs with controlled release behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study aims to explore the dynamics of the factors influencing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and stability at erosion and deposition sites.
   Thermal properties and dissolved aromatic carbon concentration along with Al, Fe concentration and soil specific surface area (SSA) were studied to 1 meter depth at two contrasting sites.
   Fe, Al concentrations and SSA size increased with depth and were negatively correlated with SOC concentration at the erosion site (P < 0.05), while at the deposition site, these values decreased with increasing depth and were positively correlated with SOC concentration (P < 0.05). TG mass loss showed that SOC components in the two contrasting sites were similar, but the soils in deposition site contained a larger proportion of labile organic carbon and smaller quantities of stable organic carbon compared to the erosion site. SOC stability increased with soil depth at the erosion site. However, it was slightly variable in the depositional zone. Changes in SUVA(254) spectroscopy values indicated that aromatic moieties of DOC at the erosion site were more concentrated in the superficial soil layer (0-20 cm), but at the deposition site they changed little with depth and the SUVA(254) values less than those at the erosion site.
   Though large amounts of SOC accumulated in the deposition site, SOC may be vulnerable to severe losses if environmental conditions become more favorable for mineralization in the future due to accretion of more labile carbon. Deep soil layers at the erosion site (> 30 cm deep) had a large carbon sink potential.

AB Multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles simultaneously possessing thermo-responsive properties and chiral recognition ability show great potential in enantiomeric separation. In this study, a novel type of multifunctional magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticle, decorated with smart polymer brushes consisting of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate) chains with pendent beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) units, was fabricated as a chiral nanoselector for the thermo-sensitive selective adsorption and separation of three amino acid enantiomers. These smart polymer brushes were grafted on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles via a combination of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization and ring-opening reaction. The pendent beta-CD units can serve as smart receptors for selectively recognizing enantiomeric molecules via formation of stable host-guest inclusion complexes. The thermo-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains can act as microenvironmental adjustors for tuning the inclusion constants of beta-CD toward enantiomeric guest molecules. The prepared multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles exhibit excellent thermo-responsive adsorption and decomplexation performances toward amino acid enantiomers. Via simply changing the operation temperature, the decomplexation of amino acid enantiomers and regeneration of the smart chiral magnetic nanoparticles can be easily achieved. Besides, the magnetic properties of the regenerated smart nanoparticles enable easy recovery under an external magnetic field for reuse. Such multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles with highly chiral recognition capability, excellent thermo-sensitive adsorption and decomplexation properties toward amino acid enantiomers, and recyclability show great potential in chiral separations.

AB A total of 150 weanling pigs (body weight of 8.86 +/- 0.93 kg) were used in a 42-day trial to evaluate the efficacy of benzoic acid (BA), essential oils (EO) and Enterococcus faecium SF68. Pigs were randomly distributed into five treatments (six replicates and five pigs per pen): CON, control diet; B5E, CON + 0.5% BA + 0.01% EO; B5SF, CON + 0.5% BA + 7 x 10(8) CFU/kg E. faecium; B3E, CON + 0.3% BA + 0.01% EO; B3SF, CON + 0.3% BA + 7 x 10(8) CFU/kg E. faecium. During d 8-21 and overall, pigs fed B5E diets showed greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain and gain/feed ratio than CON. The dry matter digestibility in pigs fed B5E diet was increased (P < 0.05) compared with CON at d 21, while the nitrogen digestibility in B5E, B5SF and B3E was increased (P < 0.01) compared with CON. Faecal Lactobacillus counts were increased in B5E, whereas E. coli counts were decreased in B5E and B5SF (P < 0.01) compared with CON. All the supplementation treatments decreased (P < 0.05) the faecal NH3, total mercaptans and H2S emission. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of 0.5% BA plus 0.01% EO and 7 x 10(8) CFU E. faecium/kg of diet could improve growth performance, decrease faecal E. coli counts, while 0.3% BA combination with EO or E. faecium almost had no effect on the parameters except the decreased faecal noxious gas contents.

AB Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1) is an inflammation responsive protein that is mainly produced by immunocytes. As a pro-inflammatory cytokine, AIF-1 is a key moderator in host immune defense reaction. However, the inflammatory properties of AIF-1 in freshwater fish still hasn't been clearly elucidated. In the present study, AIF-1 was identified from grass carp (Ctenopharynogodon idella). It's transcript was found in all examined tissues including brain, spleen, kidney, liver, heart, while a relative low level in red muscle, gill, thymus, white muscle, intestine and fin. Furthermore, AIF-1 transcription and expression level decreased in spleen and didn't change a lot in kidney with cadmium induction, respectively. The result indicated that grass carp AIF-1 might be involved in cadmium-induced stress. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The FABP (adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein) genes play an important role in intracellular fatty acid transport and considered to be candidate genes for fatness traits in domestic animal. In this study, we cloned the cDNA sequences of goat FABP family genes and their expression patterns were detected by semi-quantitative RTPCR and quantitative real time RT-PCR. Expression analysis showed that goat FABP1 gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and large intestine. While FABP4 was widely expressed in many tissues with a high expression level was observed in the fat, skeletal muscle, stomach and lung. Notably, FABP2 gene was expressed specifically in small intestine. Moreover, goat FABP3 was expressed at 60 day with the highest level, then significantly (p < 0.01) decreased at the 90 day. No significant expression differences were observed in longissimus dorsi muscles among 3 day, 30 day and 60 day. Goat FABP4 was expressed at 3 day with the lowest level, then significantly (p < 0.01) increased to a peak at the 60 day. In addition, a significant relationship between FABP3 mRNA expression levels and intramuscular fat (IMF) content was observed. These results suggest that the FABP3 and FABP4 may be important genes for meat quality and provides useful information for further studies on their roles in skeletal muscle IMF deposit.

AB Lithium (Li) dendrite is one of the most fatal obstacles for developing practical high energy Li metal batteries, while Li alloy substrates, with strong lithiophilicity, have attracted increasing interest for directing uniform Li deposition. However, most of the previous research studies associated Li dendrite inhibition closely with high adsorption energy. Yet, the Li deposition process is not solely about the adsorption of an isolated Li atom, where a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial lattice mismatch and the Li atom diffusion should also be taken into account. Here, we explore the Li deposition behavior from adhesion work, representing interfacial stability and bonding strength, and both Li adsorption and diffusion. It is found that the overpotential of Li deposition is inversely related to adhesion work, while uniform Li deposition requires a high adsorption energy and low Li atom diffusion barrier. These detailed relationships may offer guidance for subsequent substrate development.

AB After successfully addressing to mitigate bitterness of naringin through construction Pickering emulsion using pea protein (PP) and naringin (NG) in our previous study, we now probed thermal stability, antioxidant efficacy, and bioavailability. FTIR analysis and UV-vis spectroscopy indicated predominant interactions between PP and NG were hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds. TGA and DSC analyses demonstrated that PP-NG complexes exhibited superior heat-resistance compared to pure PP and NG. Thermal stability assessments indicated a significant retention of NG in the PP-NG Pickering emulsion than the control NG across varied temperatures (4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 65 degrees C). Moreover, the antioxidant activity of PP-NG emulsion was dependent on the concentration of NG, as evidenced by DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging abilities, ferric reducing power, and lipid peroxidation resistance. Additionally, PP-NG Pickering emulsion exhibited substantially high bioavailability (92.01 +/- 3.91%). These results suggest a promising avenue for the application of NG with improved characteristics.

AB The cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction is the most direct and efficient method for constructing alpha-tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which avoids the pre-activation of C(sp(3))-H substrates. However, the use of transition metals and harsh reaction conditions are still significant challenges for these reactions that urgently require solutions. This paper presents a mild, metal-free CDC reaction for the construction of ATAAs, which is compatible with various benzyl C-H substrates, functionalized C-H substrates, and alkyl substrates, with good regioselectivity. Notably, our method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and late-stage applicability. According to mechanistic studies, the one-step synthesized and bench-stable N-alkoxyphtalimide generates a highly electrophilic trifluoro ethoxy radical that serves as a key intermediate in the reaction process and acts as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent. Therefore, our metal-free and additive-free method offers a promising strategy for the synthesis of ATAAs under mild conditions.

AB The communication industry has been developing rapidly, but there is still a huge challenge in low dielectric materials. Porous polymer materials have been extensively studied as low dielectric materials. However, their application is limited by poor mechanical properties, high water absorption, etc. In this work, fluorinated poly (arylene ether nitrile) containing carboxyl groups (PEN) are designed and synthesized and then MOF-3 is used as a nanoporous filler and crosslinker. Through simple heat treatment, cross-linked networks are constructed and the overall performance of the composite films has been significantly improved. Benefiting from the introduction of cross-linked networks and the porous structure of MOF-3, the dielectric constant of PEN-M-3 composite films is as low as 2.33 at 1 MHz, and the water uptake is as low as 0.126%. In addition, all the composite films have excellent thermal stability (T5% > 490 degrees C) and outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strength > 82 MPa). Such excellent performance will have the potential to be applied to low dielectric materials, and this strategy will also provide a new approach for the design and preparation of low dielectric materials.

AB Informed zoning of protected areas to designate where certain activities can take place is important to their success. The conventional strategy has been to design protected areas based on flagship species; however, this has often proven ineffective for protecting other sympatric wildlife. Here, using China's Giant Panda National Park (GPNP) as an example, we evaluated the effectiveness of integrating multiple conservation parameters for flagship and sympatric endangered species to optimize zoning designations, without compromising or jeop-ardizing the primary goal of protecting giant pandas. We conducted a stepwise spatial prioritization according to taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity for 48 endangered bird and 23 mammal species. Conservation priority areas for each taxon were spatially congruent across diversity indices but differed between taxa. Species richness provided only a weak indicator of conservation values. The current designation scheme for giant panda protection performs moderately well in terms of sheltering sympatric endangered birds and mammals, but there is still scope for improvement. After balancing competing land uses, we identified 7731 km2 with the highest conservation values across taxa and diversity indices, with 26 % of this optimal priority area lying outside of current core protection zones of the GPNP. We recommend that GPNP's current zoning designation criteria are modified to conserve a broader range of species alongside giant pandas, especially to better protect sites from human disturbance. Our findings also have the broader potential to inform conservation planning for protected areas worldwide, enabling the protection of flagship species to be integrated with broader regional biodiversity conservation.

AB Piezoelectric wearable electronics, which can sense external pressure, have attracted widespread attention. However, the enhancement of electromechanical coupling performance remains a great challenge. Here, a new solid solution of Ba1-xSrxSn0.09Ti0.91O3 (x = 0.00 similar to 0.08) is prepared to explore potential high-performance, lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. The coexistence of the rhombohedral phase, orthorhombic phase and tetragonal phase is determined in a ceramic with x = 0.06, showing enhanced electrical performance with a piezoelectric coefficient of d(33)similar to 650 pC/N. Furthermore, Ba0.94Sr0.06Sn0.09Ti0.91O3 (BSST) is co-blended with PDMS to prepare flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and their performance is explored. The effects of inorganic particle concentration and distribution on the piezoelectric output of the composite are systematically analyzed by experimental tests and computational simulations. As a result, the optimal V-OC and I-SC of the PENG (40 wt%) can reach 3.05 V and 44.5 nA, respectively, at 138.89 kPa, and the optimal sensitivity of the device is up to 21.09 mV/kPa. Due to the flexibility of the device, the prepared PENG can be attached to the surface of human skin as a sensor to monitor vital movements of the neck, fingers, elbows, spine, knees and feet of people, thus warning of dangerous behavior or incorrect posture and providing support for sports rehabilitation.

AB Oxygen vacancies occupation and coordination environment modulation of the transition-metal based electrodes are effective strategies to improve the structural stability and electrochemical performance. In this work, the 2-methylimidazole (2-MI) doped manganese dioxide (MnO2) anchored on carbon cloth (CC) is fabricated via a simple method (MI-MnO2-x/CC), where the oxygen defects on/inside the K. doped 8-MnO2 nanosheets are in-situ created by reductive ethanol/Mn2. and occupied by 2-MI ligands. With the pre-embedded K. ions and abundant ligand-refilled defects, the electronic coordination structure, struc-tural stability and electron/ion diffusion efficiency can be effectively enhanced. Therefore, the MI-MnO2-x/CC reveals a remarkable specific capacitance of 721.2 mF cm-2 with excellent cycle durability (capac-itance retention of 93.4% after 10,000 cycles) under 1.3 V operation potential window. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by MI-MnO2-x/CC and activated mechanical exfoliated graphene oxide yields a maximum energy density of 57.0 Wh kg-1 and a highest power density of 23.0 kW kg-1 under 2.3 V. This effective oxygen defect stabilization strategy by ligands refilling can be extended to var-ious metal oxide-based electrodes for energy storage and conversion.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB Raising crops production via improving photosynthesis has always been focused. Recently excavating and increasing the photosynthetic capacity of non-leaf organs becomes an important approach to crops yield increase. Here we studied the photosynthetic characteristics of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs including the sheath, the glume and the lemma under greenhouse. The relative water content (RWC), the stomatal characteristics, the photosynthetic pigment contents, the enzyme activities in C-3 and C-4 pathway and the malate content of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs on 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after anthesis (denoted by 7DAA, 14DAA, 21DAA, and 28DAA) were determined under well-watered (CK) and water-stressed (D) treatments. Drought stress significantly reduced the RWC of the flag leaf and the non-leaf organs, while the variation of RWC in the glume and the lemma was lower than in the flag leaf. The chlorophyll a content, the chlorophyll b content, the total chlorophyll content and the xanthophyll content in the flag leaf were significantly decreased under D. However, drought stress significantly increased the photosynthetic pigment contents in the glume at the late stage (21DAA and 28DAA). In addition, the induced activities of PEPC, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PPDK in non-leaf organs under drought stress suggested that the C-4 photosynthetic pathway in non-leaf organs compensated the limited C-3 photosynthesis in the flag leaf. Non-leaf organs, in particular the glume, showed the crucial function in maintaining the stable photosynthetic performance of oat.

AB Purpose This study explores how firms develop innovation ecosystems through forming alliances with suppliers and the effects on innovation, economics and consumer welfare. Design/methodology/approach This study develops two game theory models to compare supply chain structures with and without ecosystem alignment. (1) A single supplier provides components to two competing manufacturers (one innovative and one non-innovative). (2) An innovative manufacturer (focal firm) aligns with a supplier that also supplies components to a competing manufacturer. Findings An ecosystem construction strategy that alliances use to reconfigure coopetitive relationships and ecosystem alignment is identified. A manufacturer aligning with a supplier will strengthen the monopoly of the alignment, which is beneficial to both Allies but always harmful to the competitor. Interestingly, such an ecosystem construction strategy may be beneficial to future innovation, the industry and consumers. Research limitations/implications The findings raise several topics that warrant further exploration. For example, scenarios with multiple suppliers were not considered. Furthermore, the implementation of regulatory measures to mitigate the harmful effects of alignment on innovation should be investigated. Practical implications This paper provides a guide for enterprises seeking alignment and to the corresponding measures required to stimulate innovation within ecosystems. What's more, the aligned firm should not always attempt to win the race but should instead take measures to encourage the competitor to share demand information. Originality/value Firstly, most research on supply chain management has focused on its economic impacts. There is a lack of research on the influence of ecosystem alignment on the innovation incentives of firms. Furthermore, the literature still lacks evidence of how ecosystem construction strategies can increase consumer welfare. In the present study, the authors model a complex market structure that includes a competitor, which is becoming increasingly common in high-tech markets. Thirdly, this paper is one of the few that examines the impacts of market-structure changes on innovation incentives. Most importantly, this study extends the current literature by studying coopetition in the ecosystem context.

AB Traditionally, Ya'an Tibetan tea is routinely consumed by local people in the Tibet region. It is believed to possess promising anti-inflammatory benefits. This study was conducted to elucidate the protective impact of Tibetan tea extract (TTE) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Mice were split into four groups: control (C) group, Tibetan tea (T) group, DSS-induced model (CD) group, and Tibetan tea + DSS (TD) group. The intake of TTE significantly reduced the clinical symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC) by alleviating the impact of cellular damage and reducing glandular hypertrophy and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. UC led to a prominent shift of the microbial communities in the gut. Interestingly, the beneficial microbes, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium choerinum, and Lactobacillus intestinalis, were significantly increased in TTE-treated mice when compared to any other experimental group. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the positive effect of TTE on UC could be attributed to changes in the G alpha (i) signaling pathway and the innate immune system. The genes related to inflammation and immune system pathways were differentially expressed in the TTE-treated group. Moreover, the relative expression of genes linked to the inflammatory TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway was significantly downregulated toward the level of normal control samples in the TD group. Overall, this study revealed the modulatory effect by which TTE reversed the development and severity of chronic colon damage.

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have various applications because of their unique structures and properties. The environmental impacts of MOF materials are crucial for their healthy development and the facile detoxification approaches are highly demanded. Herein, we proposed that carbonization could reduce the toxicity of MOF materials to white-rot fungi and alleviate inhibition to decomposition activity, which biodegrade straw and wood in carbon cycle. A representative MOF material MOF-199 was facilely carbonized by annealing to prepare CMOF-199. The bio-effects of MOF-199 and CMOF-199 to white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium were compared. MOF-199 inhibited the fresh weight gain of P. chrysosporium, destroyed the mycelia and induced more oxidative stress than CMOF-199. In particular, MOF-199 completely inhibited the laccase and manganese peroxidase activities at 100 mu g/mL, and the decomposition activity of P. chrysosporium was decreased according to the decoloration of reactive brilliant red X-3B. In contrast, CMOF-199 had very limited influence on the enzyme activities and decomposition capability. Our results collectively highlighted that carbonization reduced the release of Cu2+ from MOF-199 and efficiently reduced the environmental hazards of MOF materials to reserve the biodegradation activity of white-rot fungi.

This article extends the broad learning system (BLS) to a framework for constructing robust representations in low-dimensional and small data sets. First, the BLS changed from a supervised prediction method to an ensemble feature extraction method. Second, feature extraction methods instead of random mapping are used to generate mapped features. Third, deep representations, called enhancement features, are learned from the ensemble mapped features. Fourth, data for generating mapped features and enhancement features can be randomly selected. The ensemble of mapped features and enhancement features can provide robust representations to enhance the performance of downstream tasks. A label-based autoencoder (LA) is embedded in the BLS framework as an example to show the effectiveness of the framework. A random LA (RLA) is presented to generate more different features. The experimental results show that the BLS framework can construct robust representations and significantly promote the performance of machine learning models.

AB Precise therapy has become prevalent in clinical practice owing to its accurate and efficient targeting treatment of diseases. Such treatments involving polymersomes as carriers have great potential to lesion sites without damage to normal tissues. However, due to the inherent thick hydrophobic layer of polymersomes, an instantaneous release response to external stimuli remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, here, we report on the synthesis and applications of azobenzene-containing photochromic vesicles as delivery vectors. These vesicles are assembled from small-molecule amphiphiles that have been developed to provide a fast response and promote instantaneous release due to molecular size reduction compared with macromolecular polymersomes. After cross-linking, the stability of vesicles under a physiological environment is notably enhanced. By varying UV and visible light irradiation, the "gate" of vesicles can be opened and closed reversibly for the controlled release of capsuled cargoes. In vitro experiments display that the vesicles can be applied to load cysteamine for eliminating excess reactive oxygen. The synthesized vesicles here show high performance in controlled and instantaneous release in cells both in time and space. By our approach, oxidative damage to cellular biomolecules can be substantially reduced.

ID STABILIZATION
AB Highly charged superparamagnetic Fe3O4 colloidal nanocrystal clusters (CNCs) with uniform and widely tunable sizes can be magnetically assembled into responsive photonic crystals to exhibit rapid and reversible brilliant structural color changes under an external magnetic field. We herein investigated a robust and easily scalable solvothermal synthesis of CNCs using anionic polyelectrolyte, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) sodium salt (PSSMA), as the capping ligand. The molar ratio of the two acid segments was found to greatly affect the surface charges of the resulting CNCs and thus their photonic properties, with a higher surface charge for particles synthesized with ligands of a higher SS/MA ratio. Moreover, the dosage of PSSMA (3 : 1) and the molar ratio of acetate ions to iron ions (Ac-/Fe3+) in the reactants also had significant effects on the sizes and surface charges of the obtained CNCs and thus their photonic properties. These parameters can be easily optimized to produce CNCs with strong optical diffractions and wide tunability of diffraction wavelengths in various solvents in response to an external magnetic field. This synthetic method can be easily scaled up to 20 folds, producing similar to 3.32 g of nanoparticles in one batch with excellent photonic properties. This work is expected to impact significantly the field of magnetically responsive photonic structures by providing easy access to high-quality superparamagnetic colloidal nanoparticles.

AB Solid edible fat obtained by hydrogenation of vegetable oils is widely used in food market. However, the produced partially hydrogenated oils usually contain trans-fatty acids, which are harmful to health. It is meaningful to develop effective ways to directly structure edible liquid oil into gel-like state with good stability. Herein, we presented Pickering emulsions cooperatively stabilized by gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) and dialdehyde starch nanoparticles (DASNPs) to structure liquid vegetable oils into gel state. It is interesting that Schiff's base reactions happened between GNPs and DASNPs on the surface of Pickering emulsion droplets as well as the interface among droplets, which effectively improved the stability of Pickering emulsions. The enhanced stability of Pickering emulsions contributed to the good solidification capacity to liquid oils. As a result, the emulsions could keep structure well after 6 months of storage. Moreover, the dense interfacial layer of Pickering emulsion droplets could protect beta-carotene from being diffused out of the internal phase, indicating the potential of Pickering emulsions as container for encapsulating nutrients. In sum, the developed Pickering emulsion is a good strategy to structure liquid oils.

AB Objective: Duoxuekang (DXK) capsule is an empirical prescription for Tibetan medicine in the treatment of hypobaric hypoxia (HH)-induced brain injury in the plateau. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of DXK on HH-induced brain injury.
   Methods: UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was performed for chemical composition analysis of DXK. The anti-hypoxia and anti-fatigue effects of DXK were evaluated by the normobaric hypoxia test, sodium nitrite toxicosis test, and weight-loaded swimming test in mice. Simultaneously, SD rats were used for the chronic hypobaric hypoxia (CHH) test. RBC, HGB, HCT, and the whole blood viscosity were evaluated. The activities of SOD and MDA in the brain, and EPO and LDH levels in the kidney were detected using ELISA. H&E staining was employed to observe the pathological morphology in the hippocampus and cortex of rats. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot were carried out to detect the protein expressions of Mapk10, RASGRF1, RASA3, Ras, and IGF-IR in the brain of rats. Besides, BALB/c mice were used for acute hypobaric hypoxia (AHH) test, and Western blot was employed to detect the protein expression of p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK, and p-p38/p38 in the cerebral cortex of mice.
   Results: 23 different chemical compositions of DXK were identified by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The anti-hypoxia test verified that DXK can prolong the survival time of mice. The anti-fatigue test confirmed that DXK can prolong the swimming time of mice, decrease the level of LDH, and increase the hepatic glycogen level. Synchronously, DXK can decrease the levels of RBC, HGB, HCT, and the whole blood viscosity under the CHH condition. Besides, DXK can ameliorate CHH-induced brain injury, decrease the levels of EPO and LDH in the kidney, reduce MDA, and increase SOD in the hippocampus. Furthermore, DXK can converse HH-induced marked increase of Mapk10, RASGRF1, and RASA3, and decrease of Ras and IGF-IR. In addition, DXK can suppress the ratio of p-ERK/ERK, p-JNK/JNK, and p-p38/p38 under the HH condition.
   Conclusion: Together, the cerebral protection elicited by DXK was due to the decrease of hematological index, suppressing EPO, by affecting the MAPK signaling pathway in oxidative damage, and regulating the RAS signaling pathway.

AB Public transport is a fundamental service for the resumption of work and production, but the enclosed environment and dense population create very favorable conditions for the spread of epidemic infections. Thus, effective public health interventions are urgently introduced. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability and evaluate the influence of environmental parameters and individual intervention on the epidemic prevention. For this purpose, (1) we estimate the virus emission rate with Diamond Princess Cruise Ship infection data by Monte Carlo simulation and the improved Wells-Riley model, and (2) employ the reproductive number R to quantify diverse mitigation strategies. Different determinants are examined such as the duration of exposure, the number of passengers combined with individual interventions such as mask type and mask-wearing rate. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 quantum generation rate is 185.63. The R shows a stronger positive correlation with the exposure time comparing to the number of passengers. In this light, reducing the frequency of long-distance journeys on crowded public transportation may be required to reduce the spread of the virus during the pandemic. N95 mask and surgical mask can reduce the transmission risk by 97 and 84%, respectively, and even homemade mask can reduce the risk by 67%, which indicates that it is necessary to advocate wearing masks on public transportation.

AB This study explored the relationships between subjective family socioeconomic status (FSES), self-esteem, perceived stress, and perceived peer relationships among Chinese adolescents. A total of 1,353 adolescents (age range: 15-19 years) were asked to complete a questionnaire. Mediation analysis revealed that subjective FSES influenced perceived peer relationships in three ways: first, through the mediating effect of perceived stress; second, through the mediating effect of self-esteem; and third, through the serial mediating effects of perceived stress and self-esteem. The results remained significant after controlling for parental education. In addition, a contrast analysis showed no significant differences in the mediating effects of self-esteem and perceived stress. Thus, we suggest that steps should be taken to improve adolescents' self-esteem and reduce their stress through training interventions and preventive measures, to help them improve their perceived peer relationships and reduce adverse effects associated with low subjective FSES.

TI Multiple-Coated PLGA Nanoparticles Loading Triptolide Attenuate Injury
   of a Cellular Model of Alzheimer's Disease
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta proteins (A beta). It has been reported that triptolide (TP), an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agent extracted from a Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, shows potential neuroprotective effects pertinent to AD. However, the clinical use of TP for AD could be hampered due to its high toxicity, instability, poor water solubility, and nonspecific biodistribution after administration. In this paper, we reported a kind of multiple-coated PLGA nanoparticle with the entrapment of TP and surface coated by chitosan hydrochloride, Tween-80, PEG20000, and borneol/mentholum eutectic mixture (MC-PLGA-TP-NP) as a novel nasal brain targeting preparation for the first time. The obtained MC-PLGA-TP-NP was 147.5 +/- 20.7 nm with PDI of 0.263 +/- 0.075, zeta potential of 14.62 +/- 2.47 mV, and the entrapment efficiency and loading efficiency of 93.14% +/- 4.75% and 1.17 +/- 0.08%, respectively. In comparison of TP, MC-PLGA-TP-NP showed sustained-release profile and better transcellular permeability to Caco-2 cells in vitro. In addition, our data showed that MC-PLGA-TP-NP remarkably reduced the cytotoxicity, attenuated the oxidative stress, and inhibited the increase of the intracellular Ca2+ influx in differentiated PC12 cells induced by beta(1.)(42). Therefore, it can be concluded that MC-PLGA-TP-NP is a promising preparation of TP, which exerts a better neuroprotective activity in the AD cellular model.

AB It is urgently needed to develop novel adjuvants for improving the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with high surface area, play an important role in drug delivery. With perfect biocompatibility and green preparation process, the gamma-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (gamma-CD-MOF) fabricated with cyclodextrin and potassium suitable for antigen delivery. In this study, we modified gamma-CD-MOF with span-85 to fabricate the SP-gamma-CD-MOF as animal vaccine adjuvants. The ovalbumin (OVA) as the model antigen was encapsulated into particles to investigate the immune response. SP-gamma-CD-MOF displayed excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. After immunization, SP-gamma-CD-MOF loaded with OVA could induce high antigen-specific IgG titers and cytokine secretion. Meanwhile, SP-gamma-CD-MOF also significantly improved the proliferation of spleen cells and activated and matured the bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs). The study showed the potential of SP-gamma-CD-MOF in vaccine adjuvants and provided a novel idea for the development of vaccine adjuvants.

AB A series of ZnO-based complex architectures including Mn-doped ZnO, Ag/ZnO and Ag-decorated Mn:ZnO nanocomposites were fabricated by a facile polymer network gel method. The photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized products was evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The Mn:ZnO/Ag photocatalyst achieves the superior photodegradation efficiency, which is three times higher than that of pure ZnO and two times that of the Ag/ZnO composite. Our results demonstrate that the significantly enhanced photocatalytic properties of Mn:ZnO/Ag are due to the synergetic effects of both Mn doping and Ag decoration. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of Mn:ZnO/Ag for degradation of organic dyes is proposed. The transformation from Mn3+ to Mn2+, the increase of surface defects, and the improvement of the crystal quality are the crucial factors for the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties. This study provides an effective approach to overcome the response limitation of ZnO-based photocatalysts in the visible region and realize efficient photogenerated carrier separation.

AB Habitat evaluation constitutes an important and fundamental step in the management of wildlife populations and conservation strategy planning. The buff-throated partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii) is a medium-sized Galliform species with national conservation priority endemic to the high mountains of western China, yet its habitat status across its distribution range has not been studied. We predicted current potential suitable habitats for the buff-throated partridge in China with 155 presence points collected between 2005 and 2019, using MaxEnt modeling. The predicted habitat of the buff-throated partridge covered an area of 191,259 km(2), with highly suitable habitat concentrated in Shaluli and Daxueshan Mountains, with marginal habitat patches of lower suitability scattered over Mangkang, Yunling, Nushan and Nyainqe<^>ntanglha Mountains. The most suitable habitat for buff-throated partridge was associated with environmental variables isothermality (similar to 45), moderate annual rainfall (678 mm), lower human population density (<30 people/ km(2)), and steep slope at an elevation of 4000 m a.s.l. Our study suggested that although the area of buff-throated partridge habitat was large, its highly suitable habitat was restricted and fragmented due to the natural barriers of major rivers and increased human disturbance. Therefore, the status of buff-throated partridge habitat was not promising, and we proposed three recommendations for conservation strategy being 1) highest conservation priorities for the species being protection of its core distribution and habitat ranging from southwestern Sichuan to northern Yunnan, especially several national nature reserves in these regions; 2) design corridors to facilitate population communication and genetic diversity; 3) restrictions on human disturbance such as free-ranging yak grazing in buff-throated partridge habitat.

AB Pheasants (order Galliformes) are typical ground-dwelling birds, having a large body size and weak flight abilities. Sympatric pheasants are expected to share narrower niche space and face more extensive interspecific competition. However, little work has been undertaken simultaneously to investigate niche partitioning among sympatric pheasant species across multiple ecological dimensions. We compared microhabitat use, activity pattern and foraging strategy of sympatric Blood Pheasant Ithaginis cruentus, Buff-throated Partridge Tetraophasis szechenyii and White Eared-pheasant Crossoptilon crossoptilon on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, to identify potential interspecific niche partitioning along different ecological dimensions in the breeding season. We found that the Buff-throated Partridge differed significantly from the other two species in microhabitat use, and the three species showed different foraging strategies. It is likely that niche partitioning reduced potential interspecific competition, thus facilitating the species' stable coexistence. Our study provides practical evidence of multidimensional niche theory within sympatric ground-dwelling pheasant species, emphasizing that species interactions and coexistence within a guild are often not uni-dimensional. Given global conservation concern for maintaining bird diversity, we recommend further restriction of yak grazing in these species' habitat.

AB The 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methyl-butanoic acid are known as fingerprint compounds from Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we investigated production of these two volatile biomarkers and their correlation to S. aureus growth in pork. Both 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methyl-butanoic acid presented high specificity for S. aureus in either media or pork. In sterile minced pork and pork broth, production of volatile biomarkers and the growth of S. aureus were significantly correlated for most single cultures. However, for mixed cultures, only 3-methyl-butanoic acid indicated correlations with growth of S. aureus. Similar trending was also discovered in raw pork, where production of 3-methyl-butanoic acid was significantly correlated with the growth of S. aureus, but not for 3-methyl-butanal. In summary, 3-methyl-butanoic acid was a more stable metabolic marker than 3-methyl-butanal which could be used as an indicator for the presence of S. aureus in pork. This rapid, convenient and cost-effective detection approach could be applied in meat industry to achieve specific detection of S. aureus.

AB Chiral allenes are important structural scaffolds found in many natural products and drugs, and in addition, they also serve as building blocks for many organic transformations. The conventional methods for preparing chiral allenes rely on the resolution of racemic allenes and the chirality transfer between non-racemic propargylic derivatives and nucleophilic reagents. In recent years, the synthesis of chiral allenes by asymmetric catalysis has been achieved fruitful results. Among them, enantioselective synthesis of chiral allenes with chiral organic catalysts is particularly prominent. in this paper, the research progress of enantioselective synthesis of chiral allenes catalyzed by chiral organic catalysts in recent years is reviewed, including various reaction systems and synthesis applications.

AB Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) plays a critical role in the regulation of lipid metabolism; however, its function in goat intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition remains unknown. To explore the role of FGF21 for goat IMF deposition, we performed gain and loss function of FGF21 in intramuscular adipocyte. Our results showed that overexpression of FGF21 mediated by adenovirus inhibits lipid accumulation of goat intramuscular adipocyte, accompanied by down-regulating the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), but up-regulating counterpart of preadipocyte factor1 (Pref1). Conversely, siRNAs knocking down FGF21 promotes the expression of PPAR gamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBP alpha) but suppressed that of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and Pref1. Meanwhile, we found that FGF21 regulates the expression of many KLFs transcription factors, such as KLF3, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 16. These findings demonstrate a key role of FGF21 as a negative factor in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation in goat intramuscular preadipocyte.

AB Revegetation is an effective strategy for enhancing soil quality, but the impact of revegetation on soil processes is currently not well understood, especially in subhumid desert lands across a chronosequence of recovery. Therefore, this study aims to assess the soil nutrients and enzyme activities under successive (from 2013 to 2016) revegetation by Avena sativa, Festuca sinensis and Elymus nutans in subhumid desert on the southeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (STN), total phosphorus (STP), ammonium nitrogen (SAN), nitrate nitrogen (SNN), available phosphorus (SAP), saccharase, alkaline phosphatase and urease activities were measured in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers during the growing season in 2016. The results indicated that the restoration by grasses promoted soil nutrients and enzyme activities, but there was a sharp decrease in soil nutrients and enzyme activities after one-year of recovery in the subhumid desert. Compared to the control, revegetation significantly decreased the SOC (36.5%), STN (40.8%), STP (31.5%), saccharase (44.7%), urease (38.5%) and alkaline phosphatase (18.0%) activities in the 0-10 cm soil layer (P < 0.05) after one-year restoration. Recovering by grasses was an efficient way to restore the subhumid desert. However, this process might consume large amounts of soil nutrients and limit soil enzyme activities at the beginning succession stage, which was different from dry or semiarid desert land. Choosing a suitable mixing ratio of artificial grasses and adding fertilizer to the soil at the beginning stage of revegetation are advised for restoring desert lands in alpine areas.

AB In the long history of identifying factors to predict academic performance, conscientiousness, a socalled 'big five' personality trait describing self-regulation and goal-directed behavior, has emerged as a stable predictor for this purpose. However, the neuroanatomical substrates of trait conscientiousness and the underlying brain mechanism linking trait conscientiousness and academic performance are still largely unknown. Here, we examined these issues in 148 high school students within the same grade by estimating cortical gray matter volume (GMV) utilizing a voxel-based morphometry method based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that trait conscientiousness was positively associated with the GMV in the bilateral superior parietal lobe (SPL) and was negatively associated with the GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that trait conscientiousness mediated the influences of the SPL and MFG volume on academic performance. Importantly, our results persisted even when we adjusted for general intelligence, family socioeconomic status and 'big five' personality traits other than conscientiousness. Altogether, our study suggests that the GMV in the frontoparietal network is a neurostructura I marker of adolescents' conscientiousness and reveals a potential brain-personality-achievement pathway for predicting academic performance in which gray matter structures affect academic performance through trait conscientiousness.

AB A dual-carrier modulation technique is proposed to improve the performance of the half-bridge resonant converter in this paper. By alternately using two different sawtooth waveforms as a carrier, the dual-carrier modulation combines the characteristics of both variable frequency modulation and fixed-frequency modulation. According to the structure of modulator, there are two kinds of dual-carrier modulation: type A and type B. Type A dual-carrier modulation is suitable for resonant converters operating in inductive region to achieve a wide zero voltage switching (ZVS) range, while type B dual-carrier modulation is preferred for resonant converters operating in capacitive region to obtain a wide zero current switching range. By utilizing both switching frequency modulation and duty ratio modulation, the proposed dual-carrier modulation not only extends soft-switching range of the resonant converter, but also reduces switching frequency variation range. In order to verify the benefits of the proposed modulation, a 500-W dual-carrier modulated LCC resonant converter operating in inductive region is designed and built. Simulation and experimental results show the prototype achieves ZVS soft-switching operation for 200-400 V input voltage and 100-500 W output power, with only about 10 kHz switching frequency variation.

AB Drug delivery systems for doxorubicin (DOX) have attracted tremendous interest nowadays for the improved efficacy and/or reduced toxicity. Due to the aromatic structures and hydrophobic domains, carbon nanoparticle suspension injection (CNSI), a clinical applied reagent for lymph node mapping, strongly adsorbs DOX and holds great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of CNSI-DOX to establish its delivery applications for cancer drugs. CNSI adsorbed DOX from solution quickly after the mixing, and the release of DOX from CNSI followed a pH-dependent way. CNSI-DOX and free DOX had nearly identical inhibitive effects on cancer cells, while the vehicle CNSI was nontoxic. CNSI-DOX largely prolonged the life span of ascites tumor bearing mice after the intraperitoneally injection and the ascites weights showed significant decreases. CNSI-DOX also inhibited the growth of subcutaneous xenografts following the same administration route. The therapeutic efficacy of CNSI-DOX was similar to that of free DOX in ascites tumor model, but slightly lower in subcutaneous xenografts model. The advantage of using CNSI was majorly reflected by the reduced toxicity of DOX according to the bodyweight changes, serum biochemical indicators and histopathological observations. The LD50 (median lethal dose) value of CNSI-DOX was 43.8 mg/kg bodyweight, nearly three times of that of free DOX (15.2 mg/kg bodyweight). Our results suggested that CNSI might be used for DOX delivery through "off label" use to benefit the patients immediately.

AB Goat intramuscular fat (IMF) content is mainly determined by the processes of intramuscular preadipocytes adipogenic differentiation and mature adipocyte lipid accumulation. However, the underlying regulators of these biological processes remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the expression of Liver X receptor alpha (LXR) reaches a peak at early stage and then gradually decreases during goat intramuscular adipogenesis. Knockdown of LXR mediated by two independent siRNAs significantly inhibits intramuscular adipocytes lipid accumulation and upregulates preadipocytes marker- preadipocyte factor 1 (pref1) expression. Consistently, siRNA treatments robustly decrease mRNA level of adipogenic related genes, including CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebp), Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), Sterol regulatory element binding protein isoform 1c (Srebp1c), Fatty acids binding protein (aP2) and Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl). Next, adenovirus overexpression of LXR does not affect intramuscular adipocytes adipogenesis manifested by Oil Red O signal measurement and adipogenic specific genes detection. Mechanically, we found that both CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (Cebp) and Kruppel like factor 8 (Klf8) are potential targets of LXR, indicated by having putative binding sites of LXR at the promoter of these genes and similar expression pattern during adipogenesis comparing to LXR. Importantly, mRNA levels of Cebp and Klf8 are downregulated significantly in goat LXR knockdown intramuscular adipocyte. These results demonstrate that loss function of LXR inhibits intramuscular adipogenesis possibly through down-regulation of Cebp and Klf8. Our research will provide new insights into mechanical regulation of goat IMF deposition.

AB This paper is concerned with distributionally robust chance constrained problem under interval distribution information. Using worst-case CVaR approximation, we present a tractable convex programming approximation for distributionally robust individual chance constrained problem under interval sets of mean and covariance information. We prove the worst-case CVaR approximation problem is an exact form of the distributionally robust individual chance constrained problem. Then, our result is applied to worst-case Value-at-Risk optimization problem. Moreover, we discuss the problem under several ambiguous distribution information and investigate tractable approximations for distributionally robust joint chance constrained problem. Finally, we provide an illustrative example to show our results.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate canine astrovirus (CaAstV) infection in southwest China. We collected 107 faecal samples from domestic dogs with obvious diarrhoea. Forty-two diarrhoeic samples (39.3 %) were positive for CaAstV by RT-PCR, and 41/42 samples showed co-infection with canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV). Phylogenetic analysis based on 26 CaAstV partial ORF1a and ORF1b sequences revealed that most CaAstV strains showed unique evolutionary features. Interestingly, putative recombination events were observed among four of the five complete ORF2 sequences cloned in this study, and three of the five complete ORF2 sequences formed a single unique group, suggesting that these strains could be a novel genotype. We successfully sequenced the complete genome of one CaAstV strain (designated 2017/44/CHN), which was 6628 nt in length. The features of this genome include putative recombination events in the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 genes, while the ORF2 gene had a continuous insertion of 7 as in region II compared with the other complete ORF2 sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 2017/44/CHN formed a single group based on genome sequences, suggesting that this strain might be a novel genotype. The results of this study revealed that CaAstV circulates widely in diarrhoeic dogs in southwest China and exhibits unique evolutionary events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of recombination events in CaAstV, and it contributes to further understanding of the genetic evolution of CaAstV.

AB Nitroaromatic compounds pose a significant risk to human health and other living organisms. However, conventionally high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods are complicated and time-consuming for complete separation of multiple nitroaromatic compounds due to their high structure-similarity. In the work, a facile yet effective strategy, which combines HPLC embedded by diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), is explored to improve the HPLC analysis. Based on the strategy, seven nitroaromatic compounds with similar structures could be rapidly quantified under a simple isocratic elution condition (acetonitrile/water: 65:35, v/v) within 10 min. With the aid of the second-order advantage of MCR-ALS, acceptable quantification results are still achieved for the real water samples, despite of significantly overlapping peaks resulted from the similar structures of the analytes and the unexpected interferences from the real water sample. The error analysis and the elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) test further confirm the reliability of the predicted result. Thereby, the HPLC method coupled with the second-order calibration algorithm could provide a simple, quick and accurate strategy for simultaneous determination on the multiple nitroaromatic compounds in environmental monitoring.

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY

ID CARBON-STEEL; SURFACTANTS; POLYESTERS; ACID
AB In this study, a new type of scale and corrosion inhibitors with hyper-branched structure has been developed. They have higher efficiency compared with the existing inhibitors used for industrial water treatment. The terminal amino phosphate group of hyper-branched polymers (HBPs) was synthesized through Michael addition and amidation reactions. The scale inhibition efficiency of the obtained products was determined according to their ability to prevent crystallization of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate at the optimal application conditions. The experimental result shows that HBPs at 20 mg L-1 provides a scale inhibiting efficiency for CaCO3 and CaSO4 up to 96.7% and 93.9%, respectively. In addition, the effect of HBPs inhibition on A3 carbon steel corrosion in 3 wt% NaCl medium was investigated by the weight loss and electrochemical measurements. The polarization measurements indicate that the prepared HBPs act as a cathodic type inhibitor. The weight loss test shows that the corrosion inhibition efficiency depends on the concentration and reaches 91.3% at 100 mg L-1. The SEM and XRD analyses show that the good scale inhibition performance of HBPs is attributed to the ability to inhibit the formation of crystals and then destroy them. The study of the adsorption thermodynamics and the reaction kinetics of the corrosion process together with the SEM analysis show that the good corrosion inhibition of HBPs is derived from the carbon steel surface immersed in solution with HBPs which can induce the formation of a dense protective adsorption film layer, preventing the corrosion reaction with the surface of the carbon steel. The achieved results indicate that the prepared HBPs have a great potential for application in industrial water treatment.

AB Ants are important soil engineers, affecting the structure and function of ecosystems. To address the impacts of ants (Camponotus herculeanus) on the properties of an alpine meadow ecosystem of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we investigated the effects of ant mounds on plant biomass, soil physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and functions. We found that the total biomass of plant community was significantly greater in ant mound periphery. Plant species richness in ant mounds was reduced compared with that of control plots without ant mounds. Significant changes in physicochemical properties of soil were also observed. Soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, total potassium, and available potassium increased in ant mound soil due to the excavation activities by ants as well as the accumulation of organic matter and other nutrients during mound construction. For example, roots/soil contents (g/g) and soil moisture in ant mound soils were lower than those in controls. Microbial community composition and microbial biomass were clearly changed in ant mound soils. BIOLOG analysis further indicated that the functional diversity of the microbial community of ant mound soil increased and differed from that of controls. This study indicates that ant-induced modification of soil properties indirectly influences plant biomass and species composition, and ant mounds have different microbial communities from those of control soil.

AB Alternative splicing (AS), as one of the most important topics in the post-genomic era, has been extensively studied in numerous organisms. However, little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of AS in Echinococcus species, which can cause significant health problems to humans and domestic animals. Based on high-throughput RNA-sequencing data, we performed a genome-wide survey of AS in two major pathogens of echinococcosis-Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis. Our study revealed that the prevalence and characteristics of AS in protoscoleces of the two parasites were generally consistent with each other. A total of 6,826 AS events from 3,774 E. granulosus genes and 6,644 AS events from 3,611 E. multilocularis genes were identified in protoscolex transcriptomes, indicating that 33-36% of genes were subject to AS in the two parasites. Strikingly, intron retention instead of exon skipping was the predominant type of AS in Echinococcus species. Moreover, analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway indicated that genes that underwent AS events were significantly enriched in multiple pathways mainly related to metabolism (e.g., purine, fatty acid, galactose, and glycerolipid metabolism), signal transduction (e.g., Jak-STAT, VEGF, Notch, and GnRH signaling pathways), and genetic information processing (e.g., RNA transport and mRNA surveillance pathways). The landscape of AS obtained in this study will not only facilitate future investigations on transcriptome complexity and AS regulation during the life cycle of Echinococcus species, but also provide an invaluable resource for future functional and evolutionary studies of AS in platyhelminth parasites.

AB A high tap density for cathode active material is desirable because it is beneficial to the improvement of volumetric energy density of Li-ion battery. However, a high tap density for lithium rich layered cathode material was hardly achieved because of the low tap density of spherical precursors with a loose packing of the plate-shaped long rectangular primary particles prepared by the conventional NH3-bearing co-precipitation method in atmosphere of flowing nitrogen. In this article, irregular Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles with a high tap density were prepared using irregular precursors with a tight packing of the spherical primary particles synthesized by a NH3-free co-precipitation method in atmosphere of flowing air. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement indicates that the irregular Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles possess a high gravimetric capacity of 259 mAh g(-1) and a volumetric capacity of 926 mAh cm(-3). The superior electrochemical performance of as-prepared material can be attributed to that the irregular secondary particle have a large specific surface area and small pore volume detected by both nitrogen absorption method and mercury intrusion method and that the primary particle possesses more active planes exposure observed through HR-TEM images.

AB According to the theory of a gas chromatography column, the air flow distribution inside the channel plays a vital role in the peak broadening. Unlike the semi-packed columns which utilized embedded posts to obtain a more uniform lateral distribution compared to the open tubular columns, this paper reports the design and fabrication of a MEMS-based GC column folded in a wavy configuration to achieve an even flow velocity. The wavy column consists of upper arcs and lower arcs which are alternatively connected in series. The flow distributions of wavy columns with various arc angle and curvature radius are explored by the finite element method. The simulation reveals that the average flow velocity decreases with the increase of the arc angle, resulting in a successive improvement of the flow uniformity at the zones between two adjacent bends but also a more nonsymmetric distribution at the bends. These two effects counteract with each other and render an optimal arc angle of 136 degrees. To verify the above design, the 136 degrees wavy column and a serpentine column with the same dimensions are compared, where a better separation performance of the wavy column is demonstrated.

AB Cross regulation is a key technical issue of single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) DC-DC converters. This paper investigates the cross regulation in single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) Buck converters with continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation. The expressions of the DC voltage gain, control to the output transfer function, cross regulation transfer function, cross coupled transfer function and impedance transfer function of the converter are presented by the time averaging equivalent circuit approach. A small signal model of a SIDO CCM Buck converter is built to analyze this cross regulation. The laws of cross regulation with respect to various load conditions are investigated. Simulation and experiment results verify the theoretical analysis. This study will be helpful for converter design to reduce the cross regulation. In addition, a control strategy to reduce cross regulation is performed.

AB The letter presents thermite reactions of Al/Fe2O3 nanothermites simulated by using molecular dynamic method in combination with ReaxFF. The variations in chemical bonds are measured to elaborate reaction process and characterize ignition performance. It is found that the longer interval is, the higher ignition temperature and the longer ignition delay system has. Additionally, the heating rate has much effect on ignition temperature. Under the temperature of 1450 K, oxygen is directly released from hematite nanotube, thermite reaction is deemed as a multiphase process. And, release energy of System2 is abotit 3.96 kJ/g. However, much energy rises from alloy reaction. Thermite reactions do not follow the theoretical equation, but are a complicated process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biodegradable micelles based on disulfide-linked monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)(2) (mPEG-SS-PMMA(2)) miktoarm star block copolymers were synthesized through atom transfer radical polymerization procedure and applied to solubilization and delivery of methotrexate (MTX). The synthesized miktoarm star block copolymers were characterized by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectra, and gel permeation chromatography. The block copolymers were able to self-assemble into spherical micelles in water with an average diameter up to 130 nm by transmission electron microscopy observation and dynamic light scattering measurements and have a critical micelle concentration of 0.91 mg/L. When MTX was incorporated into obtained micelles, high drug loading capacity was found attributed to the designed miktoarm star-shaped nanostructure. Interestingly, in presence of dithiothreitol, the micelles could be degraded into polymer chains by cleavage of the disulfide linkages. The in vitro release studies revealed that these micelles released over 95 % of MTX within 48 h under a reductive environment analogous to that of the cell comparing to minimal drug release (< 22 %) under nonreductive conditions. Cell cytoxicity experiments showed that the obtained micelles exhibited nontoxic, and the drug-loaded micelles exhibited high anticancer efficacy and better biocompatibility as compared to free MTX. All of these results showed that mPEG-SS-PMMA(2) micelles are promising carriers for delivery of hydrophobic antitumor drugs.

AB In order to provide high-security remote authentication, the three-factor authentication scheme combining biometric with smart card and password has been proposed. With a careful review of the recently proposed Lee-Hsu's scheme, this paper points out some design flaws in it. In order to withstand them, a new scheme based on Fuzzy extractors is proposed. With a detail analysis, this paper demonstrates that the proposed scheme is more practical and reasonable. It also has higher security and deals with biometric more appropriately in spite of higher computation cost at client than Lee-Hsu's scheme. Furthermore, an access control method has been introduced in it for the purpose of making different users enjoy different access privileges with regard to the data. What is more, the proposed scheme can also achieve key agreement. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

LA English
DT Article
DE Cooperation; Evolution game; Heterogeneity payoff distribution;
   Punishing evil and promoting good; Reputation mechanism
ID REPUTATION; EVOLUTION; PUNISHMENT
AB The topic of how to solve cooperation dilemmas has been intensively investigated. Numerous mechanisms have been presented to promote cooperation level by introducing various third-party strategies. This paper considers the more realistic strategy named punishing evil and promoting good (PEPG) in the public goods game, whose fundamental action is cooperation. Players selecting this strategy can not only reward cooperators but also penalize defectors, effectively amalgamating the advantages of both rewarders and punishers. Moreover, distinct strategic choices lead to dynamic changes in players' reputation, which in turn significantly influence their income distribution. Notably, individuals with elevated reputation are entitled to allocate more benefits rather than homogeneous distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the PEPG strategy is pivotal in eliminating defectors and fostering cooperative behavior. Importantly, three intriguing phenomena are displayed in this research, including the resurgence of defectors, the polarization of reputation and the disparities of payoffs, all of which help us understand the emergence of cooperation in the real world.

AB Pectic polysaccharides are one of the most vital functional ingredients in quinoa microgreens, which exhibit numerous health-promoting benefits. Nevertheless, the detailed information about the structure-function relationships of pectic polysaccharides from quinoa microgreens (QMP) remains unknown, thereby largely restricting their applications as functional foods or fortified ingredients. Therefore, to unveil the possible structure-function relationships of QMP, the mild alkali de-esterification was utilized to modify QMP, and then the correlations of esterification degrees of native and modified QMPs to their biological functions were systematically investigated. The results showed that the modified QMPs with different esterification degrees were successfully prepared by the mild alkali treatment, and the primary chemical structure (e.g., compositional monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages) of the native QMP was overall stable after the de-esterified modification. Furthermore, the results revealed that the antioxidant capacity, antiglycation effect, prebiotic potential, and immunostimulatory activity of the native QMP were negatively correlated to its esterification degree. In addition, both native and modified QMPs exerted immunostimulatory effects through activating the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. These results are conducive to unveiling the precise structure-function relationships of QMP, and can also promote its applications as functional foods or fortified ingredients.

AB Solar -driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) holds great potential for desalination, but it also poses challenges to application performance. Herein, a novel polyaniline (PANI) modified polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) electrospun nanofibrous membranes (PANI@PEN) was developed by introducing PDA and CTAB, which increased the polymerization amount of PANI and controlled its morphology by sequential in -situ polymerization, aiming to enhance its SDIE comprehensive performance. This unique structure can generate multiple diffuse reflections under sunlight, resulting in the highest water evaporation rate of the nanofibrous membrane at 1.822 kg m - 2 h - 1 , while evaporation rate at 1.527 kg m - 2 h - 1 for a 3.5 wt% sodium chloride solution. Due to the good flexibility of PEN polymer substrate, the obtained membranes can be easily arched, showcasing an interesting ability to collect salt through salt deposition. Meanwhile, PEN also provides a robust skeleton, endowed PANI@PENs with corrosion -resistant, capable of desalination in acidic media, purifying heavy metal ion solutions through evaporation, as well as good mechanical properties for reusability. The study potentially provides a strategy for utilizing dopamine and CTAB loaded on high-performance polymer nanofibrous membranes and the convenient in -situ polymerization to generate advanced photothermal PANI. This strategy paves a way to enable high-performance engineering polymer, PEN, with solar -thermal evaporation capabilities, further opening its potential applications in seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification.

AB Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a prevalent cerebrovascular disorder. The inflammation induced by cerebral hemorrhage plays a crucial role in the secondary injury of ICH and often accompanied by a poor prognosis, leading to disease exacerbation. However, blood-brain barrier (BBB) limiting the penetration of therapeutic drugs to the brain. In this paper, our primary objective is to develop an innovative, non-invasive, safe, and targeted formulation. This novel approach aims to synergistically harness the combined therapeutic effects of drugs to intervene in inflammation via a non-injectable route, thereby significantly mitigating the secondary damage precipitated by inflammation following ICH. Thus, a novel "anti-inflammatory" cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) with targeting ability were constructed, which can enhance the stability of curcumin(CUR) and siRNA. We successfully developed SLN loaded with TGF-beta 1 siRNA and CUR (siRNA/CUR@SLN) that adhere to the requirements of drug delivery system by transnasal brain targeting. Through the characterization of nanoparticle properties, cytotoxicity assessment, in vitro pharmacological evaluation, and brain-targeting evaluation after nasal administration, siRNA/CUR@SLN exhibited a nearly spherical structure with a particle size of 125.0 +/- 1.93 nm, low cytotoxicity, high drug loading capacity, good sustained release function and good stability. In vitro anti-inflammatory results showcasing its remarkable anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, in vivo pharmacological studies revealed that siRNA/CUR@SLN can be successfully delivered to brain tissue. Furthermore, it also elicited an effective anti-inflammatory response, alleviating brain inflammation. These results indicated that favorable brain-targeting ability and anti-inflammatory effects of siRNA/CUR@SLN in ICH model mice. In conclusion, our designed siRNA/CUR@SLN showed good brain targeting and anti-inflammatory effect ability after nasal administration, which lays the foundation for the treatment of inflammation caused by ICH and offers a novel approach for brain-targeted drug delivery and brings new hope.

AB Antibiotics are widely used for treating bacterial infections. However, excessive or improper use of antibiotics can pose a serious threat to human health and water environments, and thus, developing cost-effective, portable and effective strategies to analyze and detect antibiotics is highly desired. Herein, we reported a responsive photonic hydrogel (RPH)-based optical biosensor (PPNAH) with superior recyclability for sensitive and colorimetric determination of a typical beta-lactam antibiotic penicillin G (PG) in water. This sensor was composed of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) smart hydrogel with incorporated penicillinase and Fe3O4@SiO2 colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs). The sensor could translate PG concentration signals into changes in the diffraction wavelength and structural color of the hydrogel. It possessed high sensitivity and selectivity to PG and excellent detection performances for other two typical beta-lactam antibiotics. Most importantly, due to the unique thermosensitivity of the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) moieties in the hydrogel, the PG-responded PPNAH sensor could be facilely regenerated via a simple physical method at least fifty times while without compromising its response performance. Besides, our sensor was suitable for monitoring the PG-contaminated environmental water and displayed satisfactory detection performances. Such a sensor possessed obvious advantages of superior recyclability, highly chemical stability, low production cost, easy fabrication, wide range of visual detection, simple and intuitive operation for PG detection, and environmental-friendliness, which holds great potential in sensitive and colorimetric detection of the PG residues in polluted water.

AB This work involves the sliding mode control (SMC) issue for a class of Markov jump singularly perturbed systems (MJSPSs) under consideration of unmatched external disturbances and communication constraints. For the first time, the piecewise homogeneous Markov chain (MC) which depends on the system mode and the controller mode is applied to control the scheduling of stochastic communication protocol (SCP), so that the MCs in the system models, the controller and the SCP constitute a three-layer nonstationary Markov model (NMM). This model perfectly describes the different objects of the three MCs and reflects the mutual regulation among them. The critical issue is to devise an adaptive controller and a sliding surface (SS) simultaneously under SCP scheduling. By applying a standard singular sliding mode surface, an appropriate nonstationary SMC law is established to promise the accessibility of the SS and the stability of the closed-loop system (CLS), and meet the expected performance indicator. Further, using the mode-dependent Lyapunov function and piecewise homogeneous Markov model method, sufficient criteria are obtained. The specific expression of the control gain is obtained by matrix decoupling technology. Finally, a numerical simulation is furnished to testify the correctness of the conclusion.

AB The intense bitterness of quercetin poses a challenge to its utilization in the food industry. To address this issue, three anionic polysaccharides (carrageenan, pectin, and trehalose) were individually incorporated to fabricate polysaccharide-coated liposome nanocarriers. Electronic tongue analysis revealed a significant decreasing bitterness value (10.34 +/- 0.07 mV, sensory score 1.8 +/- 0.2, taste weak bitter) in quercetin-loaded nanoliposomes, compared with the bitterness value of quercetin aqueous solution (14 +/- 0.01 mV, sensory score 7.3 +/- 0.3, taste strong bitter). Furthermore, the polysaccharide-coated nanoliposomes exhibited an even greater capacity to mask the bitterness of quercetin, with carrageenan coated nanoliposomes demonstrating the most pronounced effect. The superior bitter masking ability of carrageenan coated nanoliposomes can be attributed to its high charge and viscosity. In sensory evaluations, gummy incorporated with carrageenan-coated nanoliposomes received the highest ratings, exhibiting enhanced overall palatability and antioxidant activity. This study offers insights into expanding the use of bitter nutrients in food applications and paves the way for more appealing and healthful food products.

AB Exercise-induced fatigue (EF) is a common occurrence during prolonged endurance and excessive exercise and is mainly caused by energy depletion, harmful metabolite accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. EF usually leads to a reduction in initiating or maintaining spontaneous activities and muscle performance and ultimately results in a decrease in the quality of life of people who engage in physical work. Therefore, the interest in investigating EF-targeting agents with minimal side effects and good long-term efficacy has substantially increased. Natural edible and medicinal polysaccharides have shown positive anti-EF effects, but the relevant reviews are rare. This review comprehensively summarizes studies on natural polysaccharides from edible and medicinal sources that can relieve EF and improve physical performance from the past decade, focusing on their sources, monosaccharide compositions, anti-EF effects, and possible molecular mechanisms. Most of these anti-EF polysaccharides are heteropolysaccharides and are mainly composed of glucose, arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose, and mannose. In EF animal models, the polysaccharides exert positive EF-alleviating effects through energy supply, metabolic regulation, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and gut microbiota remodeling. However, further studies are still needed to clarify the anti-EF effects of these polysaccharides on human beings. In summary, the present review expects to provide scientific data for the future research and development of natural polysaccharide-based anti-EF drugs, dietary supplements, and health-care products for specific fatigue groups.

AB Palladium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most powerful and straightforward methods to forge a new C-H bond and a new C-X (X=C, N, O, F, Si etc) bond, which provides an efficient way to obtain valuable enantioenriched molecules from cheap and readily available feedstocks. Catalytic asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of simple alkenes is challenging but still highly sought after. This review will mainly focus on the recent advances in Palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of alkenes over the past decade, including hydroamination, hydrooxygenation, hydrofluorination, hydrosilylation, hydroarylation, hydroalkenylation and hydrocarbonylation.

AB Since low overpotential for the anodic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) can favor the higher output voltage and power of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), it is critical to design new EOR catalysts with efficient ethanol-to-CO2 activity at low applied potentials. Thereby, carbon-supported Ir-Bi2O3 (Ir-Bi2O3/C) catalysts with highly dispersive bismuth oxide on the iridium surface are designed and prepared, which can merit splitting the ethanol C-C bond and promoting the oxidation of C1 intermediates at the bifunctional interfaces. The as-obtained Ir-Bi2O3/C catalysts show superior EOR mass activity of up to ca. 2250 mA mg & DBLBOND;1 Ir . Moreover, they exhibit the record lowest onset oxidation potentials (0.17-0.22 V vs. RHE) and the peak potential (ca. 0.58 V vs. RHE), being 130-300 mV lower than the previous landmark noble metallic catalysts. Furthermore, an apparent C1 pathway faraday efficiency (FEC1) of 28% & PLUSMN; 5.9% at 0.5 V vs. RHE can be obtained at Ir-Bi2O3/C. This work might provide new insights into the new anodic EOR catalysts for increasing the power of DEFCs.& COPY; 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has been increasingly documented to cause negative impacts on mental health outcomes, e.g. posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Dispositional optimism ("optimism" hereinafter), a crucial psychological characteristic defined by positive expectancies for future outcomes, is considered to provide remarkable protection against PTSS. Accordingly, this study was designed to identify neuroanatomical signatures of optimism and further examine the mechanism through which optimism protects against COVID-19-specific PTSS. Here, 115 volunteers from a general population of university students completed MRI scans and optimism tests before (October 2019-January 2020) and after (February-April 2020) the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis showed that a region from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was associated with optimism. Further seed-based structural covariance network (SCN) analysis using partial least-squares correlation found an optimism-linked SCN covarying with the combined dACC and dmPFC (the dACC-dmPFC). Additionally, mediation analyses revealed that the dACC-dmPFC volume and its SCN impacted COVID-19-specific PTSS through optimism. Our findings deepen the understanding of optimism and have the potential to identify vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic or similar future events, as well as to guide optimism-related neural interventions to prevent and alleviate PTSS.

AB In recent years, the interest in cider produced from pear has considerably increased as a way to add value to fruits unsuitable for direct consumption or to valorize pear varieties grown in restricted regions. In the current study, with the China National Geographic Indication Products Guangan honey pear as raw material, four commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, namely RW, SY, DV10 and Drop Acid Yeast (DAY), were used to produce pear cider, comparing their taste characteristics and metabolomic profiles changes through the combination of GC-MS, 1H-NMR and E-tongue. The results showed that there was a clear classification from the data obtained ac-cording to different yeast strains fermented Guangan honey pear cider, represented by a high discrimination index. Several pathways were altered during fermentation due to the distinct yeast strains, namely arginine and proline metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, urea cycle, alanine metabolism, citric acid cycle, amino sugar metabolism, carnitine synthesis and warburg effect. This study could help improve the quality of Guangan honey pear cider by selecting different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts and, in turn, it could shed lights on the large-scale production of pear cider.

AB The yak has a unique physiological structure suited to life in anoxic and cold environments at high altitudes. The aim of this study was to isolate Bacillus species with good probiotic properties from yak feces. A series of tests were performed on the isolated Bacillus: 16S rRNA identification, antibacterial activity, tolerance to gastroenteric fluid, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, antibiotic sensitivity, growth performance, antioxidants, and immune indexes. A safe and harmless Bacillus pumilus DX24 strain with good survival rate, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, and antibacterial activity was identified in the yak feces. Feeding mice with Bacillus pumilus DX24 increased their daily weight gain, jejunal villus length, villi/Crypt ratio, blood IgG levels, and jejunum sIgA levels. This study confirmed the probiotic effects of Bacillus pumilus isolated from yak feces and provides the theoretical basis for the clinical application and development of new feed additives.

AB Simple Summary Dairy cows are commonly affected by mastitis, which causes huge economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide. This work aimed to study this disease by comparing multiple biological specimens (feces, serum, and urine) from individuals with or without clinical mastitis. Integrated analysis of metabolome changes across several key biofluids could facilitate knowledge discovery and reliable identification of potential biomarkers, which could in turn be used to shed light on the early diagnosis of dairy cow mastitis in its subclinical form. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dedicated to providing quantitative information on the multi-matrix metabolome of dairy cows with/without clinical mastitis by untargeted H-1-NMR. Several pathways related to energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism have been highlighted to explain the mechanisms of the changes in the dairy cow metabolome related to clinical mastitis. Our findings are the first to provide an integrated view and better understanding of the metabolic mechanism of clinical mastitis, useful for the development of regulated strategies to improve the metabolic status of mastitic dairy cows. Due to huge economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide, mastitis can be considered as one of the most common diseases in dairy cows. This work aimed to study this disease by comparing multiple biological specimens (feces, serum, and urine) from individuals with or without clinical mastitis. This was performed by a single analytical platform, namely H-1-NMR, through a multi-matrix strategy. Thanks to the high reproducibility of H-1-NMR, we could characterize 120 molecules across dairy cow feces, serum, and urine. Among them, 23 molecules were in common across the three biofluids. By integrating the results of multi-matrix metabolomics, several pathways pertaining to energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism appeared to be affected by clinical mastitis. The present work wished to deepen the understanding of dairy cow mastitis in its clinical form. Simultaneous analysis of metabolome changes across several key biofluids could facilitate knowledge discovery and the reliable identification of potential biomarkers, which could be, in turn, used to shed light on the early diagnosis of dairy cow mastitis in its subclinical form.

AB With the increasing oily wastewater discharges and crude oil leakage accidents, the eco-environment and human health is seriously harmed. Membrane technology is an ideal choice for industrial oil/water separation, but the gradually structural fouling has severely hampered the long-term practical applications. Herein, membrane separation, electroflotation and electro-Fenton technologies are successfully coupled through structural design and regulation. The FeOOH nanosheet/CuO nanowire coated on copper mesh is prepared via chemical oxidation and thermal dehydration. The FeOOH nanosheets are in situ converted and tightly encapsulated on the surface of CuO nanowires, while the hierarchical nano-array structure and interconnected FeOOH coating ensure the superhydrophilic, underwater superoleophobic and electroflotation self-cleaning capabilities. Therefore, the 3*Fe/CuO-5 membrane exhibits high water flux (>= 1400 L h-1 m-2), separation efficiency (>= 99.2%) and excellent electroflotation self-cleaning capability (within 2 min) in oil-in-water emulsion separation. Moreover, the heterogeneous electro-Fenton system composed of 3*Fe/CuO-5 membrane exhibits good degradation effi-ciency of 30 mg L-1 methylene blue within 100 min. Thus, the as-prepared 3*Fe/CuO-5 membrane is promising in industrial wastewater purification due to its rapid oil separation and soluble organic purification ability.

AB Exercise-induced fatigue is a common phenomenon caused by prolonged strenuous exercise and physical labor as a feeling of exhaustion and reduction of muscle performance, which seriously affects people's health, work efficiency and quality of life. Meanwhile, numerous studies have shown that natural flavonoids can be an excellent source for preventing and treating exercise-induced fatigue due to their extraordinary antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. However, the review of flavonoids in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue is still limited. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes recent studies on natural bioactive flavonoids that can alleviate exercise-induced fatigue and improve physical performance, including their plant sources, structure types and features, pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms against exercise-induced fatigue. Also, the clinical trials have also been reviewed. Flavonols, isoflavones, anthocyanins, and their corresponding glycosides are the major bioactive flavonoids in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue. The current data and the further molecular docking evidently support the potential anti-fatigue effects of these flavonoids mainly involving the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory response, as well as the regulation of energy metabolism. Activation of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE and AMPK/PGC1-alpha pathways are responsible for the improvement of flavonoids against exercise-induced fatigue. Hence, this review is expected to contribute to the further research and development of anti-fatigue flavonoids in the functional food and nutraceutical industry.

AB Nanocomposites play critical roles in catalytic oxidation, wastewater treatment, and other chemical engineering fields. Therefore, the strategies to develop multifunctional nanocomposite systems through chemical synthesis, physical doping, and assembly have been explored. The existing challenges including fussy preparation processes and conditions limit the applications of multifunctional nanocomposite systems. Here we nano-engineer a ver-satile polyphenolic functionalized magnetic core-satellite superstructure (referred to as PfMCSP) using the metal-phenolic mediated fast self-assembly in which Fe3O4 and polyphenolic functionalized TiO2 are used as the core and satellite, respectively. The PfMCSP presents a high equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) of 210.68 mg/g and achieves ultrafast adsorption (more than 89% of qe within 2 min) of organic dyes (methylene blue, rhodamine B, and toluidine blue) through multiple interactions. Moreover, the adsorption process accelerates the photo-catalysis (TiO2) and Fenton reaction (Fe3O4) synergistic to remove organic dyes, resulting in more than 95% degradation of methylene blue (160 mg/L) within 90 min and maintaining an 80% degradation after 5 recycles. This facile and rapid synthesis strategy for PfMCSP based on the encapsulation of Fe3O4, TiO2, and natural polyphenol, is envisaged to deliver a new path for practical wastewater treatment applications.

AB The spread of the highly virulent PEDV in many countries is still leading to several epidemic and endemic outbreaks. To elucidate effective antiviral mechanisms, it is important to study the relationship between host antiviral factors and the virus and to investigate the mechanisms underlying host immune response against PEDV infection.
   Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a re-emerging enteric coronavirus currently spreading in several nations and inflicting substantial financial damages on the swine industry. The currently available coronavirus vaccines do not provide adequate protection against the newly emerging viral strains. It is essential to study the relationship between host antiviral factors and the virus and to investigate the mechanisms underlying host immune response against PEDV infection. This study shows that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), the host protein determined by the transcription factor KLF15, inhibits the replication of PEDV by degrading the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PEDV in accordance with selective autophagy. hnRNP K was found to be capable of recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase, MARCH8, aiming to ubiquitinate N protein. Then, it was found that the ubiquitinated N protein could be delivered into autolysosomes for degradation by the cargo receptor NDP52, thereby inhibiting PEDV proliferation. Moreover, based on the enhanced MyD88 expression, we found that hnRNP K activated the interferon 1 (IFN-1) signaling pathway. Overall, the data obtained revealed a new mechanism of hnRNP K-mediated virus restriction wherein hnRNP K suppressed PEDV replication by degradation of viral N protein using the autophagic degradation pathway and by induction of IFN-1 production based on upregulation of MyD88 expression. IMPORTANCE The spread of the highly virulent PEDV in many countries is still leading to several epidemic and endemic outbreaks. To elucidate effective antiviral mechanisms, it is important to study the relationship between host antiviral factors and the virus and to investigate the mechanisms underlying host immune response against PEDV infection. In the work, we detected hnRNP K as a new host restriction factor which can hinder PEDV replication through degrading the nucleocapsid protein based on E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 and the cargo receptor NDP52. In addition, via the upregulation of MyD88 expression, hnRNP K could also activate the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. This study describes a previously unknown antiviral function of hnRNP K and offers a new vision toward host antiviral factors that regulate innate immune response as well as a protein degradation pathway against PEDV infection.

AB Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is an important pathogen of the bovine respiratory disease complex, invading lower respiratory tracts and causing severe pneumonia. However, its molecular mechanism largely remains unknown. Host annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein. The current study sought to determine whether ANXA2 could mediate M. bovis adhesion and invasion thereby affecting its induction of inflammatory response. ANXA2 expression was upregulated in M. bovis-infected bovine lung epithelial cells (EBL), and blocking ANXA2 with an anti-ANXA2 antibody reduced M. bovis adhesion to EBL. Compared with uninfected cells, more ANXA2 was translocated from the cytoplasm to the cell surface after M. bovis infection. Furthermore, RNA interference knockdown of ANXA2 expression in EBL cells resulted in a significant decrease in M. bovis invasion and F-actin polymerization. Next, the transcriptomic study of M. bovis-infected EBL cells with and without ANXA2 knockdown were performed. The data exhibited that ANXA2 knockdown EBL cells had 2487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 1175 upregulated and 1312 downregulated compared to control. According to GO and KEGG analyses, 50 genes potentially linked to inflammatory responses, 23 involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and 48 associated with PI3K-AKT signal pathways were upregulated, while 38 mRNA binding genes, 16 mRNA 3 '-UTR binding genes, and 34 RNA transport genes were downregulated. Furthermore, 19 genes with various change-folds were selected for qPCR verification, and the results agreed with the RNA-seq findings. Above all, the transcription of two chemokines (IL-8 and CXCL5) and a key bovine beta-defensin TAP in IL-17 signaling pathway were significantly increased in ANXA2 knockdown cells. Moreover, ANXA2 knockdown or knockout could increase NF-kappa B and MAPK phosphorylation activity in response to M. bovis infection. Additionally, ANXA2 knockdown also significantly decreased the CD44 transcripts via exon V3 and V7 skipping after M. bovis infection. We concluded that M. bovis borrowed host ANXA2 to mediate its adhesion and invasion thereby negatively regulating molecular expression essential to IL-17 signal pathway. Furthermore, CD44 V3 and V7 isoforms might contribute to this ANXA2 meditated processes in M. bovis infected EBL cells. These findings revealed a new understanding of pathogenesis for M. bovis infection.

AB Located on the southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Shaluli Mountains Region (SMR) is an important conservation priority area in Southwest China's highly biodiverse Hengduan Mountains. The SMR's ecology is complex and topographically diverse, with unique composition of abundant flora and fauna. Historically and currently a majority-Tibetan region, Tibetan Buddhism has significantly affected most local people's views on the natural environment. According to Tibetan religious theories and doctrines, the Shaluli Tibetans traditionally abstain from killing wild animals, believe in reincarnation (e.g., karmic cause and effect), the equality of all living beings, and the belief that everything has spirits. To understand how these beliefs and practices influenced the SMR's ecology and biodiversity, and how modernization pressures affect them, we conducted a three-year ethnobiological field investigation in seven SMR counties and a neighboring city. The traditional worldview in this relatively remote region has profoundly shaped the lifestyles, customs, and behavioral norms of the local religiously-observant Tibetans. These beliefs have influenced their perspective on the natural world, having an overall positive role in the long-term protection of the local ecological environment and biodiversity. As the surrounding regions have experienced increasing development and modernization pressures that threaten this biodiversity hotspot, Shaluli's Tibetan Buddhist temples and monks have assumed an active role promoting environmental protection, forest resource stewardship, and wildlife conservation. However, we found that modernization pressures and changing socio-economic conditions have negatively influenced these traditions, resulting in greater likelihood of biological invasions and pollution of the local soil and water sources.

AB This study examined the effect of physical exercise on the life satisfaction among college students. On the basis of the Basic Psychological Need Theory, the mediating roles of competence and relatedness needs satisfaction and their differences among college students in physical education (PE) majors and non-PE majors were explored. The sample included 1,012 college students who were selected to participate in an online survey. Major findings were as follows: (1) The total effect of physical exercise commitment on college students' life satisfaction was marginally significant while that of physical exercise adherence was not significant; (2) The effect of physical exercise commitment was observed exclusively through the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction, while that of physical exercise adherence was through both competence and relatedness needs satisfaction; (3) In terms of differences caused by major, only one mediation path, that was, physical exercise -> competence need satisfaction -> college students's life satisfaction was significant among PE majors. This study thus enriched the empirical research on the benefits of physical exercise to individual mental health, highlighted the particularity of college students majoring in PE, and provided targeted and sensible suggestions for the design of physical exercise intervention programs.

AB Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), as a typical chlorinated flame retardant, is attracting more attention as a carcinogen. Although persulfate-based oxidation exhibits good performance in removing refractory organic pollutants, the kinetics of persulfate-based remediation are affected by inorganic anions, which causes inaccurate remediation efficiency. This study combines steady-state radical concentration modelling with isotope fractionation to investigate the effects of inorganic anions on TCEP degradation by UV/persulfate (UV/PS). In the absence of anions during UV/ PS system, the observed degradation rate was (9.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-5) s(-1), which was approximately 93 % attributed to sulfate radical (SO4-.) oxidation based on radical modelling. Carbon isotope fractionation, coupled with the identification of transformation products by mass spectrometry, suggests a carbon bond split during TCEP degradation with a carbon isotopic fractionation value (epsilon) of -1.6 +/- 0.2%(+/- 95 % confidence intervals). With respect to co-existing anions in UV/PS system, the addition of chloride (Cl-) had a negligible effect on degradation rates, while the addition of hydrogencarbonate (HCO3-) caused them to decrease, and the addition of hydrogenphosphate (HPO42-) caused them to increase. Radical modelling suggested that SO4-.was transformed to chlorine radicals (Cl./Cl-2(-.)), phosphate radicals (HPO4-.), and carbonate radicals (CO3-.). Furthermore, the overlapping 95 % confidence intervals (C.I.) and the statistical tests (p > 0.05) both agree that Cl- and HPO42- - gain identical epsilon values. Nevertheless, when HCO(3)(-)coexisted in the UV/PS system, the e values were distinct. The addition of HCO3- would result in e variation of TCEP in the UV activated PS process, which should receive more attention when applying remediation.

AB Generation of construction and demolition waste (CDW) is a challenge for sustainable development. Recycling is required in response to energy consumption and natural resource depletion caused by CDW. Public-private partnership (PPP) mode provides a strategy for CDW recycling. This study aims to investigate the decision-making behaviours of the government and recyclers and propose management mechanisms to improve CDW recycling. Based on evolutionary game model, the influencing factors of stakeholders' behavioural strategies were identified, including the government supervision costs, penalty, subsidy, the benefits and costs of recyclers' cooperation and opportunism and consumers' purchase intention. The results revealed how the initial strategy proportions, penalties, subsidies and consumers' purchase intentions affect the evolutionary paths of stakeholders' decision-making behaviours in CDW recycling PPP projects. The larger the initial strategy value, the faster the evolutionary trajectory reaches ESS (0, 1). The penalty can restrain speculative behaviours of recyclers, whilst the subsidy has no significant effect. Consumer purchase intention can reduce the cost of government supervision and improve the cooperation efficiency of recyclers. These findings may contribute to enriching the body of knowledge in CDW and providing management mechanisms for CDW recycling practice. Appropriate penalty, subsidy and financial support policies should be formulated to promote the development of CDW recycling PPP projects.

AB Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the dominant limiting nutrients in alpine meadows, but it is relatively unclear how they affect the soil microbial community and whether their effects are rate dependent. Here, N and P addition rates (0, 10, 20, and 30 g m(-2) year(-1)) were evaluated in an alpine meadow and variables related to plants and soils were measured to determine the processes affecting soil microbial community and enzyme activities. Our results showed that soil microbial biomass, including bacteria, fungi, gramme-negative bacteria, and actinomycetes, decreased along with N addition rates, but they first decreased at low P addition rates (10 g m(-2) year(-1)) and then significantly increased at high P addition rates (30 g m(-2) year(-1)). Both the N and P addition stimulated soil invertase activity, while urease and phosphatase activities were inhibited at low N addition rate and then increased at high N addition rate. P addition generally inhibited peroxidase and urease activities, but increased phosphatase activity. N addition decreased soil pH and, thus, inhibited soil microbial microorganisms, while P addition effects were unimodal with addition rates, achieved through altering sedge, and available P in the soil. In conclusion, our studies indicated that soil microbial communities and enzyme activities are sensitive to short-term N and P addition and are also significantly influenced by their addition rates.

AB The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a hyper-polymorphic genomic region, which forms a part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system and is crucial for intra- and extra-cellular pathogen recognition (MHC-I and MHC-IIA/B, respectively). Although recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing methods sparked research on the MHC in non-model species, the evolutionary history of MHC gene structure is still poorly understood in birds. Here, to explore macroevolutionary patterns in the avian MHC architecture, we retrieved contigs with antigen-presenting MHC and MHC-related genes from available genomes based on third-generation sequencing. We identified: 1) an ancestral avian MHC architecture with compact size and tight linkage between MHC-I, MHC-IIA/IIB and MHC-related genes; 2) three major patterns of MHC-IIA/IIB unit organization in different avian lineages; and 3) lineage-specific gene translocation events (e.g., separation of the antigen-processing TAP genes from the MHC-I region in passerines), and 4) the presence of a single MHC-IIA gene copy in most taxa, showing evidence of strong purifying selection (low dN/dS ratio and low number of positively selected sites). Our study reveals long-term macroevolutionary patterns in the avian MHC architecture and provides the first evidence of important transitions in the genomic arrangement of the MHC region over the last 100 million years of bird evolution.

AB In order to describe the roadmap of current edge computing research activities, we first address a brief overview of the most advanced edge computing surveys published in the last six years. It is true that edge computing has been adaptively integrated into growing number of applications. Edge computing theory and technology will bring substantial innovation and incentive, as well as a large number of application scenarios in different fields, such as edge computing assisted smart city, Internet of Vehicles(IoV), Industrial Internet, and many other different fields. In the field of edge computing, however, it is actually lack of a comprehensive investigation of using the most advanced theoretical models, technologies, directions and development paths. To fill this gap, by identifying and classifying, we carry out an in-depth survey of the latest high-quality literatures related to the theoretical discoveries in edge computing(EC) and the fusion of EC and the frontiers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Finally, it is summarized several promising open issues, and also pointed forwards the directions of future research. We hope that this survey report will attract much more attention, stimulate fruitful discussions, and provide ideas and useful guidance for further research on the theoretical models, technologies, directions and development paths of edge computing.

AB Purpose: Mesangial cells-mediated glomerulonephritis refers to a category of immunologically mediated glomerular injuries characterized by infiltration of circulating inflammatory cells, proliferation of mesangial cells, and the common pathological manifestation to the later stage is renal fibrosis, accompanied by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Treatment regimens include glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, but their off-target distribution causes severe systemic toxicity. Hence, specific co-delivery of "anti-inflammatory/anti-fibrosis" drugs to the glomerular mesangial cell (MC) region is expected to produce better therapeutic effects. Methods: A novel kidney-targeted nanocarrier drug delivery system targeting MCs was constructed using passive targeting resulting from the difference in pore size between the glomerular endothelial layer and the basement membrane, and active targeting based on the specific binding of antibodies and antigens. Specifically, a liposome-nanoparticle hybrid (PLGA-LNHy) was formed by coating the surface of PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) with a phospholipid bilayer, and then PLGA-LNHy was co-modified with PEG and alpha 8 integrin antibodies to obtain PLGA immunoliposomes (PLGA-ILs). Results: The results showed that the obtained NPs had a core-shell structure, uniform and suitable particle size (119.1 +/- 2.31 nm), low cytotoxicity, and good mesangial cell-entry ability, which can successfully accumulate in the glomerular MC region. Both dexamethasone (DXMS) and captopril (CAP) were loaded onto PLGA-ILs with a drug loading of 10.22 +/- 1.00% for DXMS and 6.37 +/- 0.25% for CAP (DXMS/CAP@PLGA-ILs). In vivo pharmacodynamics showed that DXMS/CAP@PLGA-ILs can effectively improve the pathological changes in the mesangial area and positive expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in glomeruli as well as reduce the expression of inflammatory factors, fibrotic factors and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, renal inflammation and fibrosis were relieved. Conclusion: We have provided a strategy to increase nanoparticle accumulation in MCs with the potential to implement regulatory effects of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis in glomerulonephritis (GN).

AB Obesity is a global epidemic that affects the lives and health of millions of people. The prevention and treatment of obesity have become a significant public health challenge worldwide. Numerous studies showed that the gut microbiota is associ-ated with the development of obesity, and the regulatory mechanisms mediating the relationship between gut micro-biota and obesity have become an intense research area. Capsaicin is a vanilla amide alkaloid that is an active ingredient in pepper. Much research demonstrated the antiobesity activity of capsaicin. This article reviews recent research on the anti-obesity mechanisms of capsaicin involving alterations of the gut microbial composition, reduction of intestinal permeability, and regulation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. This summary will establish a basis for further developing capsaicin as an ingredient in medications and health products.

AB Green tea extract (GTE) is popular in weight loss, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is considered as the main active component. However, GTE is the primary cause of herbal and dietary supplement-induced liver injury in the United States. Whether there is a greater risk of liver injury when EGCG is consumed during dieting for weight loss has not been previously reported. This study found for the first time that EGCG could induce enhanced lipid metabolism pathways, suggesting that EGCG had the so-called "fat burning" effect, although EGCG did not cause liver injury at doses of 400 or 800 mg/kg in normal mice. Intriguingly, we found that EGCG caused dose-dependent hepatotoxicity on mice under dietary restriction, suggesting the potential combination effects of dietary restriction and EGCG. The combination effect between EGCG and dietary restriction led to overactivation of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid oxidation pathways, significantly increasing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites and thus mediating liver injury. We also found that the disruption of Lands' cycle and sphingomyelin-ceramides cycle and the high expression of taurine-conjugated bile acids were important metabolomic characteristics in EGCG-induced liver injury under dietary restriction. This original discovery suggests that people should not go on a diet while consuming EGCG for weight loss; otherwise the risk of liver injury will be significantly increased. This discovery provides new evidence for understanding the "drug-host" interaction hypothesis of drug hepatotoxicity and provides experimental reference for clinical safe use of green tea-related dietary supplements.

AB Fe-doped Ag-ZnO (Zn0.97FexAg0.03-xO) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a two-step polymer network gel method. By modulating the Fe, Ag concentration to acquire the strongest spectral absorption and the most efficient charge separation efficiency, the photocatalytic performance of ZnO for methylene blue (MB) degradation can be improved synergistically and remarkably. The spectral absorption and the photo-generated charge carrier separation properties of ZnO are enhanced by introducing Fe and Ag. The Fe2+ to Fe3+ valence state transformation is observed in the case of increasing Fe doping concentration. Especially, sample Zn0.97Fe0.005Ag0.025O (FZA-0.5) exhibits the strongest spectral absorption, the weakest photoluminescence (PL) emission, and displays the strongest surface photo-voltage (SPV) signal. Compared with pure ZnO, these favorable features of FZA-0.5 lead to the degradation efficiency of MB under UV and visible light being similar to 2.7 and similar to 5.0 times higher, respectively. Besides, the introduced Fe2+ on ZnO surface seems more beneficial for the photocatalytic enhancement. We show a strategy for synthesizing high performance and low-cost ZnO-based photocatalysts by trace transition metal doping to reduce the decoration of noble metal. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Theileriaspecies, with a broad geographic distribution, infect a wide range of both domestic and wild animals and are transmitted by ixodid ticks. Currently, there is no comprehensive report regarding the distribution ofTheileriaspp. in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, especially in Ganze Tibetan autonomous prefecture (153,700 km(2)) and Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture (84,242 km(2)) of Sichuan province, China. In this study, we collected blood samples from yaks (n = 144) (Bos grunniens), Tibetan sheep (n = 92), and Tibet horses (n = 142) in Ganze and Ngawa. Theileria sinensis,T. luwenshuni, andT. equiwere the dominantTheileriaspecies detected in yaks, Tibetan sheep, and horses with the total infection rates of 25.7% (37/144), 75.0% (69/92), and 51.4% (73/142), respectively. For ectoparasites,T. luwenshuniwas the onlyTheileriaspecies detected in sheep keds (Melophagus ovinus) with an infection rate of 30.8% (8/26). The total infection rates ofT. sinensisinHaemaphysalis qinghaiensis,Dermacentor everestianus, andRhipicephalus micropluswere 34.6% (36/104), 34.0% (17/50), and 51.3% (58/113), respectively.Theileriaspp., belonging toT. sergenti/buffeli/orientalisgroup, were only detected inR. micropluscollected in Danba county of Ganze with a total infection rate of 39.9% (19/48). Our results provide important data of the epidemiology ofTheileriaspp. in livestock and ectoparasites and will assist with the implementation of measures to control theileriosis transmission in eastern Tibetan Plateau, China.

AB Various payment for ecosystem services (PES) programmes are becoming very common across the globe due to ever-strengthening conservation policies and aspirations for socio-ecological sustainability. Nevertheless, quantifying the performance of PES at large spatial scales remains very challenging. Here, a biophysically-based indicator approach is formulated to assess the effectiveness of a new large-scale PES program in China. Structural equation modelling was also used to reveal the possible landscape features that might impact the effectiveness of the PES. The results suggested the overall effectiveness of the PES implementation, but the effectiveness suggested by the analysis tended to decrease with increasingly fine spatial scales from the whole PES implementing region down to 100 km(2) grids. The selected landscape features combined to explain 27% of the variability in the effectiveness of the PES programme. The spatial scale and landscape dependency of the effectiveness of PES could provide new insight to support the planning and adaptive management of large PES programmes.

AB Dandelion flower-like micelles (DFMs) were prepared by self-assembly of polycaprolactone (PCL) functionalized surface cross-linked micelles (SCMs). Upon reductive stimuli, the SCMs can be released from the DFMs by non-Brownian motion at an average speed of 19.09 mu m s(-1). Similar to the property of dandelion flowers dispersing their seeds over a long distance, the DFMs demonstrated enhanced multicellular tumor spheroid (MTS) penetration, a useful property in the treatment of many diseases including cancer, infection-of-biofilm diseases and ocular problems.

AB A UV-activated room temperature chemiresistive gas sensor based on ZnO nanocrystals film was fabricated. Its gas sensing properties under various conditions were also investigated in detail. The results shed new insight into the adsorption behaviors of gas molecules on the surface of ZnO nanocrystals under UV irradiation. The chemisorbed oxygen species (O2(ads)-(hv)) induced by UV light govern the adsorption and desorption ways of other gas molecules on the surface of ZnO nanocrystals, which is dependent on the electron affinity of gas molecules. Gas molecules with higher electron affinity than oxygen molecules can be adsorbed on the surface by the competitive adsorption way, extracting electrons from the surface. Gas molecules with lower electron affinity than oxygen molecules are attracted by the adsorbed O2(ads)-(hv) layer, releasing electrons to the surface. These processes can influence the gas sensing properties of the sensor. Our findings will pave the way for the fundamental understanding and design of UV-activated gas sensor in the future.

TI A hierarchical clustering algorithm based on noise removal

DE Hierarchical clustering; Natural neighbor; Noise removal
AB Noise is irrelevant or meaningless data and hinders most types of data analysis. The existing clustering algorithms seldom take the noise points into consideration and cannot detect arbitrary-shaped clusters. This paper presents a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm Based on Noise Removal (HCBNR). It is robust against noise points and good at discovering clusters with arbitrary shapes. In this work, natural neighbor-based density is applied to remove noise points in a data set firstly. Then we construct a saturated neighbor graph on the rest points, and a novel modularity-based graph partitioning algorithm is used to divide the graph into small clusters. Finally, the small clusters are repeatedly merged according to a novel similarity metric between clusters until the desired cluster number is obtained. The experimental results on synthetic data sets and real data sets show that our method can accurately identify noise points and obtain better clustering results than existing clustering algorithms when discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters.

AB Carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an important variable in carbon cycling and a key parameter in biogeochemical models, which is expected to increase with N availability. However, how CUE changes with N input rate remains elusive and lacks field evidence. We implemented a field manipulative experiment to examine effects of N addition with six levels of rate (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 g.N.m(-2).year(-1)) on canopy CUE (the ratio of net primary productivity [NPP] to gross primary productivity [GPP]) and ecosystem CUE (the ratio of net ecosystem productivity [NEP] to GPP) in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau in 2014-2016. Over the 3 years, nitrogen addition treatments did not change canopy CUE or ecosystem CUE in comparing with the control, although it significantly increased GPP, NPP, and NEP; those components of CUE had the same response patterns to N addition rates, which shifted from linear responses in the first year to saturation responses thereafter. Moreover, GPP showed a positive linear relationship with NEP, NPP, ecosystem respiration, and autotrophic respiration under each N addition treatment with no changes in slope. The inherent coupling between GPP and ecosystem respiration, as well as GPP and autotrophic respiration, made CUE less sensitive to N addition than carbon fluxes themselves. The conclusions challenge the widely held hypothesis that ecosystem CUE increases with N addition. This study provides the first empirical evidences on the proposition that CUE is insensitive to N availability, which is of importance in model construction and parameterization.

AB Memory is an important factor on the evolution of cooperation in spatial structure. For evolutionary biologists, the problem is often how cooperation acts can emerge in an evolving system. In the case of snowdrift game, it is found that memory can boost cooperation level for large cost-to-benefit ratio r, while inhibit cooperation for small r. Thus, how to enlarge the range of r for the purpose of enhancing cooperation becomes a hot issue recently. This paper addresses a new memory-based approach and its core lies in: Each agent applies the given rule to compare its own historical payoffs in a certain memory size, and take the obtained maximal one as virtual payoff. In order to get the optimal strategy, each agent randomly selects one of its neighbours to compare their virtual payoffs, which can lead to the optimal strategy. Both constant-size memory and size-varying memory are investigated by means of a scenario of asynchronous updating algorithm on regular lattices with different sizes. Simulation results show that this approach effectively enhances cooperation level in spatial structure and makes the high cooperation level simultaneously emerge for both small and large r. Moreover, it is discovered that population sizes have a significant influence on the effects of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic resistance profiles and staphylococcal enterotoxins/enterotoxin-likes genes (se/sel) of Staphylococcus aureus from food. About 93 S. aureus strains were screened and 43 strains harbored se/sel genes, which were from raw meat, pickles, cooked meat, egg products, bean products, aquatic products, grains and fresh vegetables, respectively. Among the 21 se/sel genes, selx gene was found in 30/93 (32.26%) strains, followed by seb, ser, sea, sec, selp, sell and set. About 50/93 strains carried 10 antibiotic resistance genes. The prevalence rate of norA, chlA and grlA genes was relatively high, followed by ermC, tetA, aac6'/aph2, ermB, tetM, msrA and blaZ. Sixty-two strains of the 93 S. aureus isolates (62/93, 66.67%) were multidrug-resistant (3 antimicrobial agents). RESUMENEl presente estudio se oriento a investigar los perfiles de resistencia a los antibioticos y los genes de enterotoxinas estafilococicas y de aquellos parecidos a enterotoxinas (se/sel) de S. aureus aislada de alimentos. Con este objetivo se cribaron 93 cepas de S. aureus, 43 de las cuales albergaban genes se/sel, procedentes de carne cruda, pepinillos, carne cocida, productos de huevo, productos de frijol, productos acuaticos, granos y verduras frescas. En 30 de las 93 cepas (32,26%) se encontro el gen selx entre los 21 genes se/sel y, en orden descendente, los genes seb, ser, sea, sec, selp, sell y set. Asimismo, se constato que 50 de las 93 cepas albergaban 10 genes de resistencia a los antibioticos. La tasa de prevalencia de los genes norA, chlA y grlA fue relativamente elevada siguiendole, en orden descendente, las de los genes ermC, tetA, aac6'/aph2, ermB, tetM, msrA y blaZ. De las 93 cepas de S. aureus aisladas (62/93, 66,67%) 62 son resistentes a diversos medicamentos (tres agentes antimicrobianos).

AB A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically review the risk of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) in patients with cancer. The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with VEGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published till May 2017. Twenty-one RCTs and 9552 patients were included. The current analysis suggested that the use of VEGFR-TKIs increased the risk of all-grade HFSR (7.04;95%CI, 5.33-9.30;p < 0.00001) and high-grade (>= grade 3) HFSR (21.62;95%CI, 15.19-30.78;p < 0.00001). On subgroup analyses, the risk ratio (RR) of all-grade HFSR varies significantly according to cancer type, whereas the RR of high-grade HFSR did not. The risk of all-grade and high-grade HFSR did not affect by drug types, treatment line, median age and treatment duration.

AB This study constructs and investigates the non-fragile asynchronous H-infinity control for uncertain stochastic memory systems with Bernoulli distribution. The system not only contains the randomly occurring uncertainties of all parameters (ROUAPs) and stochastic disturbances in the system model, but also includes randomly gain perturbations in the controller. By introducing the stochastic variables, a new model structure is built obeying Bernoulli distribution to describe the system and the controller. Moreover, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovsldi function (LKF) is constructed, combining Ito's differential formula and free-weighting matrix method, less conservative results are presented in terms of the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, an observer-based non-fragile asynchronous H-infinity controller is designed without any limits on the system parameters. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Phytochemical investigation of the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the bark of Madagascan endemic and medicinal plant Cinnamosma fragrans led to the isolation of two drimane sesquiterpene derivatives: cinnafragroside A (1) and cinnafragrin E (2), two aromatic glycosides: 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenol 1-O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl-1-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), together with 12 known compounds identified as: helicide (6), 1-(alpha-L-rhamnosyl(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzene (7), vanilloloside (8), cinnamadin (9), ugandensolide (10), cinnamosmolide (11), cinnamolide (12), polygodial (13), cinnamodial (14), bemadienolide (15), 4-isopropyl-6-methyl-alpha-tetralone (16), and capsicodendrin (17). Another new compound, 11-norcinnafragrolide-9-one (5), was obtained during chemical derivatization of capsicodendrin and gave a hint to understanding the structure required for the antiproliferative activity of 17. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated based on the interpretation of their spectroscopic data including one and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (1D- and 2D-NMR) and mass spectroscopic data. All isolated compounds were evaluated against the hormone dependent breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Compound 17 exhibited the most potent activity with an IC50 value of 0.6 mu M. Our preliminary SAR study showed that the hydroxyl group at C-12' and the presence of conjugated carbonyl contribute to the antiproliferative activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Genipin is an ideal cross-linking agent in biomedical applications, which can undergo ring-opening polymerization in alkaline condition. The polygenipin can create short-range and long-range intermolecular cross-linking between protein chains. In this article, the polygenipin with different degree of polymerization was successfully prepared and used to fix gelatin composite materials. The short-range and long-range cross-linking effects of polygenipin were systematically studied. The results show that the composite materials present porous structure with tunable pore sizes in the gel state, which can be easily controlled by adjusting the degree of polymerization of polygenipin. Long-range cross-linking can increase the pore size of the gel. However, during the drying process, the composite films cross-linked by polygenipin with higher degree of polymerization shrank to smaller size to create more compact structure, resulting in the improvement of water resistance properties, thermal stability, tensile strength, and darker color for the composite films. It is interesting that the composite films can partly swell to the original gel structure when in contact with water and saturated water vapor. All the composite films have excellent barrier properties against UV light. However, the compatibility of gelatin and polygenipin is reduced when the degree of polymerization of polygenipin increases to a certain extent, which will result in the formation of phase separation structure. The obtained composite films are ideal candidates for food and pharmaceutical packaging materials. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Rabbit coccidiosis, caused by infection of Eimeria spp. is one of the most severe parasitic diseases in rabbits. Eimeria intestinalis is one of the most immunogenic species in rabbit coccidia. Due to the lack of genomic information and unsuccessful in vitro cultivation, genetic manipulation of rabbit coccidia lagged behind other apicomplexan parasites. Using regulatory sequences from E tenella, we obtained a transgenic line of E. intestinalis expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). YFP was continuously expressed throughout the whole life cycle. Morphological features of E. intestinalis in different developmental stages were dynamically observed with the transgenic line. Some important features in the endogenous development stages were observed. Trophozoites were found as early as 4 h post inoculation. Two types of schizonts and merozoites were observed in first three of the four schizogonies. Beside jejunum and ileum, gametogony stage and oocysts were also found in the duodenum and vermiform appendix. In addition, the transgenic strain was highly immunogenic but less pathogenic than the wild type. Considering the high immunogenicity of E. intestinalis and amenability to transfection with foreign genes, transgenic E. intestinalis could be a promising oral eukaryotic vaccine vector.

DE Huperzine A; p65; astrocyte; Alzheimer's disease
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Its pathology often accompanies inflammatory action, and astrocytes play important roles in such procedure. Rela(p65) is one of significant message factors in NF-B pathway which has been reported high expression in astrocyte treated by A. HupA, an alkaloid isolated from Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, has been widely used to treat AD and observations reflected that it improves memory and cognitive capacity of AD patients. To reveal its molecular mechanisms on p65, we cultured astrocytes, built A-induced AD model, treated astrocytes with HupA at different concentrations, assayed cell viability with MTT, and detected p65 expression by immunohistochemistry and PCR. Our results revealed that treatment with 10M A1-42 for 24h induced a significant increase of NF-B in astrocytes; HupA significantly down-regulated p65 expression induced by A in astrocytes. This study infers that HupA can regulate NF-B pathway to treat AD.

AB OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to investigate the association of the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism with the effects of the exercise and dietary intervention on obese adolescents and children in China.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Total 138 chinese children and adolescents (77 males and 61 females, aged 10-18 years) were recruited in the 2012 summer camp in Shanghai. Dietary and exercise intervention was performed for four weeks. Obesity related parameters were detected by the physical examination before and after four-week's intervention. Genotyping of the FTO rs9939609 was performed by using a TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. SPSS 19.0 were used to do the statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: Finally, 135 campers were investigated in this study. The AA, AT and TT genotype frequencies of rs9939609 were 5.2%, 33.3% and 61.5%, respectively. The BMI in individuals with the genotype AA (or AT) was significantly higher compared with their with TT genotype (p = 0.044). The levels of body mass index (BMI), insulin (INS), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), red blood cell (RBC), Hemoglobin (HB) and hematocrit (HCT) in campers were significantly declined by the combined intervention (p < 0.05). Moreover, the levels of TC, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), RBC, HB, and HCT in the camper with genotype AA (or AT) were significantly decreased by the combined intervention compared with the camper with genotype TT (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The effects of exercise combined with dietary intervention on obesity were associated with the FTO rs9939609 polymorphism in chinese adolescents and children.

AB Overgrazing and climate change strongly affect alpine meadows by decreasing the plant community biomass and deteriorating the soil environment. To understand how the plant community and soil microbial community structure respond to grazing and N deposition, we conducted an experiment to remove or maintain the plant litter under the chronic addition of N in the Haibei Alpine Meadow in 2005. The experiment included four treatments: added N (+N, 20 g m(-2)) with the litter removed (LR), +N with the litter left intact (LI), LI without N addition (N), and LR with N. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm, and the following parameters were measured: 1) aboveground biomass (AGB) and litter biomass and 2) microbial community composition and content. Overall, the AGB and litter biomass significantly increased by 45.85% and 50.42% in response to N addition, whereas litter removal increased the AGB by 52.96%. The addition of urea N significantly decreased the PLFA content of the bacterial, gram-positive (G(+)), gram-negative (G(-)) at a soil of 0-10 cm in the LI and LR treatments by 64.87%, 61.82%, 76.07% and 64.86%, 53.02%, 51.44%, respectively. However, the PLFA content of the bacterial increased from 37.09 to 53.54 nmol g(-1) and from 37.09 to 62.05 nmol g(-1) at a depth of 10-20 cm for the +N + LI and +N + LR treatments compare to the LR+(-)N treatment, respectively. In addition, the total PLFAs in the LR+(-)N treatment significantly increased by 50.61% at a depth of 0-10 cm but decreased from 121.62 to 4231 nmol g(-1) at a depth of 10-20 cm relative to the LI+(-)N treatment. Using PLFA as a biomarker, we detected that G(-) bacteria and total PLFA generally increased with increasing soil depth in the +N plots. However, the content of G(-) was the highest at a depth of 0-10 cm and the lowest at a depth of 10-20 cm in the LR plots. The modification of soil microbial biomass at a depth of 0-10 cm was induced by the bottom-up effect of changes in soil nutrient contents and using ability, which were driven by N addition and litter manipulation. Thus, different soil depths with different soil nutrient conditions resulted in a strong microbial community composition gradient. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB We designed and synthesized a triarm star-shaped rod-rod block copolymer (BCP), (poly{2,5-bis[(4-methoxyphenyl)-oxycarbonyl] styrene}-block-poly(gamma-benzyl-(L)-glutamate))(3), (PMPCS-b-PBLG)(3). The triarm core with three PMPCS-N-3 segments was prepared by copper-mediated atom transfer radical polymerization of 2,5-bis[(4-methoxyphenyl)-oxycarbonyl] styrene initiated by a trifunctional initiator and a subsequent azide reaction. And the PBLG block with alkyne functionality was synthesized through ring-opening polymerization of gamma-benzyl-(L)-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride initiated by propargylamine. Finally, Huisgen's 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was employed to combine the triarm (PMPCS-N-3)(3) and PBLG segments. The chemical structure of the BCP was confirmed by H-1-NMR spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatographic analysis. Results from differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscopy, one-dimensional and two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy techniques demonstrate that the triarm star-shaped rod-rod BCP self-assembles into a hexagon-in-lamella morphology, with the PMPCS block in the columnar nematic phase and the PBLG block in the hexagonal columnar arrangement packed in bilayers due to the rigid nature of the two blocks and the covalent connections in the star-shaped BCP.

AB Background: Hyperlipidemia is thought to be a major risk factor for the progression of renal diseases in diabetes. Recent studies have shown that lipid profiles are commonly abnormal early on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with diabetic nephropathy. However, the early effects of triglyceride and cholesterol abnormalities on renal injury in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are not fully understood and require reliable animal models for exploration of the underlying mechanisms. Hamster models are important tools for studying lipid metabolism because of their similarity to humans in terms of lipid utilization and high susceptibility to dietary cholesterol and fat.
   Methods: Twenty-four male Golden Syrian hamsters (100-110 g) were rendered diabetes by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ) on consecutive 3 days at dose of 30 mg/kg, Ten days after STZ injections, hamsters with a plasma Glu concentration more than 12 mmol/L were selected as insulin deficient ones and divided into four groups (D-C, D-HF, D-HC, and D-HFHC), and fed with commercially available standard rodent chow, high-fat diet, high-cholesterol diet, high-fat and cholesterol diet respectively, for a period of four weeks.
   Results: After an induction phase, a stable model of renal injury was established with the aspects of early T1DM kidney disease, These aspects were severe hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, proteinuria with mesangial matrix accumulation, upgraded creatinine clearance, significant cholesterol and triglyceride deposition, and increasing glomerular surface area, thickness of basement membrane and mesangial expansion. The mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, transforming growth factors-beta, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in the D-HFHC group were significantly up-regulated compared with control groups.
   Conclusions: This study presents a novel, non-transgenic, non-surgical method for induction of renal injury in hamsters, which is an important complement to existing diabetic models for pathophysiological studies in early acute and chronic kidney disease, especially hyperlipidemia. These data suggest that both severe hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia can accelerate renal injury in the early development of T1DM.

AB The quantitative analysis of explosives is very important for national defence and security inspection. However, conventional analytical methods are complicated and time-consuming because of the complexity of the explosive samples. Herein, we proposed a new quantitative method, which combined ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry with partial least squares regression (PLS-1 and PLS-2), to quickly determine the content of 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetraazacyclo-octane (HMX), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) simultaneously from mixed explosive samples. The calibration models were constructed by using 49 reference samples in the calibration set and optimized by full cross-validation. The predictive performance of the optimized models was validated by 21 explosive samples in an independent test set. The standard errors of prediction (SEP) were lower than 1.4 mu g mL(-1) for HMX, 2.2 mu g mL(-1) for RDX, and 0.8 mu g mL(-1) for TNT in both PLS models. Finally, the optimized PLS-1 and PLS-2 models were successfully applied to simultaneously determine the three explosive ingredients in eight polymer bonded explosives (PBXs). The average recovery was close to 100% for each of the three components. Thus, UV spectrophotometry combined with PLS regression can be considered as a promising strategy to conduct the determination of HMX, RDX and TNT in practice.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. To date, many studies of PD have focused on its cardinal motor symptoms. To study the nonmotor signs of early PD, we investigated the reactions solicited by heat pain stimuli in early untreated PD patients without pain using fMRI. The activation patterns of contact heat stimuli (51 degrees C) were assessed in 14 patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with PD showed significant decreases in activation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and insula compared with controls. In addition, a significant relationship between activation of the insula and STG and the pain scores was observed in healthy controls but not in PD. This study provided further support that the insula and STG are important parts of the somatosensory circuitry recruited during the period of pain. The hypoactivity of the STG and insula in PD implied that functions including affective, cognitive, and sensory-discriminative processes, which are associated with the insula and STG, were disturbed. This finding supports the view that leaving early PD untreated could be tied directly to central nervous system dysfunction.

AB Chronic wounds are a serious complication for diabetic patients, causing substantial inconvenience and significant economic burden to patients, due to their characteristics of sequential development encountering bacterial infections, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammation and M1 macrophage accumulation. Herein, we developed a chronological adaptive Fe-based polyoxometalate on hyaluronic acid (Fe-POM@HA) hydrogel for diabetic chronic wounds, whose capacity can be strengthened by synergistic the acid-activated and glutathione-enhanced NIR-II photothermal therapy and achieving spatiotemporal selective and adaptive inhibition of bacterial infection. During the bacteria-infection slightly acidic stage, Fe-POM catalyzes endogenous H2O2 2 O 2 for ROS generation inducing bacterial ferroptosis, suppressing glutathione peroxidase activity, and promoting lipid peroxidation to disrupt the bacterial biofilm. As the wound transitions to neutral inflammation stage, Fe-POM with Fe2+/Mo5+ 2 + /Mo 5 + mixed valences can simultaneously alleviate oxidative stress and overcome the hypoxia microenvironment by continuously scavenging excessive ROS for endogenous H2O2 2 O 2 cyclic accumulation and O2 2 sustainable replenishment. Importantly, the Fe-POM@HA hydrogel could further promote wound angiogenesis at the new tissue proliferation stage through the immunomodulation of macrophage polarization and inflammatory factor expression. Therefore, Fe-POM@HA hydrogel provides a promising chronologically adaptive protocol for the repair and regeneration of chronic cutaneous wounds addressing complex clinical demands.

AB A small electrocaloric effect (ECE) is usually observed in aliovalent doped ferroelectric ceramics since decreased polarization is usually present. In this work, the high ECE is achieved in a barium titanate [BaTiO 3 (BT)]-based ceramic by introducing defect polarization to enhance the ferroelectric polarization and polarization change. The defect dipoles consisting of donor ion and barium vacancy, or barium and oxygen vacancies were formed in samarium-doped (Ba 1- 1.5 x Sm x )TiO 3 ceramics. The phase and defect structures, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are analyzed to confirm the evolution of charge compensation states and defect structures, and the influences of defects on polarization rotation and ECE. An enhanced ferroelectric polarization and high internal bias field are present in the ceramic with a suitable defect dipole effect, leading to a high polarization change before/after applying an electric field, causing an enhanced ECE. Finally, a high electrocaloric temperature change of -1.11 K and a large electrocaloric strength of -0.037 K & sdot; cm kV -1 were achieved under a low electric field of 30 kV/cm, indicating that forming suitable defect dipoles can optimize the ECE. This work provides a significant paradigm for tuning ECE in ferroelectric materials via defect regulation.

AB Zearalenone (ZEN, a widespread fusarium mycotoxin) causes evoked oxidative stress in reproductive system, but little is known about whether this is involved in ferroptosis. Melatonin, a well-known antioxidant, has demonstrated unique anti-antioxidant properties in several studies. Here, this study was aimed to investigate whether ZEN-induced oxidative stress in female pig's reproductive system was involved in ferroptosis, and melatonin was then supplemented to protect against ZEN-induced abnormalities in vitro cell models [human granulosa cell (KGN) and mouse endometrial stromal cell (mEC)] and in vivo mouse model. According to the results from female pig's reproductive organs, ZEN-induced abnormalities in vulvar swelling, inflammatory invasion and pathological mitochondria, were closely linked with evoked oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we further revealed that ZEN-induced reproductive toxicity was due to activated ferroptosis. Mechanistically, by using in vitro cell models (KGN and mEC) and in vivo mouse model, we observed that ZEN exposure resulted in oxidative stress and ferroptosis in a glutathione-dependent manner. Notably, these ZEN-induced abnormalities above were alleviated by melatonin supplementation through enhanced productions of glutathione peroxidase 4 and glutathione. Herein, the present results suggest that potential strategies to improve glutathione production protect against ZEN-induced reproductive toxicity, including oxidative stress and ferroptosis.

AB Climate warming, often accompanied by extreme drought events, could have profound effects on both plant community structure and ecosystem functioning. However, how warming interacts with extreme drought to affect community- and ecosystem-level stability remains a largely open question. Using data from a manipulative experiment with three warming treatments in an alpine meadow that experienced one extreme drought event, we investigated how warming modulates resistance and recovery of community structural and ecosystem functional stability in facing with extreme drought. We found warming decreased resistance and recovery of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and structural resistance but increased resistance and recovery of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), overall net primary productivity (NPP), and structural recovery. The findings highlight the importance of jointly considering above- and belowground processes when evaluating ecosystem stability under global warming and extreme climate events. The stability of dominant species, rather than species richness and species asynchrony, was identified as a key predictor of ecosystem functional resistance and recovery, except for BNPP recovery. In addition, structural resistance of common species contributed strongly to the resistance changes in BNPP and NPP. Importantly, community structural resistance and recovery dominated the resistance and recovery of BNPP and NPP, but not for ANPP, suggesting the different mechanisms underlie the maintenance of stability of above- versus belowground productivity. This study is among the first to explain that warming modulates ecosystem stability in the face of extreme drought and lay stress on the need to investigate ecological stability at the community level for a more mechanistic understanding of ecosystem stability in response to climate extremes.

AB In this study, double cross-linked egg yolk granules (EYGs)/sodium alginate (SA) emulsion gel was constructed and used as butter substitute. The water binding capacity, rheology properties and microstructure of EYGs/SA emulsion gel showed that the network structure tended to be complete when the concentration of SA reached 1% (m/v). SA stabilized the EYGs/SA droplets and enhanced the spatial network structure of emulsion gel. After substitution for butter, the network structure of EYGs/SA emulsion gel with more water bounded and the polyhydroxy structure of SA molecules endowed dough with more water retention capacity. Meanwhile, the destruction of the microstructure of the replaced dough with EYGs/SA emulsion gel was significantly inhibited compared with the un-substituted dough after freezing. The baking ability results showed a satisfactory baking effect after substitution. Overall, this study provides a new avenue in the field of fat replacement and the application of EYGs/SA emulsion gels.

AB The topic of how cooperation emerges and develops in the real world has been intensively studied. Many mechanisms and models have been proposed to explain this complex phenomenon with the idealized assumption that all players are homogeneous or have little heterogeneity. This paper investigates the evolution of the public goods game with multiple heterogeneities. Roughly speaking, the quantity of investment (by a cooperator), penalty (received by a defector), or cost (paid by a punisher) is not fixed but depends on specific evolutionary situation. Moreover, heterogeneity is also introduced in aspiration payoff of each player for the strategy updating rule. Multi-heterogeneity makes the considered model more realistic. The simulation experiment shows that the combination of modified punishment mechanism and strategy updating rule can promote cooperation density in both the multi-heterogeneity and homogeneity models.

AB Based on recent multiregional epidemiological investigations of Monkeypox (MPX), on 24 July 2022, the World Health Organization declared it a global public health threat. Retrospectively MPX was an ignored zoonotic endemic infection to tropical rainforest regions of Western and Central African rural communities until a worldwide epidemic in May 2022 verified the potential threat of monkeypox virus (MPXV) to be propagated across the contemporary world via transnational tourism and animal movements. During 2018-2022, different cases of MPX diagnosed in Nigerian travelers have been documented in Israel, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and the United States. More recently, on 27 September 2022, 66,000 MPX cases have been confirmed in more than 100 non-endemic countries, with fluctuating epidemiological footprinting from retrospective epidemics. Particular disease-associated risk factors fluctuate among different epidemics. The unpredicted appearance of MPX in non-endemic regions suggests some invisible transmission dynamic. Hence, broad-minded and vigilant epidemiological attention to the current MPX epidemic is mandatory. Therefore, this review was compiled to highlight the epidemiological dynamic, global host ranges, and associated risk factors of MPX, concentrating on its epidemic potential and global public health threat.

AB BackgroundThe identification and enumeration of medicinal plants at high elevations is an important part of accurate yield calculations. However, the current assessment of medicinal plant reserves continues to rely on field sampling surveys, which are cumbersome and time-consuming. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and deep learning (DL) have provided ultrahigh-resolution imagery and high-accuracy object recognition techniques, respectively, providing an excellent opportunity to improve the current manual surveying of plants. However, accurate segmentation of individual plants from drone images remains a significant challenge due to the large variation in size, geometry, and distribution of medicinal plants.ResultsIn this study, we proposed a new pipeline for wild medicinal plant detection and yield assessment based on UAV and DL that was specifically designed for detecting wild medicinal plants in an orthomosaic. We used a drone to collect panoramic images of Lamioplomis rotata Kudo (LR) in high-altitude areas. Then, we annotated and cropped these images into equally sized sub-images and used a DL model Mask R-CNN for object detection and segmentation of LR. Finally, on the basis of the segmentation results, we accurately counted the number and yield of LRs. The results showed that the Mask R-CNN model based on the ResNet-101 backbone network was superior to ResNet-50 in all evaluation indicators. The average identification precision of LR by Mask R-CNN based on the ResNet-101 backbone network was 89.34%, while that of ResNet-50 was 88.32%. The cross-validation results showed that the average accuracy of ResNet-101 was 78.73%, while that of ResNet-50 was 71.25%. According to the orthomosaic, the average number and yield of LR in the two sample sites were 19,376 plants and 57.93 kg and 19,129 plants and 73.5 kg respectively.ConclusionsThe combination of DL and UAV remote sensing reveals significant promise in medicinal plant detection, counting, and yield prediction, which will benefit the monitoring of their populations for conservation assessment and management, among other applications.

AB The single-component Ca9La(VO4)7:Dy3+, Gd3+ and Ca9La(VO4)7:Dy3+, Al3+ white-emitting phosphors were prepared through a solid-state method, and the Gd3+/Al3+ was introduced in the structure for photoluminescence enhancement. The XRD results verified that the structure of samples was consistent with the Ca9La (VO4)7 standard phase. The as-prepared Ca9La(VO4)7:Dy3+ exhibited a characteristic white emission consisting of a yellow peak (570 nm) and a blue peak (478 nm), which originated from the electron transitions 4F9/2-)6H13/ 2 and 4F9/2-)6H15/2 of Dy3+, respectively. Through the introduction of Gd3+/Al3+ into Ca9La(VO4)7:Dy3+, the luminescence intensity could be enhanced by 1.520 and 1.522 times, respectively, which are due to the crystalfield environmental effect. By combining the Ca9La0.79(VO4)7:0.18Dy3+, 0.03Gd3+ and Ca9La0.82(VO4)6.97:0.18Dy3+, 0.03Al3+ with a n-UV LED chip (lambda ex = 365 nm), the warm w-LEDs with suitable CCT and CRI values were realized. In summary, the Gd3+/Al3+ introduced Ca9La(VO4)7:Dy3+ samples can serve as excellent white-emitting phosphors for white-light-emitting diode applications.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb. (TB) is a traditional Tibetan medicine used to treat hepatobiliary diseases. However, modern pharmacological evidence of the activities and potential mech-anisms of TB against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still unknown.Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-NAFLD effect of ethanol extract of TB (ETB) and inves-tigate whether its ameliorative effects are associated with the regulation of intestinal microecology. Materials and methods: In this study, the curative effects of ETB on NAFLD were evaluated in mice fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined, high fat diet (CDAHFD). Biochemical markers and hepatic histological alter-ations were detected. Gut microbiota and faecal metabolites were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS) profiling.Results: The results showed that oral treatment with middle-and high-dose ETB significantly improved features of NAFLD, reducing the levels of TG, LDL-C, ALT and AST, and increasing the level of HDL-C. Liver histopathologic examination demonstrated that ETB attenuated lipid accumulation and hepatocellular necrosis. ETB treatment restored the structural disturbances of gut microbiota induced by CDAHFD, reduced the levels of Intestinimonas, Lachnoclostridium, and Lachnospirace-ae_FCS020_group, and increased Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. Moreover, untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that ETB could restore the disrupted taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and glutathione metabolism of the intestinal bacterial community in NAFLD mice.Conclusions: ETB was effective in ameliorating the NAFLD, possibly by remodelling the gut microbiota compo-sition and modulating the faecal metabolism metabolites of the host, highlighting the potential of TB as a resource for the development of anti-NAFLD drugs.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic joint inflammation, eventually leading to severe disability and premature death. At present, the treatment of RA is mainly to reduce inflammation, swelling, and pain. Commonly used drugs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs lack specificity and require long-term, high-dose administration, which can cause serious adverse effects. In addition, the oral, intravenous, and intra-articular injections will reduce patient compliance, resulting in high cost and low bioavailability. Due to these limitations, microneedles (MNs) have emerged as a new strategy to efficiently localize the drugs in inflamed joints for the treatment of RA. MNs can overcome the cuticle barrier of the skin without stimulating nerves and blood vessels. Which can increase patient compliance, improve bioavailability, and avoid systemic circulation. This review summarizes and evaluates the application of MNs in RA, especially dissolving MNs (DMNs). We encourage the use of MNs to treat RA, by describing the general properties of MNs, materials, preparation technology, drug release mechanism, and advantages. Furthermore, we discussed the biological safety, development prospects, and future challenges of MNs, hoping to provide a new strategy for the treatment of RA.

AB Potentilla anserina L polysaccharide (PAP) is known to regulate immunity. Poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) (PLGA) is a type of drug carrier with biocompatibility and biodegradable USFDA approved polymer, which possesses the advantages of high safety and good sustained-release effect. The DEC205 receptor, a type I membrane protein, is widely distributed on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and plays a key role in antigen recognition and presentation. In this study, we prepared Potentilla anserina L polysaccharide PLGA nanoparticles targeting DEC205 receptor (DEC205-PAPP) and characterized the nanoparticles with regards to their effects on immune activation in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DEC205-PAPP promoted the uptake activity of macrophages and increased the secretion of NO and cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-6, and GM-CSF), up-regulated the expression of CD80+, CD86+. In vivo, DEC205-PAPP elevated the immune organ index, induced DC maturation, promoted T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation, and increased the levels of antigen-specific IgG antibody and cy-tokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4), which prolonged the residence time of the OVA antigen in the immune organs and the lymph nodes. In conclusion, DEC205-PAPP had a slow-release effect, induced humoral and cellular immune responses, and could potentially be used as an effective antigen-targeted delivery system.

AB Temporal stability of ecosystem productivity is important for providing reliable ecosystem services under global changes. Great efforts have been made to explore the response of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) stability to nitrogen (N) enrichment, yet how it affects below-ground net primary productivity (BNPP) stability remains elusive, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem stability from the view of a whole system. Here, using a field manipulative experiment with six N addition rates (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 g N m(-2) year(-1)), we explored the response patterns and drivers of BNPP stability in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) in the alpine meadow. The results showed that BNPP stability at both soil depths showed a unimodal response to increasing N addition rates. Specifically, for both the topsoil and subsoil, low-level N addition significantly promoted BNPP stability, while high doses of N addition had no significant impact on BNPP stability, suggesting that current low level of N deposition likely benefits the stable provision of below-ground functioning. Furthermore, dominant species stability and species richness contributed most to the changes in BNPP stability in the topsoil, whereas only dominant species stability was the dominant driver of BNPP stability in the subsoil. This study is among the first to illuminate the main mechanisms underlying the responses of BNPP stability to N enrichment at various soil depths, which will advance our current understanding of N addition effects on below-ground processes and benefit the sustainable provision of ecosystem functioning in the context of atmospheric N deposition.

TI Wettability of liquid metals on PEDOT:PSS for soft electronics

ID CONDUCTIVITY; SENSORS; ALLOY
AB Due to the high conductivity and flexibility of liquid metal, soft electronics are believed to be an ideal material for wearable electronics. However, high surface tension and surface oxides make it extremely challenging to load liquid metals onto flexible hydrophilic substrates. In this study, the excellent wettability of liquid metals on poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was systematically examined. This prop-erty was attributed to the synergistic effect of chemical and physical adhesion of liquid metals on PEDOT:PSS. By loading PEDOT:PSS onto a hydrophilic substrate, liquid metals were selectively adhered to the PEDOT:PSS re-gion. As a result, a simple and high efficient PEDOT:PSS-assisted method for preparing liquid-metal soft elec-tronics was developed. More intriguingly, highly conductive PEDOT:PSS after doping treatment still maintained outstanding wettability to liquid metals, favoring the realization of non-corrosive electrical connections between liquid metals and low cost electrode material (Cu). This PEDOT:PSS-assisted strategy can be used to fabricate various liquid metal-based electronics including soft circuits, paper electronics (1D), flexible sensors (2D), and conductive foams (3D), offering huge potential for flexible electronics and wearable sensors.
