AB Owning to the factors of external mechanical loads and high heat flux deposition, various degrees of strain or stress are inevitably introduced into the structural materials of nuclear fusion reactors. The uniaxial compression effects on the geometries, electronic structures, mechanical properties, and stabilities of Fe128Hen and Fe127VacHen were studied by first-principles calculations in this work. The results show that the lattice suffers from a noticeable inclination or disorder as the strain reaches 15%. The maximum stress of the stress-strain curves implied that the mechanical characteristics decay considerably as the number of He atoms increases, but the presence of a vacancy mitigated this effect. Compressive strain decreases the stability of Fe atom in the perfect pure Fe system, but it slightly elevates the monovacancy formation energy from Fe128He3 onward. According to the binding energy of He-He, compressive strain enhanced the aggregation of He. The migration barriers of an interstitial He atom exhibit anisotropy under uniaxial compressive strain, which was explained by the variations of the surrounding architectures.

AB Meat quality in goats is partly determined by the intramuscular fat (IMF) content, which is associated with the proliferation and differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes. Emerging studies have suggested that miRNA plays a crucial role in adipocyte proliferation and differentiation. In our recent study, we observed the expression variations in miR-196a in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Jianzhou goats at different ages. However, the specific function and underlying mechanism of miR-196a in IMF deposition are still unclear. This study demonstrated that miR-196a significantly enhanced adipogenesis and apoptosis and reduced the proliferation of preadipocytes. Subsequently, RNA-seq was employed to determine genes regulated by miR-196a, and 677 differentially expressed genes were detected after miR-196a overexpression. The PI3K-Akt pathway was identified as activated in miR-196a regulating intramuscular adipogenesis via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and further verified via Western blot and rescue assays. Lastly, using RT-qPCR, Western blot, dual-luciferase, and rescue assays, we found that miR-196a promoted adipogenesis and suppressed the proliferation of intramuscular preadipocytes by the downregulation of MAP3K1. In summary, these results suggest that miR-196a regulates IMF deposition by targeting MAP3K1 and activating the PI3K-Akt pathway and provide a theoretical foundation for improving goat meat quality through molecular breeding.

AB Yak is an excellent germplasm resource on the Tibetan Plateau and is able to live in high-altitude areas with hypoxic, cold, and harsh environments. Studies on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in large ruminants commonly involve a combination strategy involving six transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, and Lin28 (OSKMNL). This strategy tends to utilize genes from the same species to optimize pluripotency maintenance. In this study, we cloned the six pluripotency genes (OSKMNL) from yak and constructed a multi-cistronic lentiviral vector carrying these genes. This vector efficiently delivered the genes into yak fibroblasts, aiming to promote the reprogramming process. We verified that the treated cells had several pluripotency characteristics, marking the first successful construction of a lentiviral system carrying yak pluripotency genes. This achievement lays the foundation for subsequent establishment of yak iPSCs and holds significant implications for yak-breed improvement and germplasm-resource conservation.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the most effective method for enhancing the quality of beef gel during refrigeration. To achieve this objective, the effects of various types of starch on the physicochemical properties and microstructure of beef gel during refrigeration were investigated. In this study, ground beef gel was chosen as the research subject, and six different types of starch were added: 6% tapioca starch, cassava-modified starch (acetylated distarch phosphate, ADSP), potato starch (PSP), modified potato starch (acetate starch, SA), corn starch (CSP), and modified corn starch (hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate, HPDSP). The quality indicators of ground beef were measured and analyzed throughout the cold storage at 4 degrees C on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The results demonstrated that the water capacity of beef mince supplemented with PSP and HPDSP was significantly greater (p < 0.05). Additionally, the gel strength was found to be the highest, while the mesh structure formed in the ADSP group was the greatest. Furthermore, HPDSP, PSP, and SA effectively inhibited the oxidation of meat fat, with SA showing a relatively good effect on delaying the oxidation of meat mince protein. The addition of starch can, to a certain extent, inhibit lipid and protein oxidation in meat mince. In conclusion, starch significantly enhances the quality of beef mince by improving water retention, gel strength, and microstructure during refrigeration.

The structure was meticulously characterized using a combination of IR, NMR, HRMS, and LC-MS techniques. Notably, upon the addition of S2-, the fluorescence of the probe DBA solution underwent a marked enhancement, transitioning from nearly colorless to brilliant yellow-green luminescence. The Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum and fluorescence emission were utilized to assess the probe DBA efficacy in detecting and identifying S2-. It exhibited a substantial fluorescence amplification, enabling quantitative detection within a concentration range of 0 to 17.1 mu M, and possessed a low detection limit of 66.89 nM. Moreover, this method boasts a high recovery rate, excellent accuracy, and usefulness for analysis when tracking S2-in real samples.

AB The kinetic theory is utilized to study the impact of student interaction on the grade point average (GPA) in social networks. The interactions between students can not only be through offline means but also social networks. To analyze the evolution of the student's GPA on social networks, we set up a joint GPA-connectivity density function and two Boltzmann models, which consider the general connectivity distribution of individuals and describe the structure of social networks statistically. In the model, we use the standard Heaviside function to divide the GPA into two parts, corresponding to the students' different learning attitudes. In addition, the number of contacts for each student is assumed to determine the probability of their learning attitudes being transmitted and successfully influencing another student. We investigate the evolution of the overall students' average GPA through the kinetic models and find the conditions for the reversal of GPA. Finally, numerical simulations reveal how social networks affect the students' GPA.

ID LOCAL-GOVERNMENT; ECONOMIC MAN; CRISIS
AB China's ethnic autonomous regions, inhabited by diverse ethnic groups and located near national borders or at provincial intersections, confront complex natural, relatively underdeveloped economic, and ethnic harmony challenges. Governments balance central government-assigned tasks and ethnic harmony, showing varied responses: some prioritize stability, others focus on management, and some are indifferent to local emergencies. Given this phenomenon, why do governments in these regions vary in their responses to emergencies? This research, based on government role theory, examines how role preferences influence government behavior in emergency management, identifying two key roles: economic man and social man, and establishes a four-quadrant role analysis framework: : local guardian, political competitor, moral paragon, and indifferent bystander. Grounded theory explains these roles and evaluation indicators, with evaluations from 44 scholars gathered via questionnaire, and the indicator weights determined using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The weight matrix then calculates economic man (X) and social man (Y) values for 272 cases based on expert scores. The research results reveal that (1) these governments exhibit an overall role preference of "local guardian > political competitor > indifferent bystander > moral paragon" in emergency management. (2) This ranking also reflects their preference for the economic man role. (3) Factors contributing to this ranking include cultural differences, administrative contracting, and performance tournaments within the Chinese system and administrative ethics. These findings provide theoretical insights into emergency management role preferences in multi-ethnic, multi-racial, and even multicultural regions, ultimately aiming to enhance local government emergency management efficiency, optimize policy formulation, and ensure community resilience.

AB FeWO4/g-C3N5 composites were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The composition and morphology of the catalysts were characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The composition of FeWO4 and g-C3N5 successfully reduces the band gap of g-C3N5 and broadens visible light response range. Moreover, the as-prepared FeWO4/g-C(3)N(5 )composites inhibit the recombination of photoinduced carriers and improve the charge mobility. FeWO4/g-C3N5 composites exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of organic dyes including methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and methyl orange (MO) under visible light irradiation. As for the MB degradation, the best degradation kinetic rate constant of FeWO4/g-C3N5 composite is 3.6 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N5. Moreover, FeWO4/g-C3N5 composite shows good photostability and reusability after cycling experiments, which may be used for the treatment of real wastewater. A Z-scheme mechanism of dye photodegradation by FeWO4/g-C(3)N(5 )composite was also proposed based on the trapping experiment of the responsible radical species.

AB Tilianin and linarin, two rare glycosylated flavonoids in the aromatic endangered medicinal plant Nardostachys jatamansi (D.on)DC., play an important role in the fields of medicine, cosmetics, food and dye industries. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their biosynthetic pathway. In this study, the phytochemical investigation of N. jatamansi resulted in the isolation of linarin. With help of AlphaFold2 to cluster the entire glycosyltransferase family based on predicted structure similarities, we successfully identified a flavonoid glycosyltransferase NjUGT73B1, which could efficiently catalyze the glucosylation of acacetin at 7-OH to produce tilianin, also the key precursor in the biosynthesis of linarin. Additionally, NjUGT73B1 displayed a high degree of substrate promiscuity, enabling glucosylation at 7-OH of many flavonoids. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that H19, H21, H370, F126, and F127 play the crucial roles in the glycosylation ability of NjUGT73B1. Notably, comparation with the wild NjUGT73B1, mutant H19K led to a 50% increase in the activity of producing tilianin from acacetin.

AB Saline wastewater is regarded as a challenge for wastewater treatment plants because high-salinity conditions negatively affect on traditional biological technologies. Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has gained attention as a promising technology for saline wastewater treatment because of its compact structure and the ability to withstand toxic loadings. Therefore, this study investigated the salt-resistance performance, sludge properties and microbial community of AGS under low-salinity and high-salinity conditions, with the saline concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 g/L. The results showed that AGS could withstand long-term saline stresses, and the maximum salinity reached 50 g/L within 113 d. Under salinities of 10, 30, and 50 g/L, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were 90.3%, 88.0% and 78.0%, respectively. AGS also its maintained strength and aggregation at salinities of 10 and 30 g/L. Overproduction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by non-halophilic bacteria that enhanced sludge aggregation. The compact structure that ensured the microorganisms bioactivity helped to remove organic matters under salinities of 10 and 30 g/L. At a salinity of 50 g/L, moderately halophilic bacteria, including Salinicola, Thioclava, Idiomarina and Albirhodobacter, prevailed in the reactor. The dominant microbial communities shifted to moderately halophilic bacteria, which could maintain aerobic granular stabilization and remove organic matters under 50 g/L salinity. These results in this study provide a further explanation for the long-term operation of AGS for treating saline wastewater at different salinities. It is hoped that this work could bring some clues for the mystery of salt-resistance mechanisms.

AB The electrochemical conversion of glycerol into high-value chemicals through the selective glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds importance in utilizing the surplus platform chemical component of glycerol. Nevertheless, it is still very limited in producing three-carbon chain (C3) chemicals, especially glyceric acid/glycerate, through the direct oxidation of its primary hydroxyl group. Herein, Pd microstructure electrodeposited on the Ni foam support (Pd/NF) is designed and fabricated to achieve a highly efficient GOR, exhibiting a superior current density of ca. 120 mA cm-2 at 0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and high selectivity of glycerate at ca. 70%. The Faradaic efficiency of C3 chemicals from GOR can still be maintained at ca. 80% after 20 continuous electrolysis runs, and the conversion rate of glycerol can reach 95% after 10-h electrolysis. It is also clarified that the dual-component interfaces constructed by the adjacent Pd and Ni sites are responsible for this highly efficient GOR. Specifically, Ni sites can effectively strengthen the generative capacity of the active adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad) species, which can steadily immigrate to the Pd sites, so that the surface adsorbed glycerol species are quickly oxidized into C3 chemicals, rather than breaking the C-C bond of glycerol; thus, neither form the C2/C1 species. This study may yield fresh perspectives on the electrocatalytic conversion of glycerol into high-value C3 chemicals, such as glyceric acid/glycerate.

AB Structured triacylglycerols (STAGs) with medium-chain fatty acids (FAs) at sn-1,3 positions and long-chain FAs at the sn-2 position are known as medium-long-medium (MLM) type STAGs. They can not only provide energy immediately and control weight effectively, but may also provide essential or beneficial FAs to meet the human needs. In this study, MLM type STAGs were synthesized from lipase-catalyzed acidolysis of peony seed oil (PSO) with octanoic acid (OcA) and decanoic acid (DA) as medium-chain FAs in solvent-free systems. Optimal reaction conditions were 1:8 (PSO to OcA/DA), 40 degrees C and 24 h. The OcA content and DA content at sn-1,3 of two STAGs were 81.1% and 82.5%. The total essential FA (alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid) contents at sn-2 reached 61.5% and 57.2%, and long-chain unsaturated FA contents reached 93.3% and 87.4%. Infrared absorptions of two STAGs were weaker than those of PSO at 723 cm(-1) [-(CH2)(n)-rocking] and 3011 cm(-1) [ = CH (cis) stretching]. The end melting temperature and maximum weight loss temperature of STAG rich in DA were higher than those of STAG rich in OcA. This study is conducive to the deep processing of PSO and provides a new and promising substrate for MLM type STAG synthesis.

AB The present study used a cross-lagged design to explore the bidirectional relationship between adolescents' prosocial behaviour and self-perceived physical health and to explore the mediating role of positive affect and the moderating role of openness to experience. A total of 1525 middle school students (Mage = 12.41, 47% male) in northern China were surveyed for 3 years. The results showed the following: (1) prosocial behaviour at T1 positively predicted self-perceived physical health at T3; and vice versa; and (2) this observed relation between prosocial behaviour and self-perceived physical health was explained by positive affect; (3) the mediating role of positive affect on the path from prosocial behaviour at T1 to self-perceived physical health at T3 was observed only among adolescents with high openness traits. This finding verified the protective effect of prosocial behaviour on the healthy development of the actor.

AB Feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection is a leading cause of death in cats. In this study, we produced FCoV-I viruslike particles (VLPs) containing E, M, N, and S proteins using a baculovirus expression system and mixed VLPs with the adjuvants MF59 and CpG 55.2 to prepare an VLP/MF59/CpG vaccine. After immunization of mice with the vaccine, IgG specific antibodies titers against S and N proteins increased to 1:12,800, and IFN-gamma+ and IL-4+ splenocytes were significantly increased. Following immunization of FCoV-negative cats, the S protein antibodies in immunized cats (5/5) increased significantly, with a peak of 1:12,800. Notably, after booster vaccination in FCoV-positive cats, a significant reduction in viral load was observed in the feces of partial cats (4/5), and the FCoV-I negative conversion was found in two immunized cats (2/5). Therefore, the VLP/MF59/CpG vaccine is a promising candidate vaccine to prevent the FCoV infection.

AB Underwater optical wireless sensor networks (UOWSNs) have exhibited significant importance in monitoring and utilizing marine resources because of their attractive advantages in security, data rates, and transmission latency. However, due to their limitations in divergence angle and communication range, tactful routing algorithms are highly desired by UOWSNs to guarantee their networking performance. In this article, we propose a multilayer energy-balanced opportunistic routing (MEOR) protocol for UOWSNs. By adopting the mobile multisink network architecture with fixed beam direction to alleviate the impact of hardware adjustment on networking performance, the proposed MEOR algorithm significantly enhances network connectivity and reduces energy consumption. Besides, the proposed MEOR algorithm jointly considers link quality and residual energy in selecting relay nodes and employs a void-handling mechanism in the routing process. In this way, the proposed MEOR algorithm can remarkably improve the packet delivery rate (PDR). In addition, an energy-balanced node deployment strategy is introduced by the proposed MEOR algorithm for energy balance to prolong the network lifetime. Simulation results show that the proposed MEOR algorithm achieves up to about 45% and 48% improvements in PDR and network lifetime with about 45% reduction in energy tax when compared to the classical routing algorithms employed in the simulations.

AB Intergroup trust is a crucial psychological foundation for promoting ethnic unity and maintaining social stability. This study explored the dynamic relationship between intergroup contact and trust among adolescents in ethnic regions of China and sought to uncover the mechanisms behind this relationship. Through a two-wave longitudinal survey of 679 adolescents, employing the Intergroup Contact Experience Scale, the Intergroup Trust Scale, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the study yielded several findings: (1) Over the year, a significant increase in intergroup contact was observed among the adolescents. Notably, junior high students demonstrated a marked rise in intergroup trust, whereas no significant change was discernible in high school students. (2) Cross-lagged analysis indicated that early intergroup contact significantly predicted subsequent intergroup trust and loneliness. Initial loneliness also forecasted future intergroup trust, yet early intergroup trust did not predict later intergroup contact or loneliness. (3) Loneliness served as a partial mediator in the longitudinal link between intergroup contact and trust among these adolescents. These findings reinforce the premise that in China's ethnic regions, intergroup contact is a precursor to intergroup trust, both directly enhancing trust among adolescents and indirectly by reducing loneliness.

AB The topic of how to solve cooperation dilemma has been extensively investigated, and numerous mechanisms involved third-party identities have been proposed to promote cooperation level. This paper considers a more realistic strategy named pseudo-cooperation (PC) in the prisoner's dilemma game, characterized by incomplete cooperation. Participants employing this strategy attempt to deceive others by superficial cooperation, thereby resulting in payoff increases when confronted with other strategies. Moreover, distinct strategic choices lead to dynamic changes in players' reputation, which in turn directly influences their income. Specifically, the reputation is incorporated into part of individuals' payoff rather than indirectly affecting them. Simulation experiments are respectively conducted in well-mixed and structured populations, and the results demonstrate that the reputation-based PC strategy significantly facilitates the emergence of cooperation behaviors in both environments. Furthermore, the criteria for the three types of players to emerge, vanish or dominate the system can be partially identified in well-mixed populations. Importantly, the region of high cooperation density in the square network is wider than those in well-mixed populations, which displays the positive role of network reciprocity.

AB Three previously undescribed and sixteen known alkaloids were bioguidedly isolated from the bulbs of Narcissus tazetta subsp. chinensis (M.Roem.) Masamura & Yanagih. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, NMR, and ECD. Eleven of the isolated alkaloids exhibited immunosuppressive activity on the proliferation of human T cells. (+)-Narciclasine (18) showed the most significantly suppressive activity with an IC50 value of 14 +/- 5 nM. In vitro, (+)-narciclasine (18) blocked NF-kappa B signal transduction, but did not affect PI3K/AKT signal transduction. What was more, (+)-narciclasine significantly reduced ALT and AST levels and alleviated liver damage induced by ConA in AIH mouse model.

AB Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 1 (NR4A1) acts as a transcription factor to participate in lots of physiological activities including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. In this study, we found that NR4A1 promoted goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation through the PI3K/AKT pathway. This study provides important information about NR4A1 in the intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation in goats and therefore identifies a target for goat meat quality improvement studies. As a transcription factor, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 1 (NR4A1) binds to downstream target genes to participate in cell proliferation and cell differentiation. We found that the NR4A1 reached the highest expression at 60 h after the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Overexpression of goat NR4A1 increased the number of intracellular lipid droplets and up-regulated the expression of adipocyte-differentiation-related marker genes including AP2, SREBP1, ACC, GPAM, and DGAT2, while the relative expression levels of Pref-1 and HSL were significantly decreased. On the contrary, after NR4A1 was knocked down by siRNA, the number of intracellular lipid droplets and the relative expression levels of LPL, CEBP alpha, CEBP beta, ACC, and DGAT2 were significantly decreased, and the relative expression levels of Pref-1 and HSL were significantly up-regulated. These results suggest that NR4A1 promotes the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Transcriptome sequencing was carried out after overexpression of goat NR4A1, and the KEGG enrichment analysis result showed that the most differentially expressed genes were related to adipocyte differentiation and were enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. LY249002, an inhibitor of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, was introduced and decreased the number of intracellular lipid droplets, and the relative expression levels of C/EBP alpha, SREBP1, AP2, C/EBP beta, GPAM, ACC, DGAT1, DGAT2, and ATGL were decreased accordingly. The above results indicate that overexpression of goat NR4A1 may promote the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

AB Some lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can provide significant health benefits, which are critically important for the conservation of endangered animals, such as giant pandas. However, little is known about the diversity and culturability of LAB in the giant panda gut microbiota. To understand the roles of LAB in giant panda conservation, it is critical to culture bacterial strains of interest. In this study, we established a pipeline to culture bacterial strains using enrichment of target bacteria with different liquid media and growth conditions. Then, the strains were isolated in solid media to study their functions. Using 210 samples from the culture enrichment method and 138 culture-independent samples, we obtained 1120 amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) belonging to Lactobacillales. Out of the 1120 ASVs, 812 ASVs from the culture enrichment approach were twofold more diverse than 336 ASVs from the culture-independent approach. Many ASVs of interest were not detected in the culture-independent approach. Using this pipeline, we isolated many relevant bacterial strains and established a giant panda gut bacteria strain collection that included strains with low-abundance in culture-independent samples and included most of the giant panda LAB described by other researchers. The strain collection consisted of 60 strains representing 35 species of 12 genera. Thus, our pipeline is powerful and provides guidance in culturing gut microbiota of interest in hosts such as the giant panda.IMPORTANCECultivation is necessary to screen strains to experimentally investigate microbial traits, and to confirm the activities of novel genes through functional characterization studies. In the long-term, such work can aid in the identification of potential health benefits conferred by bacteria and this could aid in the identification of bacterial candidate strains that can be applied as probiotics. In this study, we developed a pipeline with low-cost and user-friendly culture enrichment to reveal the diversity of LAB in giant pandas. We compared the difference between culture-independent and culture enrichment methods, screened strains of interest that produced high concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we investigated the catalog of virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, butyrate and lactate synthesis genes of the strains at a genomic level. This study will provide guidance for microbiota cultivation and a foundation for future research aiming to understand the functions of specific strains.

Herein, we developed 2D Raman mapping as a label-free technique to quantify graphene oxide (GO) in soil. After pre-treatment by hydrazine hydrate to quench its fluorescence, the quantification of GO in soil was achieved in the range of 0.1-1000 mg/L by measuring the average G-band intensity. In column transport experiment, the transport and retention of GO in soil depended on the solution chemistry. Lower pH and higher ionic strength hindered the transport of GO. In particular, Ca2+ showed the most obvious retardation on the transport of GO. GO enriched in the surficial soil layer by several folds of the initial concentrations, and higher GO concentration led to more surficial enrichment. The sowing manner of seeds affected the soil enrichment of GO, too. The surficial enrichment of GO reduced its direct contact with seedling roots, resulting in the alleviation of GO toxicity. Our results provided a facile method to study the environmental behaviors of graphene and highlighted the crucial impacts of environmental media on the graphene toxicity.

AB Cellulases play an important role in the bioconversion of lignocellulose. Microorganisms found in extreme environments are a potentially rich source of cellulases with unique properties. Due to the uniqueness of the environment, the abundant microbial resources in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are worth being explored. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize an acidic, mesophilic cellulase-producing microorganism from QTP. Moreover, the fermentation conditions for cellulase production were optimized for future application of cellulase in the development of lignocellulose biomass. A novel cellulase-producing strain, Penicillium oxalicum XC10, was isolated from the soil of QTP. The cellulase produced by XC10 was a mesophilic cellulase that exhibited good acid resistance and some cold-adaptation properties, with maximum activity at pH 4.0 and 40 degrees C. Cellulase activity was significantly enhanced by Na+ (p < 0.05) and inhibited by Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ (p < 0.05). After optimization, maximum cellulase activity (8.56 U/mL) was increased nearly 10-fold. Optimal fermentation conditions included an inoculum size of 3% (v/v) in a mixture of corn straw (40 g/L), peptone (5 g/L), and Mg2+ (4 g/L), at pH 4.0, 33 degrees C, and shaking at 200 rpm. The specific properties of the P. oxalicum XC10 cellulase suggest the enzyme may serve as an excellent candidate for the bioconversion and utilization of lignocellulose biomass generated as agricultural and food-processing wastes.

AB In this study, a nanoreactor-type catalyst was employed in the Heck reaction, with Pd NPs embedded into the shells of mesoporous hollow carbon spheres. Our findings highlight the critical role of both the cavity and mesoporous shell in achieving high activity and stability simultaneously. Additionally, by adjusting the size of the nanoreactor, the void-confinement effect diminishes as the available space increases. This study focuses on designing an intelligent Pd-based catalyst with enhanced catalytic activity toward the Heck reactions and good recyclability by using "in & out" strategy. This approach has the potential to provide microenvironmental engineering strategies for hollow nanostructures.

DT Article
DE Giardia intestinalis; Secreted proteins; Extracellular vesicles; Gene

ID LAMBLIA; ROLES
AB Giardiasis is a common waterborne zoonotic disease caused by Giardia intestinalis. Upon infection, Giardia releases excretory and secretory products (ESPs) including secreted proteins (SPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although the interplay between ESPs and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) has been previously described, the functions of EVs in these interactions and their differences from those of SPs require further exploration. In the present study, EVs and EV-depleted SPs were isolated from Giardia ESPs. Proteomic analyses of isolated SPs and EVs showed 146 and 91 proteins, respectively. Certain unique and enriched proteins have been identified in SPs and EVs. Transcriptome analysis of Caco-2 cells exposed to EVs showed 96 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 56 upregulated and 40 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that Caco-2 genes related to metabolic processes, the HIF-1 signaling pathway, and the cAMP signaling pathway were affected. This study provides new insights into host-parasite interactions, highlighting the potential significance of EVs on IECs during infections.

AB Background Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a world organization for animal health (WOAH) notifiable and economically important transboundary, highly communicable viral disease of small ruminants. PPR virus (PPRV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. Aim The present cross-sectional epidemiological investigation was accomplished to estimate the apparent prevalence and identify the risk factors linked with peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in the previously neglected northern border regions of Pakistan. Method A total of 1300 samples (serum = 328; swabs = 972) from 150 flocks/herds were compiled from sheep (n = 324), goats (n = 328), cattle (n = 324), and buffaloes (n = 324) during 2020-2021 and tested using ELISA for detection of viral antibody in sera or antigen in swabs. Results An overall apparent prevalence of 38.7% (504 samples) and an estimated true prevalence (calculated by the Rogan and Gladen estimator) of 41.0% (95% CI, 38.0-44 were recorded in the target regions. The highest apparent prevalence of 53.4% (85 samples) and the true prevalence of 57.0%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were documented in the Gilgit district and the lowest apparent prevalence of 53 (25.1%) and the true prevalence of 26.0%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 19.0-33.0) was reported in the Swat district. A questionnaire was designed to collect data about associated risk factors that were put into a univariable logistic regression to decrease the non-essential assumed risk dynamics with a P-value of 0.25. ArcGIS, 10.8.1 was used to design hotspot maps and MedCalc's online statistical software was used to calculate Odds Ratio (OR). Some of the risk factors significantly different (P < 0.05) in the multivariable logistic regression were flock/herd size, farming methods, nomadic animal movement, and outbreaks of PPR. The odds of large-sized flocks/herds were 1.7 (OR = 1.79; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.034-91.80%) times more likely to be positive than small-sized. The odds of transhumance and nomadic systems were 1.1 (OR = 1.15; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.022-58.64%) and 1.0 (OR = 1.02; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.020-51.97%) times more associated to be positive than sedentary and mixed farming systems, respectively. The odds of nomadic animal movement in the area was 0.7 (OR = 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.014-38.06%) times more associated to be positive than in areas where no nomadic movement was observed. In addition, the odds of an outbreak of PPR in the area were 1.0 (OR = 1.00; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.018-46.73%) times more associated to be positive than in areas where no outbreak of PPR was observed. Conclusions It was concluded that many northern regions considered endemic for PPR, large and small ruminants are kept and reared together making numerous chances for virus transmission dynamic, so a big threats of disease spread exist in the region. The results of the present study would contribute to the global goal of controlling and eradicating PPR by 2030.

   GEOMETRIES
AB Resulting from the solubility reduction of elemental sulfur during the development of high sulfur gas formations, sulfur deposition often occurs to reduce the gas production and threaten the safety of gas wells. Understanding the dissolution mechanism of elemental sulfur in natural gas is essential to reduce the risk caused by sulfur deposition. Because of the harsh conditions in the high-sulfur formations, it remains challenging to in situ characterize the dissolution-precipitation processes, making deficient the knowledge of sulfur dissolution mechanism. The dissolution of sulfur allotropes (S-N, N = 2, 4, 6 and 8) in H2S, the main solvent of sulfur in natural gas, is studied in this work by means of first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. While S-6 and S-8 undergo physical interaction with H2S under the conditions corresponding to those at 1-6 km stratigraphic depths, S-2 and S-4 react with H2S and form stable polysulfides. Unravelling the mechanism would be helpful for understanding and controlling the sulfur deposition in high-sulfur gas development.

AB The thymus -derived lymphocytes of jawed vertebrates have four T -cell receptor (TCR) chains that play a significant role in immunity. As chickens have commercial value, their immune systems require a great deal of attention. Local chicken breeds are an essential part of poultry genetic resources in China. Here, we used highthroughput sequencing to analyze the TCR alpha and TCR beta repertoires and their relative expression levels in the native chicken breeds Baier Buff, Longyou Partridge, Xiaoshan, and Xianju. We found that TCR V alpha and TCR V beta were expressed and included 17, 19, 17, and six segments of the V alpha 2, V alpha 3, V beta 1, and V beta 2 subgroups, respectively. V -J pairing was biased; J alpha 11 was utilized by nearly all V alpha segments and was the most commonly used. Breedspecific V segments and V -J pairings were detected as well. The results of the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) as well as the V -J pairing and CDR3 diversity analyses suggested that the four local chicken breeds did not significantly differ in terms of TCR diversity. Hence, they expressed not significant differentiation, and they are rich genetic resources for the development and utilization of immune -related poultry breeding.

AB Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a morbillivirus that causes the acute and highly pathogenic infectious disease peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in small ruminants and poses a major threat to the goat and sheep industries. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PPRV infection. Here, we propose Carboplatin, a platinum-based regimen designed to treat a range of malignancies, as a potential antiviral agent. We showed that Carboplatin exhibits significant antiviral activity against PPRV in a cell culture model. The mechanism of action of Carboplatin against PPRV is mainly attributed to its ability to block STING mediated autophagy. Together, our study supports the discovery of Carboplatin as an antiviral against PPRV and potentially other closely related viruses, sheds light on its mode of action, and establishes STING as a valid and attractive target to counteract viral infection.

AB Low-carbon development is a sustainable model characterized by low energy consumption, pollution, and low emissions. Although developed countries have provided many reference practices in low-carbon development, African countries encounter challenges in the implementation process due to poverty and a lack of appropriate decision models regarding low-carbon policy. This paper uses an optimization algorithm to confirm a better low-carbon development mechanism from carbon subsidies or taxes. This paper develops two optimization models for comparative analysis of the impact of carbon subsidies and carbon taxes under price caps for a low-carbon investment of firms and demand for energy products in Africa. The optimization model draws the following conclusions: (1) When the subsidy and carbon tax are low, the low carbon investment increases with the price cap; when the subsidy and carbon tax are high, the low carbon investment decreases. (2) A carbon subsidy is more suitable for higher-carbon abatement investment firms, and carbon taxes are more suitable for lower-carbon technology investment firms under a single policy environment. Policymakers can use these findings to develop and implement carbon pricing regimes that effectively encourage reduced carbon emissions.

DE Digital economy; Land resource mismatch; China broadband strategy;
   Housing costs
ID INVESTMENT; DEMAND; FINANCE; PRICES
AB Live in peace and work in contentment" encapsulates people's aspirations within a digital economy framework. Has the digital economy truly realized this ideal? To answer this query, this paper delves into the correlation between the digital economy, resource mismatch, and urban housing costs across 272 Chinese cities. It evaluates the impact of policies propelled by the digital economy, using the "Broadband China" strategy as a benchmark. The findings suggest several key conclusions: (i) The imbalance in land resources exacerbates the digital economy's impact on escalating urban housing expenses. This effect is particularly pronounced in cities within the Yangtze River Economic Zone, cities experiencing low economic growth rates, large cities with high employment levels, and cities with relatively low wages. (ii) The rise of the digital economy has contributed to increased urban housing costs. For every 0.1 unit increase in a city's digital economy level, there is an observed average rise of 9.87% in housing costs. (iii) Policies steered by the digital economy, such as the "Broadband China" strategy, have significantly increased urban housing costs. A higher degree of resource mismatch correlates with a more pronounced impact of the "Broadband China" strategy pilot in elevating urban housing expenses. It is imperative to emphasize the qualitative ramifications of the digital economy. This should coincide with efforts to enhance resource utilization efficiency, aiming to mitigate the adverse effects of the digital economy's advancement on housing costs.

AB Considering the diversity of battery data under dynamic test conditions, the stability of battery working data is affected due to the diversity of charge and discharge rates, variability of operating temperature, and randomness of the current state of charge, and the data types are multi-sourced, which increases the difficulty of estimating battery SOH based on data-driven methods. In this paper, a lithium-ion battery state of health estimation method with sample transfer learning under dynamic test conditions is proposed. Through the Tradaboost.R2 method, the weight of the source domain sample data is adjusted to complete the update of the sample data distribution. At the same time, considering the division methods of the six auxiliary and the source domain data set, aging features from different state of charge ranges are selected. It is verified that while the aging feature dimension and the demand for target domain label data are reduced, the estimation accuracy of the lithium-ion battery state of health is not affected by the initial value of the state of charge. By considering the mean absolute error, mean square error and root mean square error, the estimated error results do not exceed 1.2% on the experiment battery data, which highlights the advantages of the proposed methods.

AB Simple Summary Minerals are essential for maintaining the health and productivity of livestock. Yaks are mainly grazed rotationally in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but the natural forage nutrients in the alpine meadow are seasonal and even different every month, and the nutritional requirements of yaks at different ages are different. Therefore, it is very important to understand how host genes and microorganisms in the rumen of yaks at different ages coordinate to regulate the metabolism of mineral elements and other nutrients. In this study, we performed transcriptome and metagenomic analyses of the rumen and its contents at different age stages to explore the synergistic regulation of mineral metabolism by host genes and microorganisms. In total, 13 bacteria and 22 host genes were mainly involved in the regulation of metal ion binding. The results of this study are of great significance for the improvement of supplementary feeding and growth performance of yaks at different ages.Abstract Yaks are the main pillar of plateau animal husbandry and the material basis of local herdsmen's survival. The level of mineral elements in the body is closely related to the production performance of yaks. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of rumen epithelial morphology, transcriptomics and metagenomics to explore the dynamics of rumen functions, microbial colonization and functional interactions in yaks from birth to adulthood. Bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea and viruses colonized the rumen of yaks from birth to adulthood, with bacteria being the majority. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in five developmental stages, and the abundance of genus Lactobacillus and Fusobacterium significantly decreased with age. Glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes were the most highly represented in five different developmental stages, followed by glycosyltransferases (GTs) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), where the proportion of genes coding for CBMs increased with age. Integrating host transcriptome and microbial metagenome revealed 30 gene modules related to age, muscle layer thickness, nipple length and width of yaks. Among these, the MEmagenta and MEturquoise were positively correlated with these phenotypic traits. Twenty-two host genes involved in transcriptional regulation related to metal ion binding (including potassium, sodium, calcium, zinc, iron) were positively correlated with a rumen bacterial cluster 1 composed of Alloprevotella, Paludibacter, Arcobacter, Lactobacillus, Bilophila, etc. Therefore, these studies help us to understand the interaction between rumen host and microorganisms in yaks at different ages, and further provide a reliable theoretical basis for the development of feed and mineral element supplementation for yaks at different ages.

AB Tibetan pig is a unique pig breed native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. To investigate viral communities associated with porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), 167 respiratory samples were collected from Tibetan pigs in the Ganzi Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Sichuan province. Following library construction and Illunima Novaseq sequencing, 18 distinct viruses belonging to 15 viral taxonomic families were identified in Tibetan pigs with PRDC. Among the 18 detected viruses, 3 viruses were associated with PRDC, including porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2), Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV). The genomic sequences of two PCV-2 strains, three TTSuV strains, and one novel Porprismacovirus strain were assembled by SOAPdenovo software (v2). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that both PCV-2 strains belonged to PCV-2d, three TTSuVs were classified to TTSuV2a and TTSuV2b genotypes, and the Porprismacovirus strain PPMV-SCgz-2022 showed a close genetic relationship with a virus of human origin. Recombination analysis indicated that PPMV-SCgz-2022 may have originated from recombination events between Human 16,806 x 66-213 strain and Porcine 17,668 x 82-593 strain. Furthermore, the high proportion of single infection or co-infection of PCV2/TTSuV2 provides insight into PRDC infection in Tibetan pigs. This is the first report of the viral communities in PRDC-affected Tibetan pigs in this region, and the results provides reference for the prevention and control of respiratory diseases in these animals.

AB Building sector accounts for a substantial part of energy consumption (EC) and carbon emissions, mainly serving for building services engineering systems. As a known advanced high-efficiency equipment, air source heat pump (ASHP) has been increasingly used for indoor heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) for residential and public buildings. Thus how to pre-estimate the energy saving potential (ESP) for given ASHPs under different climatic conditions is of high value for practical engineering application. In this paper, upon thermodynamic perfectibility conception, a simplified ASHP model is proposed to simulate its dynamic thermal performance according to the disparity between real equipment and the ideal reverse Carnot cycle. Moreover, a novel thermodynamic approach is proposed to pre-estimate and compare the seasoning-based ESPs of ASHP used for both heating and cooling. For illustrative examples, a typical public building is chosen, and the AHSP-ESPs are obtained and analyzed for five cities of different climate zones in China (Qiqihar, Beijing, Chengdu, Kunming, and Guangzhou). Preliminary research results show that lower/higher ambient temperatures contribute to higher heating/cooling ESPs respectively. However, the correlation between building EC and thermodynamic perfectibility is in inverse proportion. At first, building EC decreases rapidly with the increase of thermodynamic perfectibility, but as the thermal performance of ASHP gets closer to the corresponding ideal ones, the impact of thermodynamic perfectibility on building EC gradually decreases. This work is of great significance in understanding the regional applicability of ASHP and building EC, and providing application references for real ASHP usage in building sectors.

AB Background The growth and development of organism were dependent on the effect of genetic, environment, and their interaction. In recent decades, lots of candidate additive genetic markers and genes had been detected by using genome-widely association study (GWAS). However, restricted to computing power and practical tool, the interactive effect of markers and genes were not revealed clearly. And utilization of these interactive markers is difficult in the breeding and prediction, such as genome selection (GS).Results Through the Power-FDR curve, the GbyE algorithm can detect more significant genetic loci at different levels of genetic correlation and heritability, especially at low heritability levels. The additive effect of GbyE exhibits high significance on certain chromosomes, while the interactive effect detects more significant sites on other chromosomes, which were not detected in the first two parts. In prediction accuracy testing, in most cases of heritability and genetic correlation, the majority of prediction accuracy of GbyE is significantly higher than that of the mean method, regardless of whether the rrBLUP model or BGLR model is used for statistics. The GbyE algorithm improves the prediction accuracy of the three Bayesian models BRR, BayesA, and BayesLASSO using information from genetic by environmental interaction (G x E) and increases the prediction accuracy by 9.4%, 9.1%, and 11%, respectively, relative to the Mean value method. The GbyE algorithm is significantly superior to the mean method in the absence of a single environment, regardless of the combination of heritability and genetic correlation, especially in the case of high genetic correlation and heritability.Conclusions Therefore, this study constructed a new genotype design model program (GbyE) for GWAS and GS using Kronecker product. which was able to clearly estimate the additive and interactive effects separately. The results showed that GbyE can provide higher statistical power for the GWAS and more prediction accuracy of the GS models. In addition, GbyE gives varying degrees of improvement of prediction accuracy in three Bayesian models (BRR, BayesA, and BayesCpi). Whatever the phenotype were missed in the single environment or multiple environments, the GbyE also makes better prediction for inference population set. This study helps us understand the interactive relationship between genomic and environment in the complex traits. The GbyE source code is available at the GitHub website (https://github.com/liu-xinrui/GbyE).

AB A highly efficient and simple cross-coupling reaction of N-aryl aluminum reagents with N-aryl thiosuccinimides for the synthesis of diarylsulide derivatives using CuCl (20 mol%) as a catalyst is reported. Under the optimum reaction conditions, the coupling reaction between aryl aluminum reagents with different substituents and N-aryl thiosuccinimides with different substituents can be carried out smoothly with 18-94% isolated yields of diarylsulides. The method avoids the use of expensive transition metals, such as Pd, Ir, or Rh, phosphine ligands, and has the advantages of simple operation and high reaction efficiency. The structures of all the target compounds are confirmed by (HNMR)-H-1 and (CNMR)-C-13.

AB Hair and fingernails, emerging as crucial biological physical evidence, play a prominent role in geographical traceability studies within the forensic anthropology. This study explored the potential of terahertz spectroscopy and chemometrics techniques in identifying hair and fingernail samples from various geographical regions. A total of 196 hair and fingernail samples underwent scanning with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Different chemometric tools, including multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and Fisher discriminant analysis, were employed for model building on fingernail dataset, hair dataset, and fusion data, respectively. The performance of models constructed based on different datasets was compared and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Results revealed that the fusion data, employing the Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) algorithm, exhibited the best recognition ability, achieving a 100 % accuracy rate and F-value. Terahertz spectroscopy combined with FDA algorithm emerged as an effective and convenient tool for differentiating hair and fingernail samples from diverse geographical regions. This innovative technique boasts environmental friendliness, rapid analyses, and minimal sample preparation requirements compared to traditional methods.

AB IGFBP3 (Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3) constitutes a crucial constituent of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which are intimately associated with the organism's growth and development processes. Despite its significance, the precise function of IGFBP3 in yak liver development remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we systematically examined the expression profile of IGFBP3 in the liver tissues of yaks across various growth stages, elucidated its influence on the activity of yak hepatocytes, and probed its effects on murine liver development. A comparative analysis revealed that the expression of IGFBP3 was significantly higher in the liver tissue of 5-year-old yaks compared to their 15-month-old and 1-day-old counterparts (P < 0.01). To further validate its biological function, pET-28a-BgIGFBP3 prokaryotic expression vector was constructed. Upon exposing yak hepatocytes to varying concentrations of Bos grunniens (Bg) IGFBP3 protein, we observed augmented cellular activities and elevated colony formation rates. Moreover, our investigation revealed the upregulation of key genes within the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, including ERBB2, IRS1, PIK3R1, AKT1, RAF1, MAP2K2, and MAPK3, in both yak hepatocyte cultures and murine models. These findings collectively indicate that BgIGFBP3 promotes the proliferation of yak hepatocytes and enhances murine liver development by modulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The functional relevance of BgIGFBP3 was substantiated through in vivo and in vitro experiments, thereby underscoring its potential as a regulatory factor in liver development processes.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes data collection, especially in e-healthcare, where patients data from wearables and sensors improves medical services. However, IoT's limitations in computing and storage require cloud outsourcing. Combining IoT with the cloud has potential but raises concerns about data security. Leveraging cloud storage presents an attractive solution for accommodating the substantial volume of data outsourced by IoT devices. As the outsourcing of real-time data to cloud storage becomes commonplace, the adoption of data auditing schemes emerges as a means to ensure data integrity. To curtail operational expenses, various deduplication techniques are commonly employed on outsourced data, effectively sidestepping redundant data and resulting in storage and bandwidth efficiencies. Although real-time data typically remains distinct due to its diverse origins, scenarios, such as data sharing or trading in data-driven services and datamarkets, can lead to data redundancy. Moreover, in order to fortify against any potential information leakage, encryption is implemented prior to deduplication. Convergent encryption (CE) stands as a prominent exemplar of this approach. Effectively integrating data auditing, deduplication, and encryption for wireless sensor devices is no trivial task. To efficiently and securely accommodate data while authenticating them through a heterogeneous framework, we present a novel remote data checking scheme, denoted as the VRDC scheme. This scheme empowers IoT data to be encrypted, updated, deduplicated, and audited, aligning with the imperatives of security, privacy, and efficiency. Through comprehensive security analysis, we establish that our VRDC scheme is fortified against potential threats. Our experimental findings highlight the efficiency of our approach in the realms of auditing, deduplication, and updates. Furthermore, the evidence highlights the potential for optimization within our scheme when compared to related works. This is achieved through the careful management of dynamic update scales within a file.

AB Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is an acute fatal disease caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). Since the first outbreaks of type 2 RHDV (RHDV2) in April 2020 in China, the persistence of this virus in the rabbit population has caused substantial economic losses in rabbit husbandry. Previous failures in preventing RHDV2 prompted us to further investigate the immune mechanisms underlying the virus's pathogenicity, particularly concerning the spleen, a vital component of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). For this, a previous RHDV2 isolate, CHN/SC2020, was utilized to challenge naive adult rabbits. Then, the splenic transcriptome was determined by RNA-Seq. This study showed that the infected adult rabbits had 3148 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were associated with disease, signal transduction, cellular processes, and cytokine signaling categories. Of these, 100 upregulated DEGs were involved in inflammatory factors such as IL1 alpha, IL-6, and IL-8. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway, which may play a vital role in CHN/SC2020 infection. At the same time, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly increased in the spleen at the late stages of infection. These findings suggested that RHDV2 (CHN/SC2020) might induce dysregulation of the cytokine network and compromise splenic immunity against viral infection, which expanded our understanding of RHDV2 pathogenicity.

AB A public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme allows users to share encrypted data through cloud servers. However, an inside adversary may launch inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA) for a given trapdoor and guess the keyword. Public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) is a variant of PEKS scheme that can resist IKGA. Most PAEKS schemes cannot resist quantum attacks. To solve this problem, we propose two lattice-based PAEKS schemes under random oracle and standard model respectively. We also improve the security model of PAEKS and prove the security of our schemes under the improved model. The ciphertext and trapdoor sizes of our first scheme are about half of those of the existing lattice-based PAEKS scheme CM22, and the test phase computation overhead of our scheme is about 50.37% of CM22.

   limits of claims; Lower limits of claims
AB Based on various limited claim modes and the idea of option pricing, we build a pricing model system for small and micro loan insurance that conforms to the actuarial principle. It is found that different limited claim modes endow loan insurance contracts with various option attributes, which can be used to price small and micro loan insurance. Moreover, under the conditions of setting the upper and lower limits of claims separately or simultaneously, the pricing laws of loan insurance determined by such factors as insurance period may differ. Compared with the mode of relative deductible, the adoption of the mode of absolute deductible as the lower limit of a claim is more conducive to reducing the price of small and micro loan insurance. Our study provides a set of feasible theoretical solution for small and micro loan insurance pricing from a new perspective of limited claims.

AB In this paper, a double REduced SURface Field (RESURF) P-GaN gate AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistor with a partial N-GaN channel (DR-HFET) is proposed to improve the on-state performance in the high-voltage P-GaN gate AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistor (PG-HFET). The partial N-GaN channel between the gate and the drain increases the carrier density in the channel layer, and markedly reduces the on-resistance (Ron). The P-top layer and the P-buffer layer modulate the distribution of the electric field along the GaN channel to achieve a high breakdown voltage. After validation of the simulation models and parameters, the DR-HFETs are optimized using the charge balance principle. The optimum DR-HFET with a gate-to-drain distance of Lgd = 6 mu m shows a BV of 1100 V and Ron of 5.5 omega mm, which is 50.9% of the Ron in PG-HFET. The highest Baliga figure of merit (BFOM) of 2.3 GW/cm2 is obtained when the channel charge density Qch is 3.2 x 1013 cm-2 and the ratio of the P-top charge density Qpt to the buffer charge density Qbuf is 1.625. We also examine the influence of the AlGaN/GaN quality on the performance of the DR-HFETs. The simulation results indicate that the double RESURF structure may be less effective in the high-quality AlGaN/GaN epitaxial layer. Overall, the DR-HFET shows a good balance between off-state blocking capability and on-state performance.

AB The overuse of antibiotics has led to the enhanced resistance of many pathogenic bacteria, posing a threat to human health. Therefore, there is a need to develop green and safe alternatives to antibiotics. Beta-defensins play a crucial role in host defense against pathogens and have multifunctional properties, exerting key roles in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as non-immune processes. In this study, a 210 bp long cDNA sequence of yak DEFB114 gene was amplified and successfully expressed in a prokaryotic system. The DEFB114 protein exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro. When co-cultured with yak macrophages, DEFB114 protein enhanced macrophage phagocytic activity and increased nucleic acid fluorescence intensity (P < 0.05). DEFB114 protein also enhanced the activity of yak macrophages stimulated by inactivated Aspergillus fumigatus spores, increased the release of nitric oxide (NO), and promoted the expression of genes such as gamma-actin, Lgals, Man2b, and Capg (P < 0.05). In mice experiments, DEFB114 protein promoted resistance against Aspergillus fumigatus infection, by regulating the NOD1/2-ATG16L1-NF-kappa B pathway to modulate the host immune response and exert its anti-infective effects. In summary, the yak DEFB114 protein could inhibit the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus and enhance the animal's resistance to pathogenic microorganisms, thereby having significant implications in the treatment and prevention of fungal infections.

AB The combustion of agricultural and forestry residues, along with subsequent runoff, can lead to the production of a significant quantities of dissolved black carbon (DBC), which plays a pivotal role in the photo-transformation of organic pesticides. As a result, the photochemical activity of DBC and its associated photo-transformation mechanisms must elucidate. This study investigated the effect of DBC on tetrachlorantraniliprole (TCTP) photo-transformation, a new type of pesticide independently developed and widely used in China, using photochemical simulation experiments. The results revealed that the prepared DBC had a smaller molecular weight and higher aromaticity, generating 3DBC*, & sdot;OH, and 1O2, with apparent quantum yields of 4.75 x 10-2, 4.35 x 10-5, and 4.01 x 10-2, respectively. 3DBC* was the dominant intermediate reactive responsible for accelerating TCTP photolysis by determining its direct photolysis rate constant as 0.278 min-1. The degradation pathway of TCTP mainly involved nucleophilic substitution, dechlorination, and cleavage of the C-N bond. Notably, TCTP can photo-generate the cross-condensation products only in the presence of DBC. Ecotoxicity and organ-specific toxicity analysis demonstrated reduced environmental risks compared to TCTP for both direct photoproducts, as well as those mediated by DBC. These findings highlighted how DBC altered the phototransformation pathway leading to decreased environmental risk-associated amide pesticides.

AB Introduction Elymus nutans holds ecological and pastoral significance due to its adaptability and nutritional value, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a key hub for its genetic diversity. To conserve and harness its genetic resources in highland ecosystems, a thorough assessment is vital. However, a comprehensive phylogeographic exploration of E. nutans is lacking. The objective of this study was to unravel the genetic diversity, adaptation, and phylogenetics of E. nutans populations. Methods Encompassing 361 individuals across 35 populations, the species' genetic landscape and dynamic responses to diverse environments were decoded by using four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences and nine microsatellite markers derived from the transcriptome. Results and discussion This study unveiled a notable degree of genetic diversity in E. nutans populations at nuclear (I = 0.46, He = 0.32) and plastid DNA levels (Hd = 0.805, pi = 0.67). Analysis via AMOVA highlighted genetic variation predominantly within populations. Despite limited isolation by distance (IBD), the Mekong-Salween Divide (MSD) emerged as a significant factor influencing genetic differentiation and conserving diversity. Furthermore, correlations were established between external environmental factors and effective alleles of three EST-SSRs (EN5, EN57 and EN80), potentially linked to glutathione S-transferases T1 or hypothetical proteins, affecting adaptation. This study deepens the understanding of the intricate relationship between genetic diversity, adaptation, and environmental factors within E. nutans populations on the QTP. The findings shed light on the species' evolutionary responses to diverse ecological conditions and contribute to a broader comprehension of plant adaptation mechanisms.

AB High performance with good stability is important for practical application of electronic devices. As abundant researches related to the stability at room temperature and above have been adopted, the characteristic at extreme cold region is little concentrated on, impeding the development of plateau section. Herein, the stability of electrical properties is emphasized on at extreme cold region for the KNN ceramics with polycrystal phase boundary. Rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phase boundary is successfully formed from extreme cold region to room temperature. Notably, stable polarization is revealed with maintained R-O phase boundary. Little changed piezoelectric response is gained with modified R-O phase boundary, indicating that abundant O and lesser R phases coexistence is beneficial of improving temperature stability at extreme cold region. Thus, this work demonstrates a tool for optimizing performance at extreme cold region of lead-free ceramics, accelerating the application of electronic devices at plateau-climate regions.

AB In this study, the standard tent used by the China International Medical Team (Sichuan) was used as the research object to study the internal temperature change in medical tents in a low-temperature environment relying on heating equipment. Method: Four temperature sensors were arranged along the horizontal direction at a 1.2 m height in the medical tent, and more sensors were installed at heights of 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 2.5 m. A total of 11 temperature sensors were set. Temperature tests were conducted in January and February 2021 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. During the test, the running time of the heating equipment was controlled in real time according to the temperature change trend. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov(K-S) test was used to verify the reliability of the experimental data. The temperature change trend was used to characterize the influence of the heating and cooling equipment on the temperature change inside the tent. Results: Due to the position angle of the heating equipment and the influence of the external environment, the spatial distribution of the ambient temperature inside the medical tent was obviously uneven. In winter, an electric heater with a heating power of about 2500 W can increase the internal temperature of the tent to 16.7 degrees C, significantly improving the internal thermal environment of the medical tent. The ambient temperature in the medical tent is positively correlated with the height and the installation position of the heating equipment. Conclusion: Medical tents can maintain the ambient temperature well to meet medical needs with the support of heating equipment with sufficient power. The temperature distribution law of medical tents in this experiment has good guiding significance for the placement angle of heating equipment and the configuration position of medical equipment and provides a reference for the development of thermal insulation materials for medical tents.

AB The current study developed a moderated mediation model to investigate the effects of parental perfectionist expectations on online gaming addiction and its underlying mechanisms among Chinese undergraduates. 6403 Chinese undergraduates from Guangxi and Sichuan (51.0% males, mean age = 19.17 years) consented to take part in the study. The findings revealed that trait anxiety and perceived stress significantly mediated the relationship between parental perfectionist expectations and online gaming addiction. Moreover, flow experience moderated the effects of parental perfectionist expectations and trait anxiety on online gaming addiction, and this relationship was stronger with higher flow experience. These findings underscore the importance of a relatively comprehensive approach that takes into account both parental and individual factors when designing prevention and intervention strategies for online gaming addiction.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of 2-alknyl benzo[d]thiazoles has been developed by palladium and copper catalyzed the cross-coupling reaction of 2-thiobenzo[d]thiazoles with (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic alkynylaluminum reagents. Various 2-alkynyl benzo[d]thiazole derivatives can be obtained in 19-97 % isolated yields using 1 mol% PdCl2(dppf)/5 mol% xanthpos as the catalyst and CuI (3 equiv.) as desulfurization agent. The cross-coupling reaction can be carried out smoothly with electron-donating or -withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring of the organo aluminum reagents or the 2-thiobenzo[d]thiazoles. Furthermore, the broad substrate scope and the maintenance of high efficiency on a gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize 2-alkynylbenzo[d]thiazole derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM; FUSION
AB In LEO satellite communication networks, the number of satellites has increased sharply, the relative velocity of satellites is very fast, then electronic signal aliasing occurs from time to time. Those aliasing signals make the receiving ability of the signal receiver worse, the signal processing ability weaker, and the anti-interference ability of the communication system lower. Aiming at the above problems, to save communication resources and improve communication efficiency, and considering the irregularity of interference signals, the underdetermined blind separation technology can effectively deal with the problem of interference sensing and signal reconstruction in this scenario. In order to improve the stability of source signal separation and the security of information transmission, a greedy optimization algorithm can be executed. At the same time, to improve network information transmission efficiency and prevent algorithms from getting trapped in local optima, delete low-energy points during each iteration process. Ultimately, simulation experiments validate that the algorithm presented in this paper enhances both the transmission efficiency of the network transmission system and the security of the communication system, achieving the process of interference sensing and signal reconstruction in the LEO satellite communication system.

AB This study aimed to explore the relationship between intergroup contact quantity and intergroup trust and test the mediating role of intergroup contact quality and the moderating role of Chinese national identity among Tibetan adolescents in China. The study surveyed 705 Tibetan adolescents in Southwest China (57% females; Mage = 15.80 +/- 1.63 years) employing cluster sampling using the Intergroup Trust Scale, Intergroup Contact Experience Scale, Chinese National Identity Scale, and a self-made demographic questionnaire. The results showed that after controlling for demographic variables such as gender, academic stage, and school type, the intergroup contact quantity of Tibetan adolescents positively predicted intergroup trust through the mediating effect of intergroup contact quality. In addition, the degree of affiliation with Chinese national identity positively predicted intergroup trust. Furthermore, after controlling for the indirect effect of intergroup contact quality, Chinese national identity was found to moderate the direct effect of intergroup contact quantity on intergroup trust. This study highlights the importance of integrating the theoretical frameworks of intergroup contact and social identity in research on intergroup relationships in China's diverse and integrated contexts.

AB Grain processed by lactic acid (LA) is known to improve ruminant growth and health. However, the exact mechanism regarding rumen hydrolysis of LA-treated grain is still ambiguous. This experiment was designed to compare the effects of 5% LA treatment on the trophic and morphological variations in corn and to discover the alternations in ruminal hydrolysis between LA-treated and untreated corn macroscopically and microscopically using in vitro fermentation method. The results showed that, compared with untreated corn (CN), corn treated with 5% LA for 48 h (CNLA) experienced a decrease in the dry matter, albumin fraction, aNDFom, and water-soluble carbohydrate content but an increase in the resistant starch content. The in vitro fermentation showed that the pH of CNLA was higher, but dry matter disappearance was lower than that of CN. Most of the fermentation indices were unaffected, except for decreased iso-butyrate and iso-valerate. The abundances of total bacteria, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis, and Selenomonas ruminantium were higher, but those of Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus were lower in CNLA than in CN. There were differences in the scanning electron micrographs between CNLA and CN after 3 h of fermentation. This study suggests that treating corn with LA for 48 h can induce changes in its nutrient composition and alter the bacterial flora during subsequent in vitro fermentation. These changes appeared to be crucial contributors to the beneficial effects observed in rumen fermentation.

AB Mass transfer processes, cycles and associated conversion devices find wide application in air-conditioning. However, several optimization problems concerning mass-related devices and systems persist due to the absence of corresponding optimization principles and methods. For instance, akin to the Carnot cycle representing the ideal heat-work conversion cycle, what constitutes the ideal mass transfer cycle? Moreover, how can this ideal mass cycle be utilized to optimize practical systems? In this paper, a new approach based on inverse problem and variation method is utilized to address these problems. Firstly, as analogy to Carnot heat cycle, a four-process reversible ideal mass cycle is deduced to achieve maximal overall conversion efficiency. Secondly, the cycle perfectness index (epsilon) is defined, to depict the performance disparity of a certain practical irreversible mass cycle from the ideal one. Thirdly, three typical liquid desiccant air-conditioning processes are compared with considerations of solution/air states and system coefficient of performance (COP). This study aims to offer fresh insights into mass transfer processes and systems, providing guidance and references for optimizing practical system designs involving mass cycling, including liquid desiccant air conditioning systems for indoor dehumidification in buildings.

AB Escherichia coli is a major bacterial pathogen which causes diarrhea in the giant panda. This study investigated the biological characteristics of 100 E. coli strains isolated from fecal samples collected from 100 captive giant pandas of different age groups and sexes. A standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed with the isolates and we then further evaluated the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) by high-throughput quantitative PCR. Additionally, we then analyzed O serogroups through a slide agglutination test, virulence genes and the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) by PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that the 100 E. coli strains were mainly resistant to ENR (68%), AM (56%), IPM (55%), AMX (54%) and CA (52%), but were susceptible to MEM and FOX. The resistance to TZP, AK, FEP, CAZ, AMS, AZM, AT and IPM was significantly related to age (p < 0.05); the resistance rate of E. coli isolated from female giant pandas to N was significantly higher than in males (p < 0.05). Forty-five different types of ARGs were found, which included a total of 2,258 ARGs, in the 100 E. coli isolates. The top 10 of detection rate of ARGs were: acrA-04, acrA-05, aacC, bla(CTX-M-04), ampC-04, bla(SHV-01), bla(TEM), sul2, bla(OXY), tetA-02. ARGs aac (6 ')I1, blaCTX-M-03, tetD-02, blaSHV-02 and blaOXY were significantly related to age (p < 0.05), blaSHV-02, blaNDM and ampC-04 were related to sex (p < 0.05). Twelve different O serogroups from 32 E. coli isolates were distinguished, including O4, O8, O9, O15, O18, O20, O55, O88, O112, O157, O158, and O167. The most prevalent O serotype was O20, but O28, O45, O101, O149, and O152 were not detected. Fourteen different types of virulence genes were detected in the 100 E. coli isolates, of which papA (99%) were highly detected, while hlyA, elt and estA were not detected. MLST showed that 41 STs, which had one CCs and six groups with SLVs, in the 100 E. coli strains were identified, the main type was ST37. Our results advocate the need of strict biosecurity and surveillance programs in order to prevent the spread of pathogenic bacteria in the captive giant panda population.

AB Livestock-polluted water is a pressing water environmental issue in plateau pastoral regions, necessitating the adoption of eco-friendly solutions. Despite periphyton being a promising alternative, its efficacy is limited by the prevalence of intense ultraviolet radiation, particularly ultraviolet-B (UVB), in these regions. Therefore, this study employs molecular tools and small-scale trials to explore the crucial role of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in modulating periphyton characteristics and mediating nutrient removal from livestock-polluted water under UVB exposure. The results revealed that IAA augments periphyton's resilience to UVB stress through several pathways, including increasing periphyton's biomass, producing more extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthetic activity of periphyton. Moreover, IAA addition increased periphyton's bacterial diversity, reshaped bacterial community structure, enhanced community stability, and elevated the R2 value of neutral processes in bacterial assembly from 0.257 to 0.651 under UVB. Practically, an IAA concentration of 50 mg/L was recommended. Small-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of IAA in assisting UVB-stressed periphyton to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from livestock-polluted water, without the risk of nitrogen accumulation. These findings offer valuable insights into the protection of aquatic ecosystems in plateau pastoral regions based on periphyton property in an eco-friendly manner.

ID 2-SAMPLE TEST
AB We propose a new spectral-based approach to hypothesis testing for populations of networks. The primary goal is to develop a test to determine whether two given samples of networks come from the same random model or distribution. Our test statistic is based on the trace of a centered and scaled adjacency matrix to the third power, which we prove converges to the standard normal distribution as the number of nodes tends to infinity. We also provide the asymptotic power guarantee of the test. We explore the relationship between the number of networks and the number of nodes in each network when characterizing the theoretical properties of the proposed test statistic. Our test can be applied to both binary and weighted networks, operates under a very general framework in which the networks are allowed to be large and sparse, and can be extended to multiple-sample testing. We present a simulation study that demonstrates the superior performance of our tests over that of existing methods, and apply our tests to three real data sets.

AB Implantable medical devices (IMDs) in medical sciences have provided a quantum leap in network transformation. The communication network with IMDs typically has a wireless radio frequency (RF) telemetry or wired connection. IMDs, being devices, have more computing, communication capabilities and decision-making. Furthermore, these devices are being used to improve patients' quality of life by medicating various chronic diseases. The captured data is stored in a medical server through a controller node. Our work focuses on wireless communication, so sensitive patient data over a public channel might be tampered with or eavesdropped by unauthorised access. Furthermore, the leakage of health data and malfunctioning of IMDs are vital in constructing cryptographic protocols, particularly in the design of remote user authentication. In this paper, we proposed a novel secure remote user authentication scheme using a lightweight consortium blockchain for the communication network with IMDs.

AB Key messageWe developed an array of Zea-Tripsacum tri-hybrid allopolyploids with multiple ploidies. We unveiled that changes in genome dosage due to the chromosomes pyramiding and shuffling of three species effects karyotypic heterogeneity, reproductive diversity, and phenotypic variation in Zea-Tripsacum allopolyploids.AbstractPolyploidy, or whole genome duplication, has played a major role in evolution and speciation. The genomic consequences of polyploidy have been extensively studied in many plants; however, the extent of chromosomal variation, genome dosage, phenotypic diversity, and heterosis in allopolyploids derived from multiple species remains largely unknown. To address this question, we synthesized an allohexaploid involving Zea mays, Tripsacum dactyloides, and Z. perennis by chromosomal pyramiding. Subsequently, an allooctoploid and an allopentaploid were obtained by hybridization of the allohexaploid with Z. perennis. Moreover, we constructed three populations with different ploidy by chromosomal shuffling (allopentaploid x Z. perennis, allohexaploid x Z. perennis, and allooctoploid x Z. perennis). We have observed 3 types of sexual reproductive modes and 2 types of asexual reproduction modes in the tri-species hybrids, including 2n gamete fusion (2n + n), haploid gamete fusion (n + n), polyspermy fertilization (n + n + n) or 2n gamete fusion (n + 2n), haploid gametophyte apomixis, and asexual reproduction. The tri-hybrids library presents extremely rich karyotype heterogeneity. Chromosomal compensation appears to exist between maize and Z. perennis. A rise in the ploidy of the trihybrids was linked to a higher frequency of chromosomal translocation. Variation in the degree of phenotypic diversity observed in different segregating populations suggested that genome dosage effects phenotypic manifestation. These findings not only broaden our understanding of the mechanisms of polyploid formation and reproductive diversity but also provide a novel insight into genome pyramiding and shuffling driven genome dosage effects and phenotypic diversity.

AB Magnetic sensor arrays are typically used to detect magnetic targets. Currently, research on sensor array calibration focuses on solving the problems of inconsistent sensitivity, zero offset, and non-orthogonality in individual sensors, and misalignment errors between sensors. However, in magnetic field detection, sensor arrays are usually mounted on a platform or carried as a handheld device and are prone to random swaying during the detection process, leading to changes in the attitude and position of the magnetic sensors, which in turn generates swaying errors. In this study, the source of swaying error in sensor arrays was first analyzed theoretically, and a swaying error model of a magnetic sensor was established. Second, a swaying error calibration method was proposed in combination with the classical prediction model-Gaussian process regression (GPR), backpropagation (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) in the field of artificial intelligence. The experimental results show that the prediction performance based on the BP neural network is the most outstanding. After correction, the relative error percentage of the swaying error in the magnetic field data decreased significantly from 165.50% to 9.35%, which is a significant improvement of the correction effect. In addition, we conducted model comparison experiments in different environments, and the results show that the BP model performs well in various environments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and robustness. Finally, the distance error of the magnetic dipole position was significantly reduced after calibration, from 1.56, 1.12, and 2.50 m to 0.17, 0.04, and 0.04 m, respectively. Thus, the effectiveness of the calibration method was verified.

AB Litter decomposition is key to ecosystem carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, but this process is anticipated to weaken due to projected more extensive and prolonged drought. Yet how litter quality and decomposer community complexity regulate decomposition in response to drought is less understood. Here, in a five-year manipulative drought experiment in a Masson pine forest, leaf litter from four subtropical tree species (Quercus griffithii Hook.f. & Thomson ex Miq., Acacia mangium Willd., Pinus massoniana Lamb., Castanopsis hystrix Miq.) representing different qualities was decomposed for 350 d in litterbags of three different mesh sizes (i.e., 0.05, 1, and 5 mm), respectively, under natural conditions and a 50% throughfall rain exclusion treatment. Litterbags of increasing mesh sizes discriminate decomposer communities (i.e., microorganisms, microorganisms and mesofauna, microorganisms and meso- and macrofauna) that access the litter and represent an increasing complexity. The amount of litter C and nitrogen (N) loss, and changes in their ratio (C/Nloss), as well as small and medium-sized decomposers including microorganisms, nematodes, and arthropods, were investigated. We found that drought did not affect C and N loss but decreased C/Nloss(i.e., decomposer N use efficiency) of leaf litter irrespective of litter quality and decomposer complexity. However, changes in the C/Nloss and the drought effect on C loss were both dependent on litter quality, while drought and decomposer complexity interactively affected litter C and N loss. Increasing decomposer community complexity enhanced litter decomposition and allowing additional access of meso- and macro-fauna to litterbags mitigated the negative drought effect on the microbial-driven decomposition. Furthermore, both the increased diversity and altered trophic structure of nematode due to drought contributed to the mitigation effects via cascading interactions. Our results show that litter quality and soil decomposer community complexity co-drive the effect of drought on litter decomposition. This experimental finding provides a new insight into the mechanisms controlling forest floor C and nutrient cycling under future global change scenarios.

AB Natural convection in cavity plays a significant role in energy-related field, including the indoor heat transfer analysis in greenhouse with integrated PV roof. In this study, mathematical model is established for two-dimensional heat transfer analysis in greenhouse air cavity, with numerical simulation through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Main natural convection impact factors, such as system configuration parameters (tilting angle and PV panel unit number) and fluid thermal-physical properties, are investigated with indoor temperature distribution and streamline comparison by finite-volume method (FVD). Preliminary results show that with rising Rayleigh number (Ra), natural convection is enhanced with growing Nusselt number (Nu). Moreover, panel slope tilting angle (theta) highly determines inside heat transfer subregions in terms of the vertical temperature gradient declines with rising theta, improving the temperature distribution uniformity inside. The solar greenhouse example illustrates that with the increasing numbers of panel group numbers (n), the air temperature gradient differences decrease, improving the temperature distribution uniformity inside, which is preferable to built environment accurate control for greenhouse in the practical engineering. This work can provide modeling method support and reference for natural heat convection applications.

AB Density functional theory calculations are performed to analyze the structure and stability of Cu and Cu-K clusters with 3 to 9 atoms. The results indicate that the stability of the clusters decreases after doping with a K atom. With the increase of cluster size, the stability of the clusters shows odd-even alternation. Cu-8 and Cu7K clusters exhibit the highest stability. Next, different adsorption sites are considered to investigate the geometry of CunNO and Cun-1KNO clusters. By calculating the adsorption energy and the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, it is determined that both types of reactions are exothermic processes, indicating stable adsorption of NO. Notably, the CunK clusters are more active (stronger adsorption) for NO than the Cu-n clusters. The most chemically active clusters among CunNO and Cun-1KNO clusters are Cu8NO and Cu7KNO clusters. Finally, electron transfer and Mayer bond order analysis of Cu8NO and Cu7KNO clusters reveal that the NO bond order decreases due to electron transfer when Cu/Cu-K clusters adsorb NO. In this process, the N atom is the electron donor and the Cu atom is the electron acceptor. Fundamental insights obtained in this study can be useful in the design of Cu/Cu-K catalysts.

AB Background: Rhoptry organelle proteins (ROPs) secreted by apicomplexan parasites play important roles during parasites invasion and survival in host cells, and are potential vaccine candidates against apicomplexan diseases. Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) is one of the most noteworthy apicomplexan species, which causes hemorrhagic pathologies. Although dozens of putative E. tenella ROP sequences are annotated, most ROP proteins are not well studied.Methods: In this study, an E. tenella ROP21 gene was identified and the recombinant EtROP21 protein (rEtROP21) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The developmental expression levels, localization, and protective efficacy against E. tenella infection in chickens were studied.Results: An EtROP21 gene fragment with an open reading frame (ORF) of 981 bp was obtained from the Beijing strain of E. tenella. The rEtROP21 has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa and was recognized by rEtROP21-immunized mouse serum. Two specific protein bands, about 43 KDa and 95 KDa in size, were detected in the whole sporozoite proteins using the rEtROP21-immunized chicken serum. RT-qPCR analysis of the E. tenella ROP21 gene (EtROP21) revealed that its mRNA levels were higher in merozoites and sporozoites than in sporulated and unsporulated oocysts. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron analyses showed that the EtROP21 protein predominantly localizes in the bulb region of rhoptries distributed at anterior, posterior, and perinuclear regions of E. tenella sporozoites. Immunization and challenge experiments revealed that immunizing chickens with rEtROP21 significantly increased their average body weight gain while decreasing mean lesion score and oocyst output (P <0.05). When compared with the challenged control group, the rEtROP21-immunized group was associated with a significantly higher relative weight gain (90.2%) and a greater reduction in oocyst output (67%) (P <0.05). The anticoccidial index of the rEtROP21-immunized group was 163.2. Chicken serum ELISA revealed that the levels of the specific anti- rEtROP21 antibody, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 were significantly higher in the rEtROP21-immunized group than in the challenged control group (P <0.05).Conclusion: These results indicate that rEtROP21 can induce a high level of specific immune response and it is a potential candidate for the development of vaccines against E. tenella infection in chickens.

AB This study reports the application of KBiO3 as both an excellent photocatalyst and an effective adsorbent for the removal of crystal violet dye (CV) from wastewater. CV was rapidly adsorbed from water at a removal rate higher than 90% within 60 min by following the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models. The captured CV was then completely photodecomposed in the adsorption and subsequent photocatalytic regeneration phases, thus resulting in an effective adsorption capacity regeneration of KBiO3. This proposed photodegradation-assisted adsorption reveals the efficiency of combining adsorption and photodegradation processes in the treatment of wastewater as it does not require secondary treatment of the organic pollutants, has a low cost, and is environmentally friendly.

ID SENSOR NETWORK LOCALIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; RELAXATION
AB Distributed localization is an attractive approach for large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, conventional distributed localization methods suffer from several issues, such as dividing the WSN into nonoverlapping subregions and resorting to complicated algorithms such as semi-definite programming (SDP) or second-order cone programming (SOCP). These methods often lead to lower localization accuracy for nodes far from the subregion center. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a distributed iterative node localization method that uses an advanced K-Means++ partition algorithm to divide the WSN into multiple overlapping subregions. Within each subregion, an iterative approximate algorithm is used to solve the local localization problem, which is much more efficient than SDP and SOCP. Finally, a weighted fusion strategy is designed to refine the positioning of the nodes in the overlapping subregions. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher and more robust localization accuracy in large-scale WSNs compared with existing methods.

A replicating-defective recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (HAd5), carrying a fusion protein of BPIV3 genotype C (HAd5-F), was constructed and evaluated for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. After intramuscular injection with the HAd5-F, the IgG titers against F proteins increased to 1:102,400, and virus-neutralizing titers increased to 1:256, significantly higher than those in the group injected with inactivated BPIV3C in mice (p<0.05). The splenic CD4(+)/CD8(+)T lymphocytes and IFN-gamma(+)/IL-4(+) cytokine percentages were more significant in the HAd5-F group than those in the control group. A BPIV3C challenge in a mouse model was used to assess protective efficacy of the HAd5-F. The viral loads in the lungs and tracheas of mice immunized with the HAd5-F were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.0001). There were no significant histopathological alterations in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the HAd5-F. These findings suggested that the HAd5-F elicited excellent immunity against BPIV3C infection.

ID CHAOTIC SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION; STABILITY
AB This paper addresses the generalized dissipative problem for fuzzy systems with memory sampled-data control. The aim is to devise the memory sampled-data controller such that the considered system is generalized dissipative. By considering the time derivative of the membership functions and some helpful terms, an improved time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to commendably capture the useful information about the real sampling pattern. Together with some new inequalities and the upper bounds of the time derivative of the membership functions, some new criteria are established to guarantee the fuzzy systems to be generalized dissipative. Moreover, the memory sampled-data controller is devised to include delayed state information with the common sampled-data proportional controller as its special case, which can improve the controller performance. Finally, the merits of the proposed results are demonstrated by the truck-trailer system and Rossler's system.

AB Natural convection in cavity with built-in plates has been widely used in fluid mechanics and heat transfer engineering, such as heat exchangers, electronics, solar collector, growing crystals, etc. However, the natural convection flow physics and heat transfer characteristics in cavity with plate arrays remain to be investigated further. In this study, numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics simulation are conducted for natural convection in cavity with plate arrays by finite volume method. Key influence factors impacting heat transfer are analyzed, including the line dip-angle of plate arrays theta, rotary angle of plates to the array phi, with relationships comparison between the Nusselt number and Rayleigh number in different built-in plate arrays. Moreover, for illustrative application example, the natural convection in solar greenhouse with PV arrays roof is investigated, with inside temperature distribution comparison under different design parameters. The preliminary results indicate that plates spacing could remarkably impacts the number of streamlines between "late'arrays. The dip-angle of arrays theta leads to different shape flow in the cavity, and the rotary angle of plates phi notably affects the fluid flow direction in the vicinity areas of plates, especially when phi = 90 degrees. Solar greenhouse case study indicates that increasing array group numbers can improve air temperature distribution uniformity in the cavity, which is favorable for built environment accurate control and operation. This work can provide modeling method support and reference for natural heat convection applications.

AB The strong reciprocal ratio consensus problem of modified second-order discrete-time multi -agent systems (DTMASs) with periodically time-varying topologies is investigated. The strong reciprocal ratio consensus is a new consensus and covers the strong ratio average-consensus as a special case. Modified second-order DTMAS is a variant of second-order DTMAS. A distributed control protocol is designed to achieve the strong reciprocal ratio consensus and it is the first time that ratio strategy is combined with second-order DTMASs. Furthermore, our work covers several cases where dynamically changing topologies are directed or undirected, connected or disconnected, or even mixed patterns of connected and disconnected graphs.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In 2018-2022, we investigated the presence of HEV RNA in 1233 stool samples collected in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, including humans (16), Tibetan pigs (624), yaks (312), sheep (267), and dogs (14). HEV RNA was only detected in Tibetan pig faecal samples (18.27%, 114/624). To perform molecular characterization of HEV strains in Tibetan pigs, we obtained 21 complete HEV genome sequences between 2018 and 2022. Sequence comparisons showed that 21 HEV strains from Tibetan pigs shared the mean nucleotide identities with the reference HEV strains ranging between 82.9% and 94.9% and 89.3% and 92.1% similarities with human HEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all HEV strains were genotype 4, closely related to human HEV strains. Sequence recombinant analysis showed five potential recombinant strains identified in this study, of which SWU/D18/2018 (GenBank No. MK410044) was recombinant with human and swine HEV strains, located 6509-6878 nt from the recombination point. Based on the Bayesian evolutionary trees, we found that most HEV strains diverged later than human HEV (16 Tibetan pig HEV strains diverged later than 1979, and seven human HEV strains diverged earlier than 1979). Therefore, we speculated that the prevalence of HEV 4 in Tibetan pigs possibly originated from humans in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB Forest gaps play an important role in species regeneration and forest succession. Gap size has a primary influence on tree species coexistence and community assembly along an elevation gradient. In this study, we evaluated the regeneration and coexistence of Abies faxoniana, Betula utilis, and Acer maximowiczii at different life history stages in varied gap sizes along an elevation gradient (between 3000 and 3500 m a.s.l). We found that gap size can positively enlarge the effects of elevation on the regeneration density of the three species. In the process of regeneration from seedling to sapling, Abies had stronger regeneration capability, with regeneration niche breadths of more than 0.6 in different gap sizes. A factor analysis of mixed data indicated that regeneration density, soil nutrient contents, and air humidity were mainly related to gap size, but habitat temperature was largely determined by elevation. The connection between the species regeneration density and habitat conditions was due to differences in their regeneration niches, reflecting the selective preemption of environmental resources of different species in different life stages. Microhabitat heterogeneity, controlled by the characteristics of forest gaps along an elevation, affected the regeneration niche differences of the tree species, which contributed to the species coexistence and community assembly processes.

AB Tibetan sheep are already well adapted to cold season nutrient stress on the Tibetan Plateau. Rumen, an important nutrient for metabolism and as an absorption organ in ruminants, plays a vital role in the cold stress adaptations of Tibetan sheep. Ruminal microbiota also plays an indispensable role in rumen function. In this study, combined multiomics data were utilized to comprehensively analyze the interaction mechanism between rumen epithelial miRNAs and microbiota and their metabolites in Tibetan sheep under nutrient stress in the cold season. A total of 949 miRNAs were identified in the rumen epithelium of both cold and warm seasons. A total of 62 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were screened using FC > 1.5 and p value < 0.01, and a total of 20,206 targeted genes were predicted by DE miRNAs. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that DE miRNA-targeted genes were mainly enriched in axon guidance(ko04360), tight junction(ko04530), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels(ko04750) and metabolism-related pathways. Correlation analysis revealed that rumen microbiota, rumen VFAs and DE miRNAs were all correlated. Further study revealed that the targeted genes of cold and warm season rumen epithelial DE miRNAs were coenriched with differential metabolites of microbiota in glycerophospholipid metabolism (ko00564), apoptosis (ko04210), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels (ko04750), small cell lung cancer (ko05222), and choline metabolism in cancer (ko05231) pathways. There are several interactions between Tibetan sheep rumen epithelial miRNAs, rumen microbiota, and microbial metabolites, mainly through maintaining rumen epithelial barrier function and host homeostasis of choline and cholesterol, improving host immunity, and promoting energy metabolism pathways, thus enabling Tibetan sheep to effectively respond to cold season nutrient stress. The results also suggest that rumen microbiota have coevolved with their hosts to improve the adaptive capacity of Tibetan sheep to cold season nutrient stress, providing a new perspective for the study of cold season nutritional stress adaptation in Tibetan sheep.

AB Objective: The objective of this research is to construct a method to alleviate the problem of sample imbalance in classification, especially for arrhythmia classification. This approach can improve the performance of the model without using data enhancement.Methods: In this study, we have developed a new Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) block and have used a Weight Capsule (WCapsule) network with MLP combined with sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network to classify arrhythmias. Our work is based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the original electrocardiogram (ECG) data is classified according to the criteria recommended by the American Association for Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Also, our method's performance is further evaluated.Results: The proposed model is evaluated using the inter-patient paradigm. Our proposed method shows an accuracy (ACC) of 99.88% under sample imbalance. For Class N, sensitivity (SEN) is 99.79%, positive predictive value (PPV) is 99.90%, and specificity (SPEC) is 99.19%. For Class S, SEN is 97.66%, PPV is 96.14%, and SPEC is 99.85%. For Class V, SEN is 99.97%, PPV is 99.07%, and SPEC is 99.94%. For Class F, SEN is 97.94%, PPV is 98.70%, and SPEC is 99.99%. When using only half of the training sample, our method shows that the SEN of Class N and V is 0.97% and 5.27% higher than the traditional machine learning algorithm.Conclusion: The proposed method combines MLP, weight capsule network with Seq2seq network, effectively addresses the problem of sample imbalance in arrhythmia classification, and produces good performance. Our method also shows promising potential in less samples.

AB In this experiment, MgO powder was prepared through co-precipitation using NH3 center dot H2O and NH4HCO3 as precipitant. The study aimed to investigate the effects of precipitant content and type on the yield of MgO powders. It was found that the highest MgO yield was obtained using a mixture of NH4HCO3 and NH3 center dot H2O as the precipitant. Furthermore, NH3 center dot H2O as the sole precipitant resulted in the smallest particle size. However, an increase in the precipitant content led to a decrease in the specific surface area of the powders and caused powder agglomeration. Subsequently, MgO transparent ceramics were fabricated using a hybrid sintering method involving hot pressing followed by a subsequent hot isostatic pressing treatment. The best microstructure and the highest infrared transmittance of 81% at 5.81 mu m were achieved for the MgO transparent ceramic samples hotpressed at 1500 C and then subjected to hot isostatic pressing at 1500 C-degrees. The relative density reached 99.97%.

AB The development of the four stomachs of yak is closely related to its health and performance, however the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed mRNAs of four stomachs in five growth time points [0 day, 20 days, 60 days, 15 months and 3 years (adult)] of yaks. Overall, the expression patterns of DEmRNAs were unique at 0 d, similar at 20 d and 60 d, and similar at 15 m and adult in four stomachs. The expression pattern in abomasum was markedly different from that in rumen, reticulum and omasum. Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) analysis demonstrated that multi-model spectra are drastically enriched over time in four stomachs. All the identified mRNAs in rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum were classified into 6, 4, 7, and 5 cluster profiles, respectively. Modules 9, 38, and 41 were the most significant three colored modules. By weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), a total of 5,486 genes were categorized into 10 modules. CCKBR, KCNQ1, FER1L6, and A4GNT were the hub genes of the turquoise module, and PAK6, TRIM29, ADGRF4, TGM1, and TMEM79 were the hub genes of the blue module. Furthermore, functional KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the turquoise module was involved in gastric acid secretion, sphingolipid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, etc., and the blue module was enriched in pancreatic secretion, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, etc. Our study aims to lay a molecular basis for the study of the physiological functions of rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum in yaks. It can further elucidate the important roles of these mRNAs in regulation of growth, development and metabolism in yaks, and to provide a theoretical basis for age-appropriate weaning and supplementary feeding in yaks.

AB Past climatic and topographic variations have created strong biogeographic barriers for alpine species and are key drivers of the distribution of genetic variation and population dynamics of species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Therefore, to better conserve and use germplasm resources, it is crucial to understand the distribution and differentiation of genetic variation within species. Elymus breviaristatus, an ecologically important rare grass species with strong resistance, is restricted to a limited area of the QTP. In this study, we investigated the phylogeography of E. breviaristatus using five chloroplast genes and spacer regions in natural populations distributed along the eastern QTP. We identified a total of 25 haplotypes among 216 individuals from 18 E. breviaristatus populations, which were further classified into four haplogroups based on geographical distribution and haplotype network analysis. Notably, we did not observe any signs of population expansion. High genetic diversity was exhibited at both species and population levels, with precipitation being the main limiting factor for population genetic diversity levels. Higher genetic diversity was exhibited by populations located near the Mekong-Salween Divide genetic barrier, suggesting that they may have served as a glacial refuge. The significant pattern of genetic differentiation by environmental isolation highlights the influence of heterogeneous environments on the genetic structure of E. breviaristatus populations. Additionally, the results of ecological niche models indicated that the geographic distribution of E. breviaristatus populations has decreased rapidly since the Last Glacial Maximum but is not threatened by future global warming.

AB Yak is one of the rare and unique cattle species on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which has strong adaptability to the extreme environment of the plateau. The spleens are important functional organs that enable animals to adapt to their external environment and are vital in the growth and development process. To further investigate changes in immune function during yak development, we compared the transcriptome profiles of spleen tissues among juvenile (1-day old), youth (15-months old), and prime (5-years old) yaks. Immunology of spleen development was evaluated based on histological analyses and global gene expression was examined by using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. In this work, we found 6378 genes with significant differences between the spleen of juvenile yak and youth yak, with the largest difference between groups. There were 3144 genes with significant differences between the spleen of young yak and prime yak, with the smallest differences between groups. Further, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted for the functional annotation of these genes. GO and KEGG analysis showed that some of them were related to growth, disease, immune, and metabolism. However, the genetic mechanism underlying the adaptability of yak spleens at different ages to harsh plateau environments remains unknown. These findings are important for studying the mechanisms of spleen development in yaks of different age groups.

AB The study employed density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the most stable structures of ZrAln clusters and their corresponding adsorption states. Additionally, the research aimed to investigate the reaction mechanism between water molecules and ZrAln clusters, where n ranges from 1 to 4. Regardless of whether it was a single water molecule or two water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the clusters, they were located at the vertex position of the Zr atom. The exothermicity and spontaneity of water molecules adsorption increased with the increase in the size of the clusters. The reactions between clusters and water molecules were predicted to generate hydrogen as the final product. It was observed that all clusters except for the ZrAl clusters exhibit exothermic reactions. Analysis of the IRI revealed that hydrogen produced by water molecules splitting was located on the surface of the ZrAln clusters.

TI Polarizability characteristics of twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots
   in the absence of periodic moire potential
SO RSC ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
ID BANDS
AB Recent studies have documented a rich phenomenology in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), which is significantly relevant to interlayer electronic coupling, in particular to the cases under an applied electric field. While polarizability measures the response of electrons against applied fields, this work adopts a unique strategy of decomposing global polarizability into distributional contributions to access the interlayer polarization in TBG, as a function of varying twisting angles (theta). Through the construction of a model of twisted graphene quantum dots, we assess distributional polarizability at the first-principles level. Our findings demonstrate that the polarizability perpendicular to the graphene plates can be decomposed into intralayer dipoles and interlayer charge-transfer (CT) components, the latter of which provides an explicit measurement of the interlayer coupling strength and charge transfer potential. Our analysis further reveals that interlayer polarizability dominates the polarizability variation during twisting. Intriguingly, the largest interlayer polarizability and CT driven by an external field occur in the misaligned structures with a size-dependent small angle corresponding to the first appearance of AB stacking, rather than the well-recognized Bernal structures. A derived equation is then employed to address the size dependence on the angle corresponding to the largest values in interlayer polarizability and CT. Our investigation not only characterizes the CT features in the interlayer polarizability of TBG quantum dots, but also sheds light on the existence of the strongest interlayer coupling and charge transfer at small twist angles in the presence of an external electric field, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties of graphene-based nanomaterials.

AB In this paper, two methods are applied to solve the regularized Schamel equation. Firstly, by using the singular planar dynamical system method, we discover its peakon structure which was not reported before. We also derive some new explicit traveling wave solutions of this equation, including various solitary wave solutions, periodic wave solutions and compactons. Especially, for the first time, we find the W-shape solitary wave solutions and W-shape periodic wave solutions of the equation. Then, in order to discover more wave phenomena, a deep learning framework is introduced to solve complicated initial boundary value problems of this equation. In comparison with the exact solutions given previously, our deep learning framework is reliable and highly accurate in capturing the dynamical behavior of the traveling wave solutions of the equation. As an application, we use it to solve a specific initial boundary value problem and obtain a new data-driven solution.

AB Both Eimeria tenella and Toxoplasma gondii are common apicomplexan parasites in chickens. Host cell invasion by both protozoans includes gliding motility, host cell attachment and active penetration. Chicken macrophages as phagocytic cells participate in the innate host immune response against these two parasites. In this study, primary chicken monocyte-derived macrophages (MM) were infected with both pathogens to investigate mutual and host-parasite interactions. MM cultures were assigned to groups that were infected with E. tenella, T. gondii or both. In co-infected cultures, MM were first exposed to E. tenella sporozoites for 2 h. Afterwards, T. gondii tachyzoite infection was performed. Live-cell imaging was carried out to observe cell invasion and survival of T. gondii by single parasite tracking over a period of 20 h post infection (hpi). Quantitative analysis for parasite replication was performed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Overall, the ability of T. gondii to penetrate the cell membrane of the potential host cell was reduced, although high motility was displayed. We found that T. gondii tachyzoites adhered for more than 4 h to macrophages during early co-infection. qPCR results confirmed that significantly less T. gondii entered in E. tenella-activated MM at 2 hpi, and a reduced proportion of intracellular T. gondii survived and replicated in these cells at 24 hpi. We conclude that E. tenella modulates host cell responses to another apicomplexan agent, T. gondii, reducing active invasion and multiplication in chicken primary macrophages.

AB Heterogeneity is widely considered to play a crucial role in ameliorating the cooperative dilemma problem. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of cooperative behavior in selfish groups from the perspective of heterogeneous neighbors and then propose a ranking-randomness-mechanism, where core lies in: (1) Player i removes links to potential defectors based on total payoff ranking; (2) If player i has no interactive neighbors, it randomly re-establishes links with its four nearest neighbors to avoid being isolated. Experimental data demonstrate that such a mechanism is suitable for increasing the level of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game, snowdrift dilemma game and stag-hunt game. In addition, an interesting phenomenon is that when the link re-establishment probability is not equal to zero, within a large range of payoff parameters, cooperators are always able to prevent invasion of defectors and eventually occupy the entire square network. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The issue of how to enhance cooperation has been a hot topic of research in evolutionary games for a long time. A mechanism is proposed to facilitate the cooperation behavior of evolutionary groups on networks in three game models, including prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift game, and stag hunt game. The core of the mechanism lies in: 1) Each player has a length of memory and uses the information of the elite in the memory span to update its strategy. 2) Each player has the chance to game with a certain neighbor more than once in each round. 3) The accumulative payoff of a player consists of two parts, one from playing with elites in memory length and another from playing with current neighbors, and a weight is introduced to adjust these two parts. The findings of the simulation demonstrate that a small weight can significantly enhance cooperation in three typical social dilemmas. Furthermore, the level of cooperation increases at first and then stays stable as the memory length increases.Copyright & COPY; 2023 EPLA

This article mainly analyzes the various tests of the two main tests in battery EOL testing: Battery Management System (BMS) testing and electrical testing. We propose an innovative integrated solution based on various testing items, including the reception, transmission, and self-analysis of different UDS protocol messages, a unique automated electrical performance measurement scheme, and a requirement and logic design of an integrated software end based on Python. The experimental results of actual testing show that the implementation of the integrated strategy greatly reduces the complexity of the testing steps, improves the testing efficiency, and reduces errors caused by human operation.

AB The trends exhibited by the parameters that describe the mechanical behaviour of major ampullate gland silk fibers spun by Argiope bruennichi spiders is explored by performing a series of loading-unloading tests at increasing values of strain, and by the subsequent analysis of the true stress-true strain curves obtained from these cycles. The elastic modulus, yields stress, energy absorbed, and energy dissipated in each cycle are computed in order to evaluate the evolution of these mechanical parameters with this cyclic straining. The elastic modulus is observed to increase steadily under these loading conditions, while only a moderate variation is found in the yield stress. It is also observed that a significant proportion of the energy initially absorbed in each cycle is not only dissipated, but that the material may recover partially from the associated irreversible deformation. This variation in the mechanical performance of spider silk is accounted for through a combination of irreversible and reversible deformation micromechanisms in which the viscoelasticity of the material plays a leading role.

AB Livestock grazing is among the most intensive land-use activities in grasslands, and can affect plant communities directly or indirectly via grazing-induced soil legacies. Under climate change, grasslands are threatened globally by recurrent drought. However, the extent to which drought influences grazing-induced soil legacy effects on plant biomass production and community composition remains largely unexplored. We grew five naturally co-occurring plant species (three dominants and two subordinates) in mixed communities in a glasshouse experiment in live and sterilized soil that had or had not been subjected to 19 years of grazing; these plant communities were then exposed to a subsequent drought. We tested the treatment effects on plant community biomass, proportional above-ground biomass of individual species, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal root colonization, and soil nutrient availability. Under drought-free conditions, soils from grazed plots produced significantly higher plant above-ground and total community biomass compared to soils from ungrazed plots. In contrast, plant above-ground and total community biomass were similar between grazed and ungrazed soils under drought conditions. Similarly, soils from grazed plots increased the proportional biomass of dominant species but decreased the proportion of subordinate species; however, the proportional biomass of dominant and subordinate species was similar between grazed and ungrazed soils under drought conditions. Soil NO3--N in grazed soil was significantly higher compared to ungrazed soil. Drought dramatically increased soil NO3--N in sterilized soil and had a more pronounced increase in grazed soil than in ungrazed soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal root colonization from grazed soil was lower compared to ungrazed soil. Drought significantly increased the soil available phosphorus concentration, as well as plant community AM fungal root colonization. Synthesis. Our study suggests that drought can neutralize positive grazing effects on plant community biomass production via altered plant-soil interactions. Also, we found that drought can alleviate the negative effects of grazing legacies on subordinate species by reducing competitiveness of dominant species. Our study provides new insights for understanding the underlying mechanisms of grazing effects on grassland productivity under climate change.

AB This work studies the H-8 performance of T-S fuzzy networked control systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the weight coefficient is introduced to measure the damage to the control signal caused by DoS attacks. Then, novel looped Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions are constructed based on the fuzzy membership function, and the nonlinear problem of the system is considered under the premise of reducing the initial condition constraints. Next, the issue of finding the suitable sampling period is transformed into an optimization problem of finding the optimal sampling period to reduce sampling times. An intelligent sampling controller is designed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with a truck trailer model.

AB An experimentally calibrated technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation was conducted to study P-GaN gate AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistors with gate-connected P-AlGaN field plates (PAFP-HFETs). The P-AlGaN field plates modulated the distribution of an electric field along the GaN channel, suppressed electric field crowding at the edge of the gate, and remarkably improved the breakdown voltage (BV). The PAFP-HFET with a gate-to-drain distance of L-gd = 6 mu m, showed a BV of 1560 V with an average breakdown electric field of 2.6 MV/cm. The PAFP with structural parameters of length L-p, thickness T-p, doping density N-P, and gate connected metal length L-m were optimized by the charge balance principle of the RESURF concept. The highest Baliga figure-of-merit (BFOM) of 2.4 GW/cm(2) was obtained under the conditions of T-p = 500 nm, N-p = 1 x 10(17) cm(-3), L-p = 5.8 mu m and L-m = 0.8 mu m. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics indicated that the PAFP-HFET had a lower C-oss, C-iss and C-rss than the HFET with metal field plates. Above all, the PAFP-HFET shows promise for achieving a high BFOM with conventional III-N fabrication processes.

AB The alpine forage grass species Elymus nutans Griseb. is widely distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Himalayas due to its high adaptability. However, it has become threatened by climate warming and excessive grazing. Thus, understanding its genetic and phenotypic information is crucial to aid resource management and conservation efforts. In this study, microsatellite markers were developed based on RNA-seq transcriptome data from E. nutans Griseb. varieties 'Aba' and 'Kangbei', resulting in the identification of 48,457 SSRs from 304,554 de novo assembled unigenes. Seventeen polymorphic markers, 13 inflorescence phenotypic traits, and seed shattering values were determined for 31 E. nutans accessions collected from eastern Tibet. The molecular markers generated 134 well-amplified bands with a mean Nei's genetic diversity of 0.31 and a Shannon information index of 0.46. Pairwise genetic similarity ranged from 0.554 to 0.895, with an average of 0.729. Based on the molecular marker data, all accessions were divided into two classes via the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, and the principal coordinate analysis (PCA) method. We used Tassel analysis to determine 11 loci with a significant relationship to phenotypic traits, and Pearson's correlation analysis showed that some inflorescence traits were significantly influenced by the environment. Furthermore, we detected strong patterns of isolation by both environment (IBE) and distance (IBD) via Mantel analysis. This study provides valuable insights into the genetic and phenotypic differentiation of E. nutans, informing germplasm resource evaluation and future breeding.

AB A sequential one-pot approach towards 2-(N -substituted amino)-1,4-quinones or 3-indolyl-quinones from naphthol/hydroquinone with amines or indoles, such as various (hetero)aromatic amine and aliphatic amine, has been developed. The reaction proceeds through oxidation of naphthol/hydroquinone with the CuBr2 or (NH4)2S2O8 oxidant. This reaction provides efficient access to the biologically impor-tant and synthetically useful 2-amino-quinones and 3-indolyl-quinones with good yields under mild conditions. The present protocol is simple, practical and shows good functional group tolerance. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) are widely used in consumer products and are frequently detected in water, thereby threatening public health. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of degradation of two representative OPFRs, tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), by thermally activated persulphate (PS). First, the experimental data were in accordance with the modelling simulations. In the absence of Cl- , the instantaneous concentration of SO4-center dot was 3.12 x 10(-15) M. When the concentration of Cl- increased from 7.5 mM to 450 mM, Cl-2(-)center dot became the dominant radical, with its concentration increasing from 7.39 x 10(-14) M to 7.91 x 10(-13) M. Conversely, the concentration of SO4-center dot declined from 6.3 x 10(-17) M to 2.6 x 10(-19) M. Second, owing to the transition of dominant radicals from SO4-center dot to Cl-2(-)center dot, the resultant pseudo-first-order decay rates (robs) of TCEP and TnBP were reduced. Without Cl- , robs of TCEP and TnBP were (1.8 +/- 0.1)x 10(-2) h(-1) and (6.1 +/- 0.4)x 10(-2) h(-1), respectively. When the Cl- concentration reached 450 mM, the robs of TCEP and TnBP dropped to (2.2 +/- 0.2)x 10(-3) h(-1) and (2.4 +/- 0.2)x 10(-2) h(-1), respectively. Additionally, despite the presence of oxidised Cl-2(-)center dot compounds, when Cl- participated in PS oxidation, no primary organic chlorinated byproducts were detected. These results indicated that Cl- did not affect the toxicity of TCEP and TnBP transformation intermediates. Finally, the apparent kinetic isotope effects for carbon (AKIEC) and hydrogen (AKIEH) were detected to be 1.01 and 1.370-3.049, respectively. The results implied that the C-H split occurred during the PS-activated transformation of TCEP and TnBP. The present study combines quantitative steady-state radical calculation, transformation product identification, and isotope fractionation to characterise the radical transformation of typical OPFRs, thereby laying the foundation for regulating PS oxidation to eliminate OPFRs in real-world systems.

AB Simple Summary The stomach is one of the primary sites for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Quantifying related gene expression patterns using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is conducive to further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrition metabolism in the yak stomach. The authenticity of RT-qPCR data is affected by the selection of reference genes. Unfortunately, no studies have demonstrated suitable reference genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in the yak stomach. In this study, 15 candidate reference genes (CRGs) were identified according to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results and the previous literature. Five algorithms were used to evaluate the stability of the CRGs across the entire developmental stage in the yak stomach. RPS15, MRPL39, and RPS23 were found to be the most stable genes in the yak stomach from birth to adulthood. This study indicates the appropriate reference genes for gene expression analysis via RT-qPCR in the yak stomach. Efficient nutritional assimilation and energy metabolism in the stomachs of yaks contribute to their adaption to harsh environments. Accurate gene expression profile analysis will help further reveal the molecular mechanism of nutrient and energy metabolism in the yak stomach. RT-qPCR is regarded as an accurate and dependable method for analyzing gene expression. The selection of reference genes is essential to obtain meaningful RT-qPCR results, especially in longitudinal gene expression studies of tissues and organs. Our objective was to select and validate optimal reference genes from across the transcriptome as internal controls for longitudinal gene expression studies in the yak stomach. In this study, 15 candidate reference genes (CRGs) were determined according to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results and the previous literature. The expression levels of these 15 CRGs were quantified using RT-qPCR in the yak stomach, including the rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum at five stages: 0 days, 20 days, 60 days, 15 months and three years old (adult). Subsequently, the expression stabilities of these 15 CRGs were evaluated via four algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative C-T method. Furthermore, RefFinder was employed to obtain a comprehensive ranking of the stability of CRGs. The analysis results indicate that RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 are the most stable genes in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle. In addition, to verify the reliability of the selected CRGs, the relative expression levels of HMGCS2 were quantified via RT-qPCR using the three most stable or the three least stable CRGs. Overall, we recommend combining RPS15, MRPL39 and RPS23 as reference genes for the normalization of RT-qPCR data in the yak stomach throughout the growth cycle.

AB Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) to alleviate acute liver injury (ALI). Herpetfluorenone (HPF), as an active ingredient in the dried, mature seeds Herpetospermum caudigerum Wall, used in Tibetan medicine, has been proven to effectively alleviate ALI. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether HPF can promote the differentiation of BMSCs into HLCs and promote ALI recovery. Mouse BMSCs were isolated, and the BMSCs' differentiation into HLCs was induced by HPF and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Under the induction of HPF and HGF, the expression of hepatocellular specific markers and the accumulation of glycogen and lipids in the BMSCs increased, indicating that BMSCs successfully differentiated into HLCs. Then, the ALI mouse model was established, using carbon tetrachloride, followed by an intravenous injection of BMSCs. Then, only HPF was injected intraperitoneally, in order to verify the effect of HPF in vivo. In vivo imaging was used to detect the homing ability of HPF-BMSCs, and it was detected that HPF-BMSCs significantly increased the levels of serum AST, ALT and ALP in the liver of ALI mice, and alleviated liver cell necrosis, oxidative stress and liver pathology. In conclusion, HPF can promote the differentiation of BMSCs into HLCs and promote the recovery of ALI in mice.

AB Maiwa yak is a special breed of animal living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which has great economic value, but its fertility rate is low. The corpus luteum (CL) is a temporary tissue that plays a crucial role in maintaining the physiological cycle. However, little is known about the transcriptome profile in Maiwa yak CL. In the present study, the transcriptome of Maiwa yak CL at early (EYCL), middle (MYCL) and late-stages (LYCL) was studied employing high-throughput sequencing. A total of 25,922 transcripts were identified, including 22,277 known as well as 3,645 novel ones. Furthermore, 690 and 212 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were detected in the EYCL vs. MYCL and MYCL vs. LYCL groups, respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs illustrated that the most enriched pathway was PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, twenty-six DEGs were totally found to be associated with different biological processes of CL development. One of these genes, PGRMC1, displayed a dynamical expression trend during the lifespan of yak CL. The knockdown of PGRMC1 in luteinized yak granulosa cells resulted in defective steroidogenesis. In conclusion, this study analyzed the transcriptome profiles in yak CL of different stages, and provided a novel database for analyzing the gene network in yak CL.

AB Introduction: The obesity rate of Chinese adolescents has reached an alarming level, where about 11% of Chinese children are overweight, making them more prone to diseases such as hypertension, abnormal physiological metabolism, and high joint wear of the lower limbs. This public health problem can be alleviated with healthy habits, including aerobic exercise. Objective: Study the effect of aerobic exercise on obesity and lipid metabolism in adolescents. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 40 young volunteers were equally allocated into experimental and control groups. The control group received no intervention, while the experimental group was trained according to a professionally designed aerobic exercise protocol for 28 days. Training data were recorded before, during, and after the exercises. The information was processed, compared, and analyzed. Results:The control group failed to reduce body fat effectively; an aerobic exercise in the experimental group showed better effects in reducing body weight, body fat, waist-to-hip ratio, and weight loss; compared to the control group. Immediately after the intervention, the HDL level of the experimental group showed an upward trend, while the TC, TG, and LDL indices showed a downward trend. Conclusion: Aerobic exercise can effectively increase muscle mass and basal calorie and fat intake, reducing youth obesity.

AB Background: Successful cause-related marketing (CRM) campaigns can help companies stand out from their competitors; however, CRM may not have pleasant outcomes, even if it receives substantial investment.Objective: This research aimed to investigate how gamified CRM projects influence consumers' favorability.Methods: We introduced 3 different CRM projects in 3 different studies. Every project had 2 versions according to the level of gamification, and participants were randomly assigned into these 2 groups. Additionally, we used a 2 (gamification: lower, higher) 2 (rules presentation: without visual cues, with visual cues) between-subjects design to test the moderation role of rules presentation in gamified CRM projects.Results: In Study 1, we identified that the highly gamified CRM program induces more enjoyment (F1,139=21.11, P<.001) and higher favorability (F1,139=14.57, P<.001). Moreover, we found that enjoyment played a mediation role between gamification and favorability (P<.001) in Study 2. In addition, the results of Study 3 indicated rules presentation in a gamified CRM program can moderate the indirect effect of gamification on favorability via enjoyment (index of the moderated mediation: 95% CI -1.12 to -0.10; for rules presentation with visual cues: 95% CI 0.69 to 1.40; for rules presentation without visual cues: 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83).Conclusions: Overall, this research contributes to the CRM literature and suggests gamification is an effective way of managing CRM campaigns.

Bacillus pumilus plays a certain role in promoting the growth performance and immunological indicators of animals. There are few reports about the function of goat-derived B. pumilus in animals until now. This study aimed to investigate the effects of B. pumilus fsznc-09 on growth performance and immune function of Jintang black goats. B. pumilus-treated group was fed with 1 ml freeze-dried agent of B. pumilus fsznc-09 at a concentration of 109 cfu/ml every 2 days. The growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, the expressions of muscle development and metabolism related genes of Jintang black goats were measured after 30 days. The results showed that the average daily gain and average daily feed intake were significantly increased, and feed conversion ratio was significantly decreased. The activities of total superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase, immunoglobulin G and interferon-gamma in serum of goats were significantly increased. However, the activity of malondialdehyde in serum was significantly decreased. The diameters and areas in longissimus dorsi fibre and gluteus fibre of goats were significantly decreased, while the densities in gluteus fibre of goats were significantly increased. The expressions of FAS, LPL, PPAR-., CAT, MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5 and MyHCI in longissimus dorsi and gluteus of goats were significantly improved. The expressions of TGF beta 1, SREBP-1, MyHCIIb and MyHCIIx in longissimus dorsi and gluteus of goats were significantly increased. The expressions of FN1 in longissimus dorsi and MyHCIIa in gluteus of goats were significantly decreased. In conclusion, B. pumilus fsznc-09 can effectively improve the growth performance, immunological indicators and the expressions of muscle development and metabolism related genes of Jintang black goat.

AB Objective: The focus of this study was the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 4 (STEAP4) gene, on the basis of the cloned goat STEAP4 gene sequence. Its molecular and expression characteristics were analyzed, and its influence on the differentiation of goat subcutaneous adipocytes was explored through overexpression. Method: Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to clone the goat STEAP4 sequence, and online tools were used to analyze the molecular characteristic. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression level of STEAP4 in goat tissues and subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation. Liposome transfection, BODIPY, Oil Red O staining, and qPCR were used to explore the effect of overexpression of STEAP4 on adipocyte differentiation. Results: The cloned goat STEAP4 gene sequence was 1388 bp, and the complete coding sequence (CDS) region was 1197 bp, which encoded a total of 398 amino acids. Compared with the predicted sequence (XM_005679300.3), there were three base mutations in the CDS region of goat STEAP4, A188G, T281C, and A507G. Among them, A507G changed the amino acid at position 170 from Ile to Val. Analysis of the physical and chemical properties of the protein showed that STEAP4 was a stable hydrophilic basic protein. STEAP4 gene expression level was highest in goat liver tissue (P < 0.01), followed by lung and back subcutaneous adipose tissue. STEAP4 showed different expression levels in goat subcutaneous adipocytes at different times during the induction of differentiation. The expression in the late stage of differentiation was higher than that before differentiation and lowest at 12 h (P < 0.01). Overexpression of STEAP4 promoted the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets; C/EBP beta (CCAAT enhancer binding protein) was extremely significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01), and aP2 (fatty acid binding protein) was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Overexpression of STEAP4 could promote the differentiation of goat subcutaneous preadipocytes. This study lays the foundation for an in-depth study of the role of STEAP4 in goat lipid deposition.

TI Rethinking the Dilated Encoder in TE-YOLOF: An Approach Based on
   Attention Mechanism to Improve Performance for Blood Cell Detection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES

DT Article
DE blood cell detection; TE-YOLOF; attention mechanism
AB Blood cell detection is an essential branch of microscopic imaging for disease diagnosis. TE-YOLOF is an effective model for blood cell detection, and was recently found to have an outstanding trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. However, there is a lack of understanding of whether the dilated encoder in TE-YOLOF works well for blood cell detection. To address this issue, we perform a thorough experimental analysis and find the interesting fact that the dilated encoder is not necessary for TE-YOLOF to perform the blood cell detection task. For the purpose of increasing performance on blood cell detection, in this research, we use the attention mechanism to dominate the dilated encoder place in TE-YOLOF and find that the attention mechanism is effective to address this problem. Based upon these findings, we propose a novel approach, named Enhanced Channel Attention Module (ECAM), based on attention mechanism to achieve precision improvement with less growth on model complexity. Furthermore, we examine the proposed ECAM method compared with other tip-top attention mechanisms and find that the proposed attention method is more effective on blood cell detection task. We incorporate the spatial attention mechanism in CBAM with our ECAM to form a new module, which is named Enhanced-CBAM. We propose a new network named Enhanced Channel Attention Network (ENCANet) based upon Enhanced-CBAM to perform blood cell detection on BCCD dataset. This network can increase the accuracy to 90.3 AP while the parameter is only 6.5 M. Our ENCANet is also effective for conducting cross-domain blood cell detection experiments.

AB A catalytic selective C-F bond alkylation method for polyfluoroarene with glycinates and derivatives in the presence of a DavePhos-ligated Rh catalyst was developed. This method avoids the preactivation of alkylating reagents and provides an efficient and straightforward route to synthesize a series of polyfluoroaryl amino acids via C(sp3)-H functionalization. This reaction proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits high reactivity and excellent chemoselectivities. Meanwhile, the synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by gram-scale synthesis, and further transformations proved the application value of the products as well.

AB The aims of this study were to analyse the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 11 (PPP1R11) expression and cellular localization in yak follicles and investigate its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and oestrogen secretion in granulosa cells (GCs). Ten healthy and non-pregnant female yaks (4-year-old) were used as experimental animals. The mRNA relative expression level of PPP1R11 in GCs from small (<3.0 mm), medium (3.0-5.9 mm) and large (6.0-9.0 mm) follicles was detected by RT-qPCR, and the cellular localization of PPP1R11 protein was detected by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). After isolation, culture and identification of yak GCs in vitro, si-PPP1R11 and si-NC (negative control) were transfected into GCs. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the interference efficiency, and ELISA was performed to detect oestrogen concentration. Then, EdU staining and TUNEL staining were conducted to analyse cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, the oestrogen synthesis, proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes were detected by RT-qPCR after knockdown PPP1R11. The results showed that PPP1R11 is mainly located in ovarian GCs, and the expression levels of PPP1R11 in GCs from large follicles were significantly higher than that from medium and small follicles. Transfection of si-PPP1R11 into GCs could significantly inhibit the expression of PPP1R11. Interestingly, the oestrogen secretion ability and the expression level of oestrogen pathway-related genes (STAR, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and HSD17B1) were also significantly downregulated. Moreover, the proportion of positive cells was decreased, and cellular proliferation-related genes (PCNA, CCNB1 and CDC25A) were significantly downregulated after knockdown PPP1R11. However, the proportion of apoptotic cells was increased, and apoptosis-related genes (BAX, CASP3 and P53) were significantly upregulated. Taken together, this study was the first revealed the expression and cellular localization of PPP1R11 in yak follicles. Interference PPP1R11 could reduce oestrogen secretion, inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in GCs, which provided a basis for further studies on the regulatory mechanism of PPP1R11 in follicle development.

AB Recently, Rhacophorus sensu lato was divided into three genera. In addition, Rhacophorus laoshan and Zhangixalus yinggelingensis were placed in the genus Rhacophorus sensu stricto and Zhangixalus, respectively, only based on morphological characters. The research on the genus Rhacophorus sensu lato faces major challenges due to their complex interspecies relationships, and the phylogenetic status of many species are still unclear, which hampered the taxonomy and protection of these species. In this study, we investigated the molecular phylogenetic status of R. laoshan and Z. yinggelingensis using mitochondrial DNA (12S rRNA, tRNAVal, 16S rRNA and Cyt b) fragments and nuclear DNA (RAG-1, RHOD, TYR) fragments. Our results revealed that Rhacophorus laoshan is closely related to R. verrucopus, R. orlovi and R. calcaneus, and Zhangixalus yinggelingensis should indeed be placed under Zhangixalus. This research clarified the phylogenetic positions of two species within the genus Rhacophorus sensu lato, and it also has an impact on the protection and biogeographic analysis of these species.

AB Driven by the clinical demand on improving the oral bioavailability and reducing the side effects of insol-uble drug, aminoated mesoporous silica xerogel (named L/D-BPEIN-MSX) with chiral surface topology was constructed through a facile, economical, and biomimetic strategy within 2 min, and served as the carrier of indomethacin (IMC). In the synthetic process, L/D-tartaric acid (L/D-TA) self-assembled with branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) to endow chirality and synergistic promoted silica deposition, while 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) polycondensated with the silica source to form aminoated mesostructure. By premixed strategy, IMC can be in situ loaded into L/D-BPEIN-MSX with high efficiency, which then became active in circular dichroism (CD) spectra owing to induced chirality. Noteworthy, IMC-L/D-BPEIN-MSX significantly improved the release rate of IMC with multiple controlled releasemanners. That is, D-BPEIN-MSX had favorable drug release behavior which could respond to the chiral stimuli, whereas L-BPEIN-MSX exhibited advantageous chiral surface topology that was beneficial for bio-processes related to oral adsorption. Undoubtedly, they increased the bioavailability of IMC to 8-9 times, displayed good anti-inflammatory effect, and reduced the gastrointestinal irritation of IMC. In addition, L/D-BPEIN-MSX had low toxicity and irritation, and was proven to be biodegradable and bio-compatible, which could meet the requirement for biomedical applications. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Curiosity has been seen as an important driver of individual innovation. However, empirical evidence regarding the relationship between curiosity and innovation is equivocal. We draw on the situational strength perspective to develop and test a contingency model that focuses on the contextual boundary conditions of this relationship among Chinese employees. In a controlled experiment with 191 part-time MBA students, in which curiosity was examined as a state, we found that (1) the main effect of curiosity on innovative behavioral intention was insignificant; (2) authoritarian leadership and job autonomy moderated the association of curiosity with innovative behavioral intention, such that this association was positively significant under circumstances of low authoritarian leadership or high job autonomy but not under circumstances of high authoritarian leadership or low job autonomy; and (3) job autonomy functioned as a mediator for the moderating effect of authoritarian leadership. These findings were constructively replicated in a field study of 206 subordinate-supervisor dyads in which curiosity was examined as a trait and innovative behavior was rated by supervisors. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 are a family of Zn2+ and Ca2+-dependent gelatinase MMPs that regulate muscle development and disease treatment, and they are highly conservative during biological evolution. Despite increasing knowledge of MMP genes, their evolutionary mechanism for functional adaption remains unclear. Moreover, analysis of codon usage bias (CUB) is reliable to understand evolutionary associations. However, the distribution of CUB of MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes in mammals has not been revealed clearly. Multiple analytical software was used to study the genetic evolution, phylogeny, and codon usage pattern of these two genes in seven species of mammals. Results showed that the MMP-2 and MMP-9 genes have CUB. By comparing the content of synonymous codon bases amongst seven mammals, we found that MMP-2 and MMP-9 were low-expression genes in mammals with high codon conservation, and their third codon preferred the G/C base. RSCU analysis revealed that these two genes preferred codons encoding delicious amino acids. Analysing what factors influence CUB showed that the third base distributors of these two genes were C/A and C/T, and GC(3S) had a wide distribution range on the ENC plot reference curve under no selection or mutational pressure. Thus, mutational pressure is an important factor in CUB. This study revealed the usage characteristics of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene codons in different mammals and provided basic data for further study towards enhancing meat flavour, treating muscle disease, and optimizing codons.

AB Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) is a common contagious ocular disease in ruminants worldwide characterized with keratitis and conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, blindness. Recently two outbreaks of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) occurred in goats in Sichuan Province, China. To identify the causative agent responsible for these outbreaks, ocular swabs were then taken from 40 goats with IKC and 22 goats without IKC for isolation and molecular detection of mycoplasma. Mycoplasma conjunctivae-specific nested-PCR was 85.0% positive among samples from goats with IKC and 40.9% positive from goats without IKC. Nine PCR products were sequenced and showed that there was 99.6-100% sequence homology among themselves and 99.6-100% with NCBI M. conjunctivae DNA sequences from strain Goat 655, HRC/583 and HRC/581T. A total of 6 strains of M. conjunctivae were also successfully isolated. In this study, we present conclusive evidence of the presence of M. conjunctivae in Sichuan Province, southwest China. This is the first report of M. conjunctivae infection outbreaks in small ruminants in mainland of China and will be helpful for vaccine development and control of IKC in goats in this region.

AB Grazing is one of the most important management practices for grasslands. To date, most studies on how grazing affects plant diseases have focused on a single plant species, ignoring plant community characteristics and phylogeny. We used data from a 6-year yak grazing experiment (0, 1, 2, and 3 yak(s) ha( - 1) treatment) in an alpine meadow ecosystem of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, from which we tested grazing effects on foliar fungal diseases at both population and community levels. By measuring plant community variables (including richness, evenness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition) and disease severity, we evaluated the relative importance of plant community-mediated effects of yak grazing on community pathogen load with a multi-model inference approach. We found significant differences in pathogen load among different grazing treatments; we recorded the highest and lowest pathogen loads in the 1 yak ha( - 1) treatment and in the 3 yaks ha( - 1) treatment, respectively. Pielou's evenness index and community proneness (i.e., an estimate of the capacity of plant communities to support diseases) best explained variation in pathogen load, indicating that plant community-mediated effects (through evenness and proneness) of yak grazing determined pathogen load. Our study provides empirical evidence that grazing influences foliar fungal disease prevalence through plant community evenness and composition, which demonstrates the necessity of incorporating host plant community characteristics into disease load prediction frameworks.

AB A series of novel scopariusicide derivatives were designed and synthesized starting from the main diterpenoid from the aerial parts of Isodon scoparius. Sis-25 was the most effective compound among them. The potential mechanism(s) of its immunosuppressive activity in vitro, as well as its effects on delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction and imiquimod-induced dermatitis in vivo were investigated in this study. Sis-25 inhibited anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAbs, PHA or alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation without obvious cytotoxicity. Sis-25 was a highly selective inhibitor of GSK3-beta and inhibited the mTOR/p70S6K pathway but not the PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK/ ERK 1/2 and JAK3/STAT5 pathways. Furthermore, Sis-25 significantly inhibited IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-17 expression but not IL-10 expression in activated T cells. Finally, Sis-25 treatment mitigated the DNFB-induced DTH reaction and ameliorated imiquimod-induced dermatitis. In summary, Sis-25 exerted significant immunosuppressive activity by targeting GSK3 beta in vitro and in vivo. Sis-25 may guide the design of new drugs for more effective and safer treatments of autoimmune diseases and provide new insight into developing utilizations of Isodon scoparius.

AB As a native grass species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Elymus sibiricus L. plays a pivotal role in helping the development of animal husbandry and green ecological construction on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau due to its excellent ecological value and high-efficiency feed value. Despite the excellent production performance of old mangosteen, there is a shortage of available seeds of fine varieties, and it still relies on a large number of imports. Spikes are the final embodiment of seed yield, while spike characteristics are closely related to yield. The role of spike characteristics in yield structure has been paid more and more attention. Using 51 E. sibiricus germplasm resources collected in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in recent years and two main varieties, 'Qingmu No. 1' and 'Tongde,' as test materials, the differences and relationships between spike traits, spike type classification, and the seed yield per individual plant (SYP) were studied by analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple comparison, correlation analysis, grey relation and path analysis in 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. The differences in 13 spike traits and SYP among materials were extremely significant, and correlation analysis showed that there was a certain degree of correlation between traits. Path analysis showed that 13 spike traits were divided into three levels according to their indirect effects on SYP. Grey correlation analysis revealed that breeders should focus on seed length/seed width (SdL/W), 1000-kernel weight, number of spikelets (SpN), dry weight per spike (DWS), and width of spikelets (SpW) to improve SYP. Using DWS as the classification index, the test materials could be divided into different spike types, namely thin (TST), medium (MST), and heavy (HST). According to grain density, the test materials could be divided into loose (LST), semi-dense (SDST), and dense (DST) spike types. According to spike mass index (SMI), the following spike types were identified: slender (SST), well-proportioned (WST), and large (LAST). The SYP of MST, DST, and LAST was significantly higher than that of TST, LST, and SST. Generally, MST, HST, SDST, DST, WST, and LAST had common characteristics, including abundant and dense grains per spike and heavier spikes, which can be used to identify candidates for high-yield seed varieties. Collectively, the classification results were verified across two experimental years and consistent with the field performance. These results provide vital information for germplasm screening and high-yield breeding to increase seed yield in E. sibiricus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of spike type classification in E. sibiricus.

AB Currently, many people are afflicted by cerebral diseases that cause dysfunction in the brain and perturb normal daily life of people. Cerebral diseases are greatly affected by cerebral metabolism, including the anabolism and catabolism of neurotransmitters, hormones, neurotrophic molecules and other brain-specific chemicals. Natural medicines (NMs) have the advantages of low cost and low toxicity. NMs are potential treatments for cerebral diseases due to their ability to regulate cerebral metabolism. However, most NMs have low bioavailability due to their low solubility/permeability. The study is to summarize the better bioactivity, cerebral metabolism and pharmacokinetics of NMs and its advanced version. This study sums up research articles on the NMs to treat brain diseases. NMs affect cerebral metabolism and the related mechanisms are revealed. Nanotechnologies are applied to deliver NMs. Appropriate delivery systems (exosomes, nanoparticles, liposomes, lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, protein conjugation and nanosuspensions, etc.) provide better pharmacological and pharmacokinetic characteristics of NMs. The structure-based metabolic reactions and enzyme-modulated catalytic reactions related to advanced versions of NMs alter the pharmacological activities of NMs.

AB Global warming and the energy crisis are posing increasingly severe risks for the economy, ecosystems and human health. As one kind of dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide ( CO2) contributes most to global warming, while it is also considered as an abundant, nontoxic, and renewable C1 source. Thus far, transforming CO2 into high value-added chemicals through modern technologies has attracted significant attention owing to its unique advantages. It can not only alleviate human reliance on fossil resources, but also effectively weaken the greenhouse effect. It is of great help to achieve China' s " dual-carbon " goal of " carbon peak and carbon neutrality ". N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), an extremely versatile solvent and important chemical intermediate, can be synthesized by using CO2 and dimethylamine as raw materials over different catalysts. Therefore, the development of efficient catalytic systems is crucial for the transformation of CO2 into high value-added products. This article reviews the current status and progress in the synthesis of DMF with CO2 and dimethylamine with respect to reducing agents, catalytic systems as well as the reaction mechanisms of these different catalytic systems. Furthermore, we conclude the frontiers and future prospects of the catalytic synthesis of DMF from CO2 and dimethylamine, providing readers a snapshot of this field.

AB This research investigates whether the US stock volatility index (S&P 500 index) has the forecasting ability to predict the volatility of CAC index (France), DAX index (Germany), and FTSE index (the UK) by employing a multivariate heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility jump (MHAR-RV-CJ) model. Our empirical results provide consolidated comparisons using univariate and multivariate models. The in-sample results show us the US volatility will improve the long-term volatility regression coefficient. Moreover, our proposed model, the MHAR-RV-CJ model, nearly surpasses all competing models at out-of-sample forecasting, indicating that considering the multivariate DCC-GARCH information between US-France, US-Germany, and US-UK stock markets and jump component structures can help to predict individual European stock market volatility. Unsurprisingly, several forecasting evaluation tests and further analysis (high/low volatility) confirm the robustness of our results.

AB The research focuses on the application of positive psychology theory, and studies the educational utility of national films by using deep learning (DL) algorithm. As an art form leading China's film and TV industry, national films have attracted the interest of many domestic scholars. Meanwhile, researchers have employed various science and technologies to conduct in-depth research on national films to improve film artistic levels and EDU-UTL. Accordingly, this paper comprehensively studies the EDU-UTL of national films using quality learning (Q-Learning) combined with DL algorithms and educational psychology. Then, a deep Q-Learning psychological model is proposed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the CNN uses the H-hop matrix to represent each node, and each hop indicates the neighborhood information. The experiment demonstrates that CNN has a good effect on local feature acquisition, and the representation ability of the obtained nodes is also powerful. When K = 300, the psychological factor Recall of Probability Matrix Decomposition Factorization, Collaborative DL, Stack Denoising Automatic Encoder, and CNN-based deep Q-Learning algorithm is 0.35, 0.71, 0.76, and 0.78, respectively. The results suggest that CNN-based deep Q-Learning psychological model can enhance the EDU-UTL of national films and improve the efficiency of film education from the Positive Psychology perspective.

AB A microreactor (MR) with a vaporization microchamber and a sinusoidal wave microchannel was fabricated to synthesize 2-cyanopyrazine (CP) directly with an aqueous 2-methylpyrazine (MP) solution. A continuous-flow process with high space-time yield was achieved under the premise of strong exothermality of this ammoxidation reaction. The vanadium metal oxide catalysts with four different supports (alpha-Al2O3, gamma-Al2O3, ZSM-5(50), ZSM-5(80)) were evaluated by simply stacking in the wave microchannel from 350 to 540 degrees C. The process parameters (temperature, reactant ratio, and size of catalysts) were optimized with the selected CrVPO/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst, and an optimal ammoxidation process with MP conversion (X-MP) of 71.5% and CP selectivity (S-CP) of 93.7% was obtained by a volume space velocity (GHSV) of 13 081 h(-1) at 480 degrees C. Correspondingly, the space-time yield of CP (STYCP) was 1724-77 082 gCPkg(cat)(-1)h(-1), which was the highest value ever reported for this reaction. Meanwhile, the ammoxidation reaction showed a great continuoussynthesis stability of 50-h running in the microreactor with the CP yield (Y-CP) remaining 56%-68%.

AB With the prosperity of the private vehicle industry, people can envision that parking spaces will be much scarcer than ever, especially in those central business districts (CBDs). As one of the by-products of the sharing economy, shared parking allows people to rent the idle private parking spaces nearby, balancing the parking demand in different districts. However, renters need to comprehensively measure the cost and the distance between the parking space and the destination, sometimes, in which the additional constraints (e.g. time limitation) make the decision more complicated. To solve the aforementioned challenge, a Genetic Algorithm Based Dynamic Shared Parking method is proposed. Firstly, the framework of parking space sharing for private cars in CBDs is constructed. Then, the approach based on NSGA-III is designed to generate the approximately optimal solution according to current requirements and the situation of idle parking spaces. The experiments investigate the impact of different metrics to the optimization objective in detail and the results of follow-up comparisons indicate that our method effectively saves the cost in shared parking and improves the social benefits.

AB In the information age, a large volume of Tibetan document images in woodcut edition have been produced. Geometric correction for Tibetan images is the basis of document analysis and character recognition, to which the traditional methods cannot be easily applied because of the complexity and variability of page deformation. To solve the above difficulties, we propose a new geometric correction method that is different from the existing methods. Firstly, we give a generic definition of piecewise strategy for image geometric correction by taking into full consideration the difficulty of seamless joint between sub-images. Then, we provide an effective geometric correction solution for Tibetan document images in woodcut edition, and theoretically prove the condition of seamless splicing between sub-images. According to this condition, appropriate reference points are selected to partition a Tibetan document image into several sub-images, then these sub-images are corrected by projective transformation, and finally the corrected sub-images are spliced to compose a corrected Tibetan document image. Experiments were conducted on real Tibetan woodcut document images by comparing the proposed method with classical algorithms including the FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) method, the Hough method, the projection profile method and the cross correlation method. The visualized observation results and the statistical results proved that the proposed method can obtain a better correction performance, and took less than half the time of the comparison methods.

AB Bovine coccidiosis is caused by apicomplexans of the genus Eimeria and results in significant economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. Numerous anticoccidial drugs are available for the treatment of bovine Eimeria infections. However, many compounds have been on the market for decades, and multidrug resistance is commonly observed in avian Eimeria. Recent reports of anticoccidial resistance in ovine Eimeria indicate the need for a rapid and inexpensive in vitro method to assess drug efficacy against ruminant Eimeria. Currently, no such assay exists for bovine Eimeria. The aim of this study was to develop a Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell culture-qPCR model to support the development of Eimeria (E.) zuernii in laboratory settings. The established in vitro assay was applied on three field strains of E. zuernii from the western United States to identify its general suitability for a variety of field strains. Infected cells were observed microscopically and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 48 and 192 h post infection (hpi). Light microscopy observations demonstrated E. zuernii sporozoite invasion as early as 24 hpi, while confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed early meront formation by 48 hpi. Gene copy numbers displayed variations in parasite copy numbers directly after infection and over the observation period over 192 h. Based on these findings, this assay is suitable for detecting E. zuernii gene copies in MDBK cells over an experimental period of 192 h. Though total gene copy numbers did not increase over time, we conclude that this assay is a suitable for sustaining the growth and development of E. zuernii stages in vitro. This testing system will allow for further investigations of bovine Eimeria while reducing the use of animal experiments.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an important pathogen that harms cloven-hoofed animals and has caused serious losses to livestock production since its discovery. Furthermore, inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins have been thoroughly studied in tumorigenesis, differentiation and metastasis, but its role in viral infection is rarely known. In this study, three gene knockout cell lines ID1 KO, ID3 KO, ID1/3 KO were obtained based on BHK-21 cells. We found that ID1 and ID3 genes single or double knockout promote the replication of FMDV. Moreover, compared with negative control cells during virus infection, there were 551 up-regulated genes and 1222 down-regulated genes in the ID1 KO cell line; 916 up-regulated genes and 1845 downregulated genes in the ID3 KO cell line; 810 up-regulated genes and 1566 down-regulated genes in ID1/3 KO cell line. Further genes expression patterns verification results also showed a good correlation between the data of RT-qRCR and RNA-seq. These findings provide a basis for studying the relevant mechanisms between host genes and ID genes during FMDV infection.

AB Purpose By using an integrated theoretical analysis model and a practice analysis model, this study constructed an evaluation indicator system for public participation in post-disaster housing reconstruction. Design/methodology/approach This study investigated and summarised the public participation of earthquake victims in house building in Dujiangyan. A total of 16 analysis elements were proposed, including the subject and object for evaluation. A mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation model was established. Findings The implementation results indicated that this evaluation index system was objective oriented and had public policy attributes. The index can effectively reflect the diverse needs of disaster victims, address multiple social aspects and evaluate and rate public participation. Originality/value This paper proposed a mixed research method that integrates analysis processes, such as theories and practical investigation, which are the pillars of public participation evaluation. The evaluation indicators had quantitative characteristics.

AB To determine effects of timed artificial insemination (TAI) hormonal treatments on reproductive performance of gilts/sows and explore molecular mechanisms, gilts (TAI: 90; Control:149; Total: 239) and sows (TAI: 370; Control: 492) were utilized. Results indicated the estrus/farrowing rate and number of piglets born alive and weaned in the TAI group were greater than in the control group for both gilts and sows. To explore the molecular mechanism for TAI hormonal effects, the small RNA of the gilt endometrium at 16 and 25 of gestation were sampled and sequenced to determine potential functions of microRNA (MiRNA); 358 known and 142 novel MiRNAs were detected. With comparison of TAI and control groups, there were 54 differentially abundant MiRNAs, and functional analysis results indicated "binding," "protein/ion binding," and "immune response" were mostly enriched. In addition, representative MiRNAs were selected based on criteria including being regulated on both day 16 and 25 of gestation (ssc-miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-345-5p, ssc-miR-370) along with reproduction-related target genes (ssc-miR-424-5p, ssc-miR-142-5p). Furthermore, target genes of selected MiRNAs were screened, and functional enrichment of those genes also indicated that the "binding" and "immune response" were mainly enriched. Results from the present study confirmed TAI-hormonal treatments improved estrous/farrowing rate and number of piglets born alive/weaned of gilts/sows and that hormonal treatment regimens leading to behavioral estrus at timed artificial insemination in gilts results in microRNA patterns in the endometrium that are more supportive of pregnancy. Results contribute valuable information for future studies of effects of TAI hormonal treatments on pig reproductive performance.

AB Bovine parvovirus 1 (BPV1) is a causative agent of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive cattle diseases. We collected 149 yak diarrhea fecal samples from 9 farms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The samples were screened for BPV1 by PCR, and 2 samples were positive for BPV1. The complete genomes of these BPV1 isolates were sequenced successfully. The sequences of these 2 variants were both 5,515 bp in length and shared 96.5-96.8% identity with 2 previously reported BPV1 genomes (GenBank DQ335247, NC_001540). Twenty-six identical amino acid mutations were found in the 2 yak variants, including 7 amino acid substitutions in receptor-binding regions of the VP2 protein, and 5 amino acid substitutions in the NS1 protein C-terminal region that functions to activate transcription. The new genome sequences contribute to better understanding of the evolution and molecular characteristics of BPV1.

AB As the Chinese government has promulgated many renewable energy generation policies to reduce carbon emissions and stimulate the renewable energy industry, it is vital to assess the policy effectiveness and extent to which they encourage sustainable renewable energy generation. This paper focused on the most prominent and the best-performing policy mechanisms feed-in tariffs (FIT) and renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and developed a system dynamics model to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the renewable energy generation policies. The model clearly shows the complex causal relationships between the related economic and environmental factors, and the policy scenarios were simulated to indicate the future trends and illustrate the coordination processes between polices and compare the development effects. The results show that current FIT has no obvious impact on the sustainable development of renewable energy industry, while under the integrated scenario, the RPS quota growth rate and fines have a significant positive effect after the construction period. The findings also suggest that a FIT-RPS integrated renewable energy generation policy and a perfect RPS trading system should be prioritized, and the RPS quota ratios and fines should be appropriately increased. As various policies cannot be simultaneously implemented because of financial and resource limitations, the proposed system of dynamics-based analysis approach is useful to analyze policy effectiveness and long-term industry sustainability to ensure the provision of optimized policies. It can also provide guidance for similar problems in different areas as well as decision support for further renewable energy generation policy development.

TI Restrain Price Collusion in Trade-Based Supply Chain Finance
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
ID CREDIT; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION
AB Collusion can increase the transaction value among supply chain members to obtain higher loans from supply chain finance (SCF) service provider, which will bring some serious risks for SCF. However, it is difficult to be identified and restrain the SCF service provider due to its stability and hiddenness. Different SCF transaction structures will affect the profits of supply chain members from collusion. This paper develops various game models for collusion and not collusion for different SCF transaction structures and investigates the impact of SCF transaction structures on the boundary conditions of collusion. Through comparative analysis, the findings of models are as follows: (1) in a two-echelon supply chain, the supplier and retailer are more likely to conduct collusion under the sequential game than under the simultaneous game; (2) collusion in the two-echelon supply chain can obtain higher loans than that in the three-echelon supply chain, so it has more serious hidden danger; (3) in the two-echelon supply chain, collusion is easier to form than in the three-echelon SCF supply chain that has spontaneous endogenous constraints. We also develop two types of mechanisms to restrain collusion behavior from profit sharing and incomplete information perspectives. Finally, we summarize the theoretical implications and analyze the management implications through a case study.

AB The C-1/C-3 hydrocarbon gas separation characteristics of nanoporous carbon molecular sieves (CMS) are studied using DFT calculations and MD simulations. To efficiently separate the equimolar CH4/C3H8 and CH4/C3H6 gas mixtures, CNT gas transport channels are embed between the polyphenylene membranes which created structural deformation for both CNT and membrane. The adsorption and permeation of gas molecules via CMS and the effect of nanochannel density and electric field on gas selectivity are analyzed. In addition to the direct permeation, gas molecules that adsorbed on the NPG surface also making a significant contribution to the gas permeability comes from a surface mechanism. Results also uncovered that the gas selectivity is enhanced by the electric field along the + x and +y axes, whereas reduced by the electric field along the + z and -z axes. Plainly, this CMS provides a feasible way for the efficient separation of the C-1/C-3 organic gas mixtures. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sparse representation is a powerful statistical image modelling technique and has been successfully applied to image denoising. For a given patch, a non-convex non-local similarity adaptive method is adopted for sparse representation of images. First, it uses the autoregressive model to perform dictionary learning from sample patch datasets. Second, the sparse representation of an image introduces non-convex non-local self-similarity as the regularization term. In order to make better use of the sparse regularization method for image denoising, the parameters used in this study are estimated using adaptive methods. This model is more efficient and accurate, Compared with K-means singular value decomposition (KSVD) algorithm, a generalized K-means clustering method, total variation of population sparsity (GSTV) algorithm, adaptive sparse domain selection (ASDS) algorithm, forward denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNNs), a fast and flexible Convolutional Neural Network image denoising method (FFNNet) and operator-splitting algorithm to minimize the Euler elastica functional (OSEEF). Image noise-reduction experiments confirmed that using the adaptive regularization method, the results in peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual opinion are better than other algorithms.

AB Noble metal Pt with the face-centered-cubic structure is distorted to tetragonal and orthorhombic structures in order to mimic thin films grown on flexible substrates and bending. The electronic structures from the fully relativistic treatment of the kinetic terms were obtained and followed by projecting the extensive states into the localized Wannier orbitals with a minimum basis. The spin Hall conductivity (SHC) was then obtained with the help of the concept of the Berry curvature. We find that tensile strains in-plane can enhance the SHC while the compressive ones reduce the sigma(z)(xy) component of the SHC. The variation of SHC can be as large as 8.6% for every 1% of the strains. Our work shows the possibility of tuning the SHC in metals, which can be utilized in spintronic devices.

AB This paper focuses on the stochastically exponential synchronization problem for one class of neural networks with time-varying delays (TDs) and Markov jump parameters (MJPs). To derive a tighter bound of reciprocally convex quadratic terms, we provide an improved reciprocally convex combination inequality (RCCI), which includes some existing ones as its particular cases. We construct an eligible stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to capture more information about TDs, triggering signals, and MJPs. Based on a well-designed event-triggered control scheme, we derive several novel stability criteria for the underlying systems by employing the new RCCI and other analytical techniques. Finally, we present two numerical examples to show the validity of our methods.

AB The paper explores the tension between the translator and target-cultural norms, using the British missionary, Timothy Richard (1845-1919), and his translation of Looking Backward: 2000-1887 in the late Qing dynasty as a case study. The study integrates a sociological framework as proposed by Pierre Bourdieu into Descriptive Translation Studies as developed by Gideon Toury. The related concepts include 'norms,' 'habitus,' 'field,' and 'capital'. Given that the translator was a professional missionary and not a professional translator, the dynamics of the translator's habitus are connected with his professional role as a missionary and his position-taking in the broader social, cultural, and political contexts of the late Qing dynasty. The translator's translation strategy at both the macro and micro levels are analyzed and interpreted. Interpretations are based on the translator's habitus reconstructed from his early experiences and his position-taking in the broader context. The case study reveals the tension between the translator's habitus and target-cultural norms, which in turn sheds some light on the situation in which missionaries found themselves in late Qing society.

AB At present, tourism has become an important industry in the overall economic development of China, people's demand for tourism is also increasing, and most people choose tourism as a way of entertainment (luting holidays. At the same time, the ecological environment has also been widely concerned by the society, and China pays more and more attention to the ecological environment protection. if tourism economy wants to get long-term development, it must be fully combined with environmental protection. This paper mainly takes Guizhou Province in the southeast of China as the research object, analyzes and measures the coupling relationship between tourism economic development and ecological environment protection through coupling coordination model. This study selects a relevant index as the establishment standard of the main evaluation index system to make an overall evaluation of tourism economic development and ecological environment protection in Guizhou Province. From the perspective of the coupling and coordinated development of tourism economy and ecological environment in Guizhou Province, the economic development coefficient showed a straight-line upward trend from 0.1509 in 2015 to 0.9472 in 2020. From 2018-2020, the coupling and coordinated development of economy and ecological environment in Guizhou province gradually changed into a high-level coupling and high-quality coordination stage. Through the comparative analysis of the coupling and coordinated development degree coefficient of tourism economy and ecological environment in Guizhou Province, the coupling and coordinated development degree of Guizhou Province has shown an obvious upward trend since 2015, and the upward trend in the past three years is relatively stable, which indicates that there is an obvious effect between the two systems of tourism economy and ecological environment.

AB With the growth of the city's economy, its ecological environment is facing major challenges. A series of problems such as the deterioration of the ecological environment, the increase of environmental pollution, and the insufficient construction of the ecological environment threaten the sustained and coordinated development of the economy. In this paper, taking the ecological economic zone of Aba Prefecture in Western China as the research object, the coupled coordinated development model is used to evaluate the ecological environment and economic coupling coordination of Aba Prefecture from 2008 to 2017. The entropy weight method is used to determine the index weight, and the gray correlation model measurement is used to obtain the correlation and coupling of the ecological environment and the economic system, and then we can identify the main stress and constraint factors. This research shows that, from the perspective of coupling relationship, the correlation between the element layer and the index factor between the ecological environment and economic systems of Aba Prefecture in 2017 is higher than 0.59, which is a medium correlation. From the perspective of time evolution, Aba Prefecture and its counties have achieved varying degrees of progress in the ecological environment and economic coupling coordination level from 2008 to 2017, and the coupling coordination level is relatively high. Meanwhile, forecast analysis shows that the coupling and coordination level of Aba Prefecture and its counties in the next 5 years will roughly continue the development trend of 2008-2017. By 2022, all counties and districts will reach the high-quality coupling coordination category.

AB In this paper, we focus on distributionally robust chance constrained problems (DRCCPs) under general moments information sets. By convex analysis, we obtain an equivalent convex programming form for DRCCP under assumptions that the first and second order moments belong to corresponding convex and compact sets respectively. We give some examples of support functions about matrix sets to show the tractability of the equivalent convex programming and obtain the closed form solution for the worst case VaR optimization problem. Then, we present an equivalent convex programming form for DRCCP under assumptions that the first order moment set and the support subsets are convex and compact. We also give an equivalent form for distributionally robust nonlinear chance constrained problem under assumptions that the first order moment set and the support set are convex and compact. Moreover, we provide illustrative examples to show our results.

AB Underwater object detection is a hot topic in deep learning in recent years. It is difficult to quickly complete the task of object detection due to the complex underwater environment. This article presents a novel neural network architecture, namely, Feature Cascade Underwater Object Detection Network. First, the estimated weights of different scales are obtained through the key region detection module. Then in the second module, the complete segmentation image is obtained through the multiple scale segmentation method. Third, cascade multilevel weights are estimated, along with stereo segmentation, for layer by layer integration. Finally, the predicted underwater object detection results. We test our network on the URPC2017 and LABELED-FISHES-IN-THE-WILD dataset. The average accuracy of our algorithm is higher than the other algorithms in single-category and multicategory underwater object detection tasks. Especially in the fish object detection task, our network obtains an average accuracy value that reaches 93.4%.

DE Continuous integration; Test case selection; Program dependencies;
   Class-level test case selection; Method-level test case selection;
   Dynamic execution rules
AB Continuous Integration (CI) is an important practice in agile development. With the growth of integration system, running all tests to verify the quality of submitted code, is clearly uneconomical. This paper aims at selecting a proper test subset for continuous integration so as to reduce test cost as much as possible without sacrificing quality. We first propose a static test case selection framework Sapient which aims at selecting a precise test subset towards fully covering all changed code and affected code. There are four major steps: locate changes, build dependency graphs, identify related tests by searching dependency graphs, and extend tests. Based on Sapient, we then develop a class-level test case selection approach FEST and a method-level approach MEST. FEST captures the class-level dependencies, especially the hidden references, which facilitates the modeling of full dependency relations at the class level. MEST combines two dynamic execution rules (i.e., dynamic invocation in reflection and dynamic binding in inheritance) with static dependencies to support building the precise method-level dependencies. Evaluation is conducted on 18 open source projects with 261 continuous integration versions from Eclipse and Apache communities. Results show that both FEST and MEST can detect almost all faults of two baselines (i.e., actual CI testing and ClassSRTS), and find new faults compared with actual CI testing (in 25% and 26% versions) and ClassSRTS (in 18% and 27% versions) respectively. Furthermore, MEST outperforms FEST in reduced test size, fault detection efficiency and test cost, indicating method-level test case selection can be more effective than class-level selection. This study can further speed up the feedback and improve the fault detection efficiency of CI testing, and has good application prospects for the CI testing in large-scale and complex systems.

ID OPERATORS
AB In recent work a radial deformation of the Fourier transform in the setting of Clifford analysis was introduced. The key idea behind this deformation is a family of new realizations of the Lie superalgebra osp(1 vertical bar 2) in terms of a so-called radially deformed Dirac operator D depending on a deformation parameter c such that for c = 0 the classical Dirac operator is reobtained. In this paper, several versions of the Paley-Wiener theorems for this radially deformed Fourier transform are investigated, which characterize the supports of functions associated to this generalized Fourier transform in Clifford analysis.

ID TRACKING
AB Linear charge coupled device (CCD) camera has been widely used in industrial manufacturing and science research because of its capability of high-resolution digital imaging. To reduced imaging distortion caused by scanning velocity variation, a novel linear CCD variable velocity 2-D imaging approach based on adaptive image segmentation is proposed in this article. An adaptive image segmentation algorithm is presented to calculate the size of image segmentation according to variable scanning velocity. A velocity curve fitting based on discrete interpolation is designed to obtain the scanning velocity in each image segment. Then, by using scanning velocity in each segment, compensation coefficient at each segment is calculated and a cubic spline interpolation based pixel interpolation transformation algorithm is designed to obtain the whole corrected image. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented in a printed circuit board (PCB) linear CCD imaging experiments and the results demonstrated its efficiency.

AB Addressed in this study are the minimal period and stability issues of periodic switched positive systems. With the assumption that all the system matrices, delays and switching signal are periodic, it is shown that the considered switched system is also periodic with the minimal period being a divisor of the least common multiple of the periods of subsystems and switching signal, and an algorithm is presented to determine the minimal period. Then some necessary and sufficient exponential stability conditions are proposed for periodic switched positive systems. These conditions are also extended to a more general class of periodic switched systems. Finally, a numerical example with three cases is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results and reveals two interesting facts: The system matrices of periodic positive systems are unnecessarily non-negative and system delays influence system stability. These facts imply that there exist some remarkable differences between general switched positive systems and periodic switched positive systems.

AB The efficient management of ambulance routing for emergency requests is vital to save lives when a disaster occurs. Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is a kind of metaheuristic algorithms applied to deal with the problem of scheduling. This paper analyzed the motion pattern of particles in a square potential well, given the position equation of the particles by solving the Schrodinger equation and proposed the Binary Correlation QPSO Algorithm Based on Square Potential Well (BC-QSPSO). In this novel algorithm, the intrinsic cognitive link between particles' experience information and group sharing information was created by using normal Copula function. After that, the control parameters chosen strategy gives through experiments. Finally, the simulation results of the test functions show that the improved algorithms outperform the original QPSO algorithm and due to the error gradient information will not be over utilized in square potential well, the particles are easy to jump out of the local optimum, the BC-QSPSO is more suitable to solve the functions with correlative variables.

AB The qualitative and quantitative analyses of ferroelectricity temperature characterizes for (K0.48Na0.52)NbO3-1 mol%CuO-1 mol%Co2O3 (KNN-CC) lead-free piezoceramic has been systematically investigated. KNN-CC ceramic shows an asymmetric P-E loops at various temperatures, and remnant polarization (P-r) reaches the maximum at T 80 degrees C. Dynamic hysteresis characterizes indicate orthorhombic (O) to monoclinic (M) phase transition occurs round 80 degrees C. Large internal bias electric field (E-i) is attributed to defect dipoles polarization (P-D), which is difficult to orientation because of low migration rate of defects. Moreover, owing to CuO and Co2O3 additives, the space charge cluster at grain boundary confirmed by impedance spectroscopy (IS) analysis result in enlarged E-i with increasing temperature. Mechanical quality factor (Q(m) 868) of aged KNN-CC ceramic is almost doubled that of unaged one. In short, both defects and phase structure affect the temperature stability of ferroelectricity and macroscopic electrical property for KNN lead-free piezoceramics.

AB A Lotka-Volterra learning-process model was proposed by Monteiro and Notargiacomo in [Commum. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simulat. 47(2017), 416-420] to approach learning process as an interplay between understanding and doubt. They studied the stability of the boundary equilibria and gave some numerical simulations but no further discussion for bifurcations. In this paper, we study the qualitative properties of the interior equilibria and a singular line segment completely. Moreover, we discuss their bifurcations such as transcritical, pitchfork, Hopf bifurcation on isolated equilibria and transcritical bifurcation without parameters on non-isolated equilibria. Finally, we also demonstrate these analytical theory by numerical simulations.

AB Using density functional theory (DFT), we discuss the structures of neutral, anionic, cationic d(10) configuration clusters (Ga, Ge, In, Sn and Sb) and Al doping neutral, anionic, cationic d(10) configuration clusters that contain 13 atoms. By calculating, the lowest energy geometries of M-13((0, +/- 1)) and M12Al(0, +/- 1) clusters (M = Ga, Ge, In, Sn and Sb) are determined. It is found that the most stable structures of the M12Al(0, +/- 1) clusters are similar to the M-13((0, +/- 1)) clusters, except for Ga(13)(+)and Ga12Al+, In-13 and In12Al, Sn-13 and Sn12Al, and Sb-13(-) and Sb12Al-. The binding energies, electronic properties including electron affinity (VDE and AEA), ionization energies (VIP and AIP), and HOMO-LUMO gaps, natural population analysis, and magnetic moments are calculated. The calculated binding energy shows that the doping of Al atom in M-13((0, +/- 1)) clusters can enhance the stability. For electronic properties, the VDEs of M-13 and M12Al clusters are similar to the AEAs of them. The AlPs of M-13 clusters are higher than those of M12Al. Local peaks of HOMO-LUMO gaps are found at GA(13)((0, +/- 1)), In-13(+), Sn-13, Ga12Al, Sb12Al, Ge12Al+, and Sn12Al+ clusters. The magnetic moments of M12Al clusters are larger than M12Al +/- 1 clusters. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemical reaction possibility was described quantitatively for the case of nitrotriazolam preparation with 2-clonazepam by using the data of two quantum chemical reactivity indices: net electrophilicity index and Wiberg bond order. Furthermore, relevant reaction mechanism was derived from the aspect of quantum chemistry. The results show that the indices used can quantitatively explain the chemical reactivity and reaction mechanism of the nitrotriazolam preparation. To validate the universal applicability of the proposed approach, the authors continued to use the quantum chemical reactivity indices to describe some classic chemical reactions, expecting to predict major issues related to physical organic chemistry, such as new chemical reactions and their mechanisms.

AB Background: Yaks inhabit high-altitude are well-adapted to the hypoxic environments. Though. the mechanisms involved in regulatory myocardial protein expression at high-altitude were not completely understood.
   Objective: To revel the molecular mechanism of hypoxic adaptation in yak, here we have applied comparative myocardial proteomics in between yak and cattle by isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) labelling.
   Methods: To understand the systematic protein expression variations in myocardial tissues that explain the hypoxic adaptation in yak, we have performed iTRAQ analysis combined with Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Bioinformatics analysis was performed to find the association of these Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs) in different functions and pathways. Protein to protein interaction was analyzed by using STRING database.
   Results: 686 Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs) were identified in yak with respect to cattle. From which, 480 DEPs were up-regulated and 206 were down-regulated in yak. Upregulated expression of ASB4, STAT, HRG, RHO and TSP4 in yak may be associated with angiogenesis, cardiovascular development, response to pressure overload to heart and regulation of myocardial contraction in response to increased oxygen tension. The up-regulation of mitochondria! proteins, ACAD8, GPDH-M, PIPMT1, and ALDH2, may have contributed to oxidation within mitochondria, hypoxia-induced cell metabolism and protection of heart against cardiac ischemic injuries. Further, the upregulated expression of SAA1, PTX, HP and MBL2 involved in immune response potentially helpful in myocardial protection against ischemic injuries, extracellular matrix remodeling and free heme neutralization/ clearance in oxygen-deficient environment.
   Conclusion: Therefore, the identification of these myocardial proteins in will be conducive to investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in hypoxic adaptations of yaks at high-altitude condition.

ID CENTER WAVE-FUNCTION
AB The wavefunction is an important element of the multiscale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA). To verify the physical model and the multimode optimization performance of the MQHOA for multimode optimization in this paper, we define a multidimensional harmonic-Gaussian potential function. When the wavefunction of the MQHOA for multimode optimization and the probability amplitude of an ammonia molecule are compared, the ground-state wavefunction can reflect the probability distribution of the two-state ammonia molecule. We obtain the extrema of the proposed function using the Hessian matrix and optimize the proposed function with the multimode algorithm. The experiments show that the multimode algorithm can determine the extrema of the proposed function with appropriate parameters. Changes in the proposed function barriers have little effect on the optimization ability of the multimode algorithm. The optimization ability of the multimode algorithm is determined by its own wavefunction.

AB Reproduction of cattleyak was greatly restricted due to male infertility. Genomic sequencing indicated higher similarity between cattle and yak and studies were undertaken to investigate the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak on the molecular level, while there was no information available on the genetic variants of testis transcriptomes between cattleyak and yak. 'to gain insight into molecular genetic characteristics of spermatogenesis for cattleyak and yak, we investigated genetic alterations for their testis transcriptomes using RNA-seq. The total number of novel transcript units identified from cattleyak was much lower than for yak. The total number of alternative splicing (AS) events identified from cattleyak was also lower than it was in yak, among which intron retention was the prevalent type of AS and it occurred on average in 40% of all AS events in cattleyak and at an average 37% in yak. The cattleyak exhibited lower transitions than yak The transversions identified in cattleyak were also lower than in yak. The lower AS events in the testis transcriptome of cattleyak resulted in the deficiency of mRNA/protein isoforms and their critical roles in spermatogenesis, which would lead to the sperm atogenic arrest. The lower genetic polymorphisms in cattleyak could be attributed to the stagnant spermatogenic differentiation in cattleyak compared to vigorous spermatogenic differentiation in yak.

TI Non-Stationary Representation for Continuity Aware Head Pose Estimation
   Via Deep Neural Decision Trees
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Head pose estimation; convolutional neural network; neural decision
   tree; continuity; template marching based alignment
AB The problem of image-based head pose estimation attracts intensive attention due to a large number of applications such as face analysis and attention modeling. Existing methods often convert head pose estimation into the pose classification problem, but ignored the non-stationary appearance change brought about by the equally distributed bins. This paper targets the head pose estimation problem via deep neural decision trees, where the non-linear property of the representative appearance is learned together with the bin classification probability. First, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to get pose related features. Second, we apply the Fully Connected (FC) layer on the learned features to extract branch weight for each Euler angle and the representative values for each bin. Third, we employ neural decision tree on the branch weight to get bin classification probability. To explicitly characterize the relationship between the adjacent pose intervals, we embed continuity of the head angles into the tree architecture by constructing the bridge-tree. The final estimation is obtained via a weighted sum between the estimated bin probability and the representative bin values. We evaluate our methods on different public datasets including Pointing'04, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Pose, Expression, Accessory, and Lighting (CAS-PEAL) and Biwi Kinect Head Pose and find that, the proposed method outperforms as compared to state-of-the-art. Besides, we leverage the template marching based alignment for data preprocessing and demonstrate its superiority over traditional alignment methods on the task of head pose estimation.

AB Helicid is a specific Chinese natural drug. Helicid, its congeners, and its derivatives exhibit pronounced biological activities, among which its hypnotic effects stand out. The well-documented sedation and analgesic activity and low side effects of helicid have drawn more and more attention from scientists. Moreover, its clinical success and intriguing mechanism of action have stimulated great interest in further modification of helicid for improving its hypnotic activity. The 4-formyl group has been a major target for structural derivatization aimed at either producing more potent compounds or overcoming drug disadvantages. Accordingly, numerous helicid derivatives have been prepared via molecular docking and hemisynthesis. Although neither systematic nor comprehensive, there are two excellent reviews on the distribution, sources, applications, synthesis, and pharmacological activity of helicid that have been published in Chinese. In the present review, we attempt to compile and discuss the key data available in the literature on the multiple biological activities of helicid derivatives. This compilation of 102 references may be helpful in understanding the diverse biological properties of helicid while providing insights into its mechanism of action. This may direct future research in the synthesis of new derivatives and the exploration of other biological activities.

AB PGC-1 alpha has been considered as an important mediator of functional capacity of muscle. Our previous study indicated that the mRNA level of PGC-1 alpha increased in muscle during Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti) growth. To understand the biological significance of PGC-1 alpha up-regulation, S. prenanti myosatellite cells were isolated and the function of PGC-1 alpha in myoblast differentiation was further investigated. The results indicated that PGC-1 alpha over-expressing transfectants fused to form myotubes with higher mRNA level of myosin heavy chain isoform I (MyHCI). No obvious differentiation was observed in PGC-1 alpha-targeted shRNA-transfected cells with a marked decrement of MyHCI expression. Furthermore, S. prenanti PGC-1 alpha increased the expression of MyoD and MyoG, which controlled the commitment of precursor cells to myotubes. In contrast, the levels of MyoD and MyoG mRNA were down-regulated with shRNA-targeting PGC-1 alpha transfection. These investigations indicate that PGC-1 alpha is associated with myoblast differentiation and it elevates MyoD and MyoG expression levels in S. prenanti myoblast cells.

AB Large piezoelectricity (d (33)) and high Curie temeprature (T (C)) are highly expected to attain in alkaline niobate-based piezoceramics, which is of high significance in the practical applications. For the compositionally optimized composition, we achieved both large d (33) (similar to 395 pC/N) and high T (C) (similar to 342 A degrees C) in (0.995-x)K0.485Na0.485Li0.03NbO3-xBi(0.5)(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)ZrO3-0.005BiScO(3) (0 <= x ae <= 0.06) (KNNL-xBNKZ-BS) lead-free ceramics through the construction of rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary. A systematic study of the effect of phase boundary on resulting piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and strain properties in the ceramics was investigated. The KNNL-xBNKZ-BS ceramics with x = 0.04 exhibited an enhanced unipolar strain properties (strain similar to 0.161%, d (33)* similar to 402 pm/V) and thermal stability of d (33) (T (a) <= 310 A degrees C, normalized d (33) >= 84.6%), which was mainly ascribed to the R-O-T phase boundary and high T (C) respectively. Therefore, a balanced development of the parameters (e.g., d (33), T (C)) can be well realized in KNNL-xBNKZ-BS ceramics, we believe that such a material system opens a window for the practical applications.

AB The centralized controller of SDN enables a global topology view of the underlying network. It is possible for the SDN controller to achieve globally optimized resource composition and utilization, including optimized end-to-end paths. Currently, resource composition in SDN arena is usually conducted in an imperative manner where composition logics are explicitly specified in high level programming languages. It requires strong programming and OpenFlow backgrounds. This paper proposes declarative path composition, namely Compass, which offers a human-friendly user interface similar to natural language. Borrowing methodologies from Semantic Web, Compass models and stores SDN resources using OWL and RDF, respectively, to foster the virtualized and unified management of the network resources regardless of the concrete controller platform. Besides, path composition is conducted in a declarative manner where the user merely specifies the composition goal in the SPARQL query language instead of explicitly specifying concrete composition details in programming languages. Composed paths are also reused based on similarity matching, to reduce the chance of time-consuming path composition. The experiment results reflect the applicability of Compass in path composition and reuse.

AB Southwestern China has an area with unique natural conditions located in alpine regions at altitudes from 2000 to 5000m; this area is referred to as the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP). Unique animals, such as yaks (Bos grunniens), are found extensively on the plateau of Southwestern China due to its unique environment. In recent years, the prevalence of fake meat products such as fake jerky has increased in this area. This research was conducted as an attempt to develop a reliable multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) detection method for identifying nine animal species found in QTP. We developed the mPCR method using the specific sites found in 12S rRNA region of these nine species, which was effective in discriminating between the nine species and was successful in terms of validated reproducibility, detection limit (<6 pg total DNA), discrimination of mixed samples, and specificity (approximately 99%) using real meat samples. Our results show that the mPCR detection method can overcome the limitations of prior detection methods, such as restriction fragment length polymorphism or high-resolution melting analysis methods.

AB A novel input-output linearization algorithm-based inter-area oscillation damping control strategy for the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is proposed in this paper. The dynamic model of the study system, a classical two-area power system for inter-area oscillation study integrated with a DFIG-based wind farm, is modeled first. Then, the suitable input and output variables are chosen according to the control objective, which are the variables need to be linearized. The feedback control law, which can linearize the selected system input to system output, is obtained via the Lie derivative of the output function and state function according to the input-output linearization algorithm. Therefore, the control parameters can be designed to utilize the linear system control algorithm to improve the system dynamic response. The proposed control strategy can deal with the nonlinearity existing in the damping control loop, and thus the performance of the damping control can be improved. The simulation carried on the MATLAB/Simulink platform was employed to investigate the performance of the proposed damping control strategy for DFIG. Simulation results are compared with those of a system with no additional damping controller and with a conditional damping controller. It shows that proposed method can improve the system damping obviously. Compared to the conventional power system stabilizer (PSS) control, the proposed damping controller can damp the swing in power more quickly. (c) 2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB We investigate the spectrum fragmentation issue in flex-grid optical networks and propose a minimum-blockgenerated flexible-grouping-based spectrum assignment algorithm. By dividing the spectrum resources into several flexible groups according to the bandwidth requirements of service requests for their accommodation and minimizing the generated isolated spectrum blocks inside each spectrum group, the proposed algorithm can not only reduce spectrum fragments but also enhance networking performance (e.g. blocking probability) due to the improved spectrum contiguity inside each spectrum group with no traffic disruption or any extra components. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can remarkably reduce spectrum fragments with a low blocking probability.

AB Reactive power modulation of wind power plants is an effective way to damp inter-area oscillation in wind power penetrated power systems. For doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind farms, there are two different ways to achieve reactive power modulation: one is via reactive power feedback control, and the other method is via voltage feedback control. While both of the control schemes are feasible, their effectiveness may differ, and there has not been a systematic comparison between them. This paper investigates the differences between these two feedback schemes for inter-area oscillation damping control. The principles of utilizing DFIG for damping control is introduced at first. Then, analytical techniques including the frequency domain analysis, mu-analysis and time domain analysis are used to systematically study the performance of the two control schemes against inter-area oscillation. The robustness of the control schemes with respect to the variety of system operation points is also studied. The results from this paper can provide an insight into the understatement of DFIG reactive modulation against oscillation and guidance for controller design.

DT Article
ID SALIENT CONTOURS; INTEGRATION; INHIBITION; MODEL; EXTRACTION
AB Recently, many image processing applications have taken advantage of a psychophysical and neurophysiological mechanism, called "surround suppression" to extract object contour from a natural scene. However, these traditional methods often adopt a single suppression model and a fixed input parameter called "inhibition level", which needs to be manually specified. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel model, called "context-adaptive surround suppression", which can automatically control the effect of surround suppression according to image local contextual features measured by a surface estimator based on a local linear kernel. Moreover, a dynamic suppression method and its stopping mechanism are introduced to avoid manual intervention. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated and validated by a broad range of experimental results.

By employing the method of Lyapunov function, several criteria of finite-gain L-infinity stability from disturbance to output are established. It is shown that a linear delay differential system can be finite-gain L-infinity stabilised from disturbance to output using impulsive feedback control even there is an unstable matrix. Moreover, delay differential equations also maybe finite-gain L-infinity stable from disturbance to output under an appropriate sequence of impulses treated as disturbances. Two examples and simulations are also given to illustrate our results.

AB Well-crystallized olivine-structure LiFePO4/C composite was synthesized by a wet milling-assisted spray drying using cheap Fe3O4 as iron source. The composite exhibited bowl-like secondary particles that are mainly constructed of numerous carbon coated nanoparticles. Such a composite possesses a porous structure with an average pore size of 8.14 nm and a high BET surface area of 50.57 m(2) g(-1). Electrochemical tests revealed that the cathode material exhibited a high rate capability (84 mA h g(-1) at 90 C) and good cycle stability (93% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 10 C). That is because the uniform carbon coating increased the electronic conductivity, while, large specific surface area, porous structure, and nano-sized particles greatly favored the electrolyte accessibility and rapid Li+ transport.

AB Male and female show significant differences in important behavioral features such as shyness, yet the neural substrates of these differences remain poorly understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that both shyness and social anxiety in healthy subjects are associated with increased activation in the fronto-limbic and cognitive control areas. However, it remains unknown whether these brain abnormalities would be shared by different genders. Therefore, in the current study, we used resting-state fMRI (r-fMRI) to investigate sex differences in intrinsic cerebral activity that may contribute to shyness and social anxiety. Sixty subjects (28 males, 32 females) participated in r-fMRI scans, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were used to measure the spontaneous regional cerebral activity in all subjects. We first compared the differences between male and female both in the ALFF and fALFF and then we also examined the whole brain correlation between the ALFF/fALFF and the severity of shyness as well as social anxiety by genders. Referring to shyness measure, we found a significant positive correlation between shyness scores (CBSS) and ALFF/fALFF value in the frontoparietal control network and a negative correlation in the cingulo-insular network in female; while in male, there is no such correlation. For the social anxiety level, we found positive correlations between Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) scores and spontaneous activity in the frontal-limbic network in male and negative correlation between the frontal-parietal network; however, such correlation was not prominent in female. This pattern suggests that shy female individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by a positive association with activity in frontoparietal network and negative association in cingulo-insular network, whereas social anxiety males relied more on a reactive control process, driven by a positive correlation of frontal-limbic network and negative correlation of frontoparietal network. Our results reveal that shyness or social anxiety is associated with disrupted spontaneous brain activity patterns and that these patterns are influenced by sex.

By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and a novel integral inequality, which gives a tighter upper bound than Jensen's inequality and Bessel-Legendre inequality, some sufficient conditions are established and desired feedback controllers are designed in terms of the solution to certain LMIs. Compared with the existing results, the obtained criteria are more effective due to the tuning scalars and free-weighting matrices. Numerical examples and their simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE MICF; centripetal spherical pinch; beam-target enhancement
AB Based on the similarity in models of the early Sun and the 3-D common focal region of the micro-pinch in X-pinch experiments, a novel hybrid fusion configuration by continuous focusing of multiple Z-pinched plasma beams on spatially symmetric plasma is proposed. By replacing gravity with Lorentz force with subsequent centripetal spherical pinch, the beam target fusion reactivity is enhanced in a quasi-spherical converging region, thus achieving MICF. An assessment, presented here, suggests that a practical fusion power source could be achieved using deuterium alone. Plasma instabilities can be suppressed by fast rotation resulting from an asymmetric tangential torsion in the spherical focal region of this configuration. Mathematical equivalence with the Sun allows the development of appropriate equations for the focal region of MICF, which are solved numerically to provide density, temperature and pressure distributions that produce net fusion energy output. An analysis of MICF physics and a preliminary experimental demonstration of a single beam are also carried out.

TI Carbon coated titanium electrode for the electrolytic decoloration of

   Decoloration
AB Electrolysis is widely adopted in water treatment. The major challenge of electrolysis technology focuses on developing better electrode materials. In this study, we reported that the hydrothermal coating of titanium electrode with carbon (C-Ti electrode) could significantly improve the decoloration performance of Ti electrode. The decoloration kinetics of C-Ti electrode was much faster than that of naked Ti electrode at the same current density. The presence of chloride electrolytes, e.g. NaCl and KCl, was crucial for the efficient electrolysis. The optimized pH for C-Ti electrode was pH 7. Beyond methylene blue, C-Ti electrode showed high decoloration performance for other dyes, such as congo red, acidic blue 92 and remazol brilliant blue R. Mechanistically, the electrolytic oxidation of MB was mainly via indirect pathway, where Cl- was oxidized into ClO- for the oxidation of other substances. Moreover, the performance of C-Ti electrode largely remained in the recycling evaluations. The implication to the applications of C-Ti electrode in water treatment is discussed.

AB Lactate dehydrogenase C4 (LDH-C4) is considered to be a target protein for the development of contraceptives. In this work, the characterization of plateau zokor LDH-C4 and the screening of a series of N-substituted oxamic acids as inhibitors against zokor LDH-C4 were reported. The cDNA of zokor LDH-C gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, from which the protein was purified and further characterized. The protein was a tetramer (LDH-C4) and thermally stable up to 62 A degrees C with a K (m) of 63.9 mu M for pyruvate and with optimal pH values of 7.95 and 10.1 for the forward and backward reactions respectively. Virtual and in vitro screening against zokor LDH-C4 revealed eight N-substituted oxamic acids with IC50s ranging from 198 to 2513 mu M, higher than that of oxamic acid (150 mu M) and (ethylamino)(oxo)acetic acid (59 mu M). The inhibition potencies of N-substituted oxamic acids tested are in the micromolar range, and the increase in the length of substituting chain seems not to increase inhibition potency.

AB In this study, liquid crystal (LC) was used to study the interactions of alkyl polyglycosides (APG) with gelatin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) at the LC-aqueous interface. The LC easily undergo an orientational transition from a homeotropic to a planar state after proteins were in contact to the LC aqueous interface decorated with APG, thus inducing an optical change from dark to bright. The optical image analysis reveals that the rearrangement rate of APG monolayer is tightly dependent on the concentration and chemical structure of the protein of interest. For example, the rearrangement rate of APG monolayer increases with an increasing gelatin concentration. We also find that the chemical structure of the proteins has a significant impact on the difference in the growth behavior of bright domains in LC.

In order to discuss the generalized TV image restoration with solution-driven adaptivity, we consider the existence and uniqueness of the solution for mixed quasi-variational inequality. Moreover, the convergence of a modified projection algorithm for solving mixed quasi-variational inequalities is also shown. The corresponding experimental results support our theoretical findings.

AB Transition metal (TM = Cu, Ni, Mn, Fe and Co)-doped ZnO:F thin films are deposited on glass substrates by a sol-gel method through using ethanol as solvent. All the samples are checked by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), photoluminescence, UV spectrophotometer, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The XRD reveals that Cu, Ni, Mn, Fe and Co occupy the Zn sites successfully without changing the wurtzite structure of ZnO at moderate doping concentration, and no evidence of any secondary phases is found. The AFM measurements show that the average values of crystallite surface roughness of the samples are in a range from about 2 to 12.7 nm. The surface of ZnO:F thin film becomes less compact and uniform when ZnO: F thin film is doped with TM ions. The TM ions are indeed substituted at the Zn2+ site into the ZnO lattice as shown in the results obtained by XPS and XRD. Further studies show that most of the ZnO films exhibit preferred (002) orientations, while the best c-axis orientation occurs in Zn0.93Co0.05F0.02O film. However, the crystalline quality and preferential orientation of ZnO film become poor in Zn0.93Co0.05F0.02O. The optical bandgaps of all the ZnO:F films decrease after doping TM. All the samples show high transmittance values in the visible region. Strong ultraviolet emission and weak blue emission are observed in the photoluminescence spectra measured at room temperature for all the samples. The Zn0.93Co0.05F0.02O film shows the weakest ultraviolet emission peak and strongest blue emission peak, corresponding to the strongest ferromagnetism; while for the Zn0.93Co0.05F0.02O film, the strongest ultraviolet emission peak and weakest blue emission peak are observed, accompanied by the weakest ferromagnetism. To determine the optical bandgap (E-g) of TM-doped ZnO:F thin film, we plot the curve of (alpha hv)(2) versus photon energy (hv). It is found that the E-g decreases from 3.16 eV to 3.01 eV with the TM ions doping. We show the variations of saturation magnetization with the VO concentration for TM -doped ZnO:F thin films with the different transition metal ions. In the case of Cu-doped ZnO:F thin films, the ZnO sample shows that a weaker magnetism. ZnMnFO film exhibits well-defined hysteresis with a coercive field of 7.28 x 10(5) emu/g. Further studies reveal that these interesting magnetic properties are correlated with the defect-related model for ferromagnetism. Our results will expand the applications of ZnO:F thin films in visible light emitting diode, photovoltaic devices, photoelectrochromic devices, etc. Meanwhile, extreme cares should be taken to control the codoping of ZnO:F thin films for tuning the magnetization.

AB Dyeing and re-tanning properties of nine aldehyde reactive dyes synthesized in our previous work were studied using aluminum pretanned wet-white sheep leather as a substrate. Their washing fastness and four dyeing property indexes, i.e., substantivity (S), exhaustion (E), reactivity (R) and fixation (F) were measured. The relationship between the color-matching effect and the relative difference values of the four dyeing property indexes of the combined dyes were investigated, and the simultaneous tanning-dyeing property of reactive dyes with a glutaraldehyde backbone were tested. The results were as follows: (1) The synthesized aldehyde reactive dyes could dye wet-white leather under mild conditions (T = 35-45 degrees C, pH =4.0-6.5) within 1.5 h, and the dyed leather possessed a satisfactory washing-fastness. (2) Reactive dyes with a glutaraldehyde backbone had better dyeing performance than mono-aldehyde reactive dyes. (3) The less the relative difference value of the dyeing property indexes of the combined dyes, the better was the color-matching effect. (4) The tested reactive dyes with a glutaraldehyde backbone increased the T, of wet-white leather to 11-17 degrees C in addition to dyeing it to the corresponding color.

AB This paper is concerned with solving a stochastic variational inequality problem (for short, SVIP) from a viewpoint of minimization of mixed conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). The regularized gap function for SVIP is used to define a loss function for the SVIP and mixed CVaR to measure the loss. In this setting, SVIP can be reformulated as a deterministic minimization problem. We show that the reformulation is a convex program for a huge class of SVIP under suitable conditions. Since mixed CVaR involves the plus function and mathematical expectation, the neural network smoothing function and Monte Carlo method are employed to get an approximation problem of the minimization reformulation. Finally, we consider the convergence of optimal solutions and stationary points of the approximation.

ID LASER DAMAGE RESISTANCE
AB A finite-difference time-domain algorithm was applied to solve Maxwell's equations to obtain the redistribution of an electromagnetic plane wave in the vicinity of a trailing indent crack (TIC). The roles of five geometrical parameters playing in light intensification were calculated numerically under the irradiation of a 355-nm normal incidence laser. The results show that the light intensity enhancements between the nearest neighbor pits were remarkable, which may lead to damage. The calculated results reveal that the light intensity enhancement factor (LIEF) can be up to 11.2 when TIC is on the rear-surface. With the increase of the length as well as the depth of pits, LIEF increased. Conversely, with the increase of the axis of pits, LIEF gradually declined to a stable status. It was observed that there exists an optima width or gap, which enables LIEF to be increased dramatically and then decreased gently. By comparison, results suggest that the worst cases occur when the depth and the length are both very large, especially if the width equals to 2 lambda and the gap equals the width. This work provides a recommended theoretical criterion for defect inspection and classification.

AB River-lake connecting system (RLCS) plays an important role in controlling lake eutrophication due to its special geographical position and ecological significance. In addition, the pattern of phytoplankton variation and interaction between chlorophyll a and environmental variables are important for eutrophication management. To understand general water environment characteristics, including relationships between chlorophyll a and environmental variables in the Taige Canal-Taihu Lake system, a comparative study was conducted based on a two-year-long field investigation. This system was divided into a river region and a lake region based on cluster analysis. Investigated field data in the two regions were analyzed separately with principal component analysis (PCA) and stepwise multiple regressions for the relationships among water quality parameters. The spatial variation between the two regions can be found both in patterns of water quality parameters and relationships among them. Multivariate analysis showed that total phosphorous, chlorophyll a, and transparency were the main indicators of the spatial variations between the two regions. Relationships among water quality parameters showed that temperature and transparency were the primary environmental factors limiting phytoplanIcton growth in the river region. However, in the lake region phytoplankton may uptake phosphorus from sediments and its growth was limited by nitrogen during high-temperature seasons. Based on these characteristics, we suggested that reduction of nitrogen input and control of internal phosphorous loading was important for management of eutrophication in the studied area.

AB To study the characteristics of the coupling vibration between a maglev vehicle and its track beam system and to improve the performance of the levitation system, a new type of vibration test bench was developed. Take a single maglev frame as the study object; simulation of the coupling vibration of the maglev vehicle, levitation system, and track beam were achieved. In addition, all types of real track irregularity excitations can be simulated using hydraulic actuators of the test bench. To expand the research scope, a simulationmodel was developed that can conduct the simulation research synergistically with the test bench. Based on a dynamics model of the test bench, the dynamics simulation method determined the influence on the levitation control performance of three factors: the track beam support stiffness, the track beam mass, and the track irregularity. The vibration resonance phenomenon of the vehicle/track system was reproduced by the dynamics simulation, and a portion of the simulation results were validated by the test results. By combining the test bench and the dynamics model, experiments can be guided by the simulation results, and the experimental results can validate the dynamics simulation results.

AB Sour meat, a traditional fermented meat product, derives its unique attributes from the flavors developed during the fermentation process. This study systematically investigated the dynamic changes in volatile compounds and bacterial succession in pork sour meat during fermentation (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) using a combination of an electric nose (E-nose), an electric tongue (E-tongue), gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The results showed that the E-nose and E-tongue effectively distinguished samples across fermentation stages. The pork sour meat was analyzed using GC-IMS and GC-MS, which identified 39 and 81 volatile compounds (VOCs), respectively, primarily esters, alcohols, and aldehydes, with esters being most abundant after 45 days of fermentation. A total of 18 and 25 volatile compounds, respectively, were identified by GC-IMS and GC-MS as differential VOCs (p < 0.05, VIP > 1) of the pork sour meat. alpha-diversity increased in both species' richness and diversity over the course of fermentation, while beta-diversity analysis further differentiated samples across stages. Firmicutes dominated the bacterial community, with Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, and Weissella as the main genera. Pearson correlation analysis revealed distinct associations between bacteria and volatiles: Staphylococcus was positively associated with butyl acetate-D, ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, dihydroactinidiolide, and (E)-2-heptenal, while Lactobacillus and Weissella were positively associated with acetic acid. Additionally, Weissella showed positive correlations with eight volatile compounds: acetic acid, nonanal, benzyl alcohol, ethyl crotonate, isoamyl acetate, dihydroactinidiolide, octanal, and ethyl acetate. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of volatile compound evolution and bacterial succession in pork sour meat, thereby offering a scientific basis for understanding and regulating its flavor quality.

AB Forest monitoring plays a crucial role in the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources, with tree crown delineation being a key task for assessing forest structure and tree health. This study presents a novel framework, FM-SAM, integrating YOLOv10 and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise tree crown segmentation and species identification in UAV imagery. The framework combines YOLOv10's real-time detection capabilities with SAM's strong segmentation, significantly improving segmentation and classification accuracy. SAM is also employed as a semi-supervised branch in FM-SAM to expedite the annotation process, offering a solution that reduces the need for extensive manual labeling. Experimental results on the MixedForestDataset, comprising both coniferous and broadleaf tree species, demonstrate that FM-SAM outperforms traditional deep learning frameworks such as DeepLabv3 and YOLO-based models, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall values. The proposed method excels in complex forest environments, enhancing the effectiveness of tree crown delineation and classification for large-scale forest monitoring applications.

AB Aconitum species, distributed across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, possess significant medicinal and economic value. However, their conservation remains inadequately understood, particularly in the context of ongoing and future climate change. This study assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of 14 Aconitum species by integrating ecological niche modeling with conservation planning. Using 846 occurrence records and 16 environmental variables, we applied an optimized maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and the ensemble biomod2 framework to predict potential habitat suitability across 18 Mid-Holocene (MH), present, and future climate scenarios. Our results revealed that biomod2 outperformed MaxEnt in prediction accuracy. Isothermality (BIO3) emerged as the most influential environmental predictor. Most species exhibited range expansion from the MH to the present and underwent dynamic shifts under future climate projections, both expansions and contractions. A consistent northward and upward (high-elevation) migration trend was observed across scenarios. Ecological niche indices also increased under present and future climates relative to the MH, suggesting altered niche breadths in response to environmental change. Despite these shifts, all species were assigned a medium priority (MP) conservation status. Threat assessments categorized 11 species as endangered (EN) and three as vulnerable (VU). Importantly, areas of the highest species richness, particularly the Hengduan Mountains, remain underrepresented in the current protected area network. These findings underscore the urgent need for expanding conservation efforts and protected areas in biodiversity hotspots. By elucidating the climate-driven distributional responses of Aconitum species, this study provides a critical foundation for the future conservation and sustainable management of these valuable medicinal resources on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Background: UC-MSC-Exos (umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes) offer a potential therapy for captive giant pandas. This study aimed to clarify their proteomic and miRNA profiles and functions to understand therapeutic mechanisms and optimize their application.Methods: UC-MSC-Exos were isolated from giant panda UC-MSC culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation. Proteomic and miRNA profiles were identified by mass spectrometry and high-throughput small RNA sequencing, respectively. Dual-luciferase gene reporter assays were used to evaluate the impact of miR-21-5p on DF proliferation.Results: Giant panda UC-MSC-Exos are rich in proteins and miRNAs. They significantly boosted DF proliferation and migration, mediated by growth factors like PDGF, TGF-beta 1, b-FGF, and miR-21-5p. We found that miR-21-5p contributes to fibroblast proliferation by targeting the programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and reversion inducing cysteine rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) genes, attenuating the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) induced by TGF-beta 1, and impeding the differentiation of fibroblasts into myoblasts.Conclusions: This study comprehensively reveals the functional properties of giant panda UC-MSC-Exos as well as their therapeutic potential in wound healing, providing insights for improving tissue regeneration and health in giant pandas.

AB In order to alleviate the constraints of global warming and sustainable development, digitalization has made significant contributions to promoting agricultural carbon reduction through resources, technology, and platforms. Under this situation, China insists on developing agricultural scale management. However, what impact will scale management in agricultural digital emission reduction have on mechanisms and pathways? Based on three rounds of follow-up surveys conducted by the Digital Countryside Research Institute of Nanjing Agricultural University in Jiangsu Province from 2022 to 2024, in this study a total of 258 valid questionnaires on the rice and wheat industry were collected. Methods such as member checking and audit trail were employed to ensure data reliability and validity. Using econometric approaches including Tobit, mediation, and moderation models, this study quantified the Scale Management Level (SML), examined the mechanism pathways of digital emission reduction in a scaled environment, further demonstrated the impact of scale management on digital emission reduction, and verified the mediating and moderating effects of internal and external scale management. We found that: (1) In scale and carbon reduction, the SBM-DEA model calculates that the scale of agricultural land in Jiangsu showed an "inverted S" trend with SML and an "inverted W" trend with the overall agricultural green production efficiency (AGPE), and the highest agricultural green production efficiency is 0.814 in the moderate scale range of 20-36.667 hm(2). (2) In digitalization and carbon reduction, the Tobit regression model results indicate that Network Platform Empowerment (NPE) significantly promotes carbon reduction (p < 1%), but its squared terms exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship with agricultural green production efficiency (p < 1%), and SML is significant at the 5% level. From a local regression perspective, the strength of SML's impact on the three core variables is: NPE > DRE > DTE. (3) Adding scale in agricultural digital emission reduction, the intermediary mechanism results showed that the significant intensity (p < 5%) of the mediating role of Agricultural Mechanization Level (AML) is NPE > DTE > DRE, and that of the Employment of Labor (EOL) is DRE > NPE > DTE. (4) Adding scale in agricultural digital emission reduction, the regulatory effect results showed that the Organized Management Level (OML) and Social Service System (SSS) significantly positively regulate the inhibitory effect of DRE and DTE on AGPE. Finally, we suggest controlling the scale of land management reasonably and developing moderate agricultural scale management according to local conditions, enhancing the digital literacy and agricultural machinery training of scale entities while encouraging the improvement of organizational level and social service innovation, and reasonably reducing labor and mechanization inputs in order to standardize the digital emission reduction effect of agriculture under the background of scale.

AB Clustering is a widely used data analysis technique to identify data elements as the same pattern based on the similarity of their features. Nowadays, many advanced algorithms based on densities and graphs have been proposed. However, heterogeneous densities, boundary ambiguities, and noise in the data seriously affect their effectiveness. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a novel boundary and noise detection clustering method using local distribution difference (BNFW). It identifies noise, boundary, and core data based on data distribution differences. Clustering by a small number of core data with clear boundaries, prevents cross-cluster connections, separates weakly connected clusters, and improves clustering efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNFW through experiments on challenging synthetic datasets to detect clusters with different complex structures, detecting clusters from real UCI database datasets, and identifying cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with various data types. Ultimately, BNFW achieved excellent results on both ACC and Purity indicators to prove its superiority.

DE Bletilla striata polysaccharide; ZIF-8; Microneedles; Wound healing;
   Anti-scarring
AB Pathological scars (PS) represent a common complication arising post wound healing, potentially resulting in disfigurement and impaired skin functionality in severe instances. Addressing the clinical challenge wherein conventional single treatment modalities struggle to concurrently expedite wound healing and accurately impede scar formation, this study designed and prepared a pH-responsive Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) microneedle patch (BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs) using a PDMS mold. This MNs with astragaloside IV (As) encapsulated in zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) can intelligently respond to pH variations at different stages of wound healing to enable controlled release of As. When further combined with BSP, they achieve precise synergistic therapy for wound healing and scar inhibition. Furthermore, a thorough and systematic characterization and performance assessment of the MNs were conducted, followed by an evaluation of their efficacy in enhancing wound healing and suppressing scarring using a rat model with full-thickness skin defects and a rabbit ear scar model. The experimental results showed that the BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs exhibited favorable mechanical properties and skin penetration capabilities, alongside remarkable antibacterial efficacy and satisfactory biosafety profiles. Drug release kinetics indicated that the BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs released 76.35% of the payload at pH 5.5 and 25.78% at pH 7.4 after 48 h, highlighting an accelerated release of As with decreasing pH levels. Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that the closure rate of BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs reached 96.85 +/- 0.9% on day 14 (p < 0.001), with nearly complete wound healing by day 21, suggesting a mechanism involving the activation of VEGF and inhibition of TNF-alpha, leading to expedited wound closure. Notably, BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs prevented scar formation (minimal hypertrophic scarring observed on day 35) by reducing TGF-beta 1, reducing the type I/III collagen ratio, and regulating collagen deposition within the TGF-beta 1/Smads pathway. In conclusion, BSP-As@ZIF-8 MNs can synergistically promote wound healing and mitigating scar formation, providing a promising drug delivery strategy for wound repair and scar prevention.

AB BackgroundFeline parvovirus (FPV) causes feline panleukopenia (FPL) and cerebellar ataxia (CA) in cats. to date, only two complete Egyptian VP2 sequences have been available in GenBank. To investigate FPV diversity And evolution in Egypt, we generated 24 complete VP2 sequences from diseased cats during two FPV activity peaks in 2023 (January-February and November-December). Egyptian sequences were Analyzed with 967 global references to assess selection pressure and phylogenetic relationships. In silico predictions of VP2 Antigenic sites, 3D structure, and phosphorylation potential were performed to evaluate the impact of identified mutations.ResultsEgyptian sequences showed 99.3-100% nt And 99.8-100% aa identity among themselves, And 98.6-100% nt And 98.4-100% aa identity with global references. The overall dN/dS ratio was 0.121, with codon 101 under positive selection. Compared to the prototype FPV-b strain (M38246), Egyptian strains had 32 mutations (3 nonsynonymous: Ala5Thr, Ile101Thr, and Thr390Ala; 29 synonymous), forming 19 nt And 3 aa sequence types. Notably, Thr390Ala was unique to Egyptian sequences and absent from all global references. Phylogenetically, Egyptian strains formed two subclades: one composed solely of sequences carrying Thr390Ala (n = 13), And Another including the remaining 11 sequences clustering with 19 global strains sharing the synonymous mutation C135T in addition to A927G and/or A1236G. The Thr390Ala variant predominated in the first peak (11/17, 64.7%) but declined in the second (2/7, 28.6%). Residue 390 lies within an epitope-rich region (aa 350-450) and was predicted to be a phosphorylation site. Thr390Ala caused a modest drop in epitope score, disrupted local hydrogen bonding, and abolished predicted phosphorylation.ConclusionsBeyond expanding the global dataset with the largest number of Egyptian full-length VP2 sequences to date, this study highlights the Thr390Ala mutant as a classic example of evolutionary trade-off: it emerged and predominate during the first peak, potentially as an immune escape variant, but declined in the second peak, likely due to structural constraints and competition with fitter variants. Despite strong purifying selection, this case illustrates that FPV evolution is not entirely static. This underscores the need for continuous genetic monitoring to capture viral evolution in real time and inform effective control strategies.

AB Infant cries serve as critical indicators of an infant's physiological and psychological states, holding essential clinical value in distinguishing between normal and pathological conditions during early development. However, most studies on infant cries failed to segment between inhalation and exhalation during the crying analysis because segmentation remains great challenge. Therefore, we developed an audio data analysis tool capable of accurately segmenting inhalation and exhalation phases in infant cries, followed by extraction of the duration, frequency, and intensity parameters of each segment. Here, 226 sound clips of infants' cries were collected and analyzed. The results revealed the significant differences in sound parameters between premature and term infants. The whole process allows automatic identification and digital collection of infant cries, and it provides an objective method to evaluate the significance behind the cries.

AB Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, plays a vital role in regulating immune responses across various infectious and inflammatory conditions. While IL-10 is essential for preventing excessive tissue damage and maintaining immune homeostasis (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus), its elevated levels could result in immunosuppression during viral infections, enabling viruses to evade host defenses (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease virus). This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which IL-10 mediates immunosuppression in viral infections and to explore the implications of these mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. The key scientific concepts outlined in this review include the mechanisms of IL-10 production and its varied impacts on the immune response during viral infections. Specifically, we discuss the multifaceted inhibitory effects of IL-10 on innate and adaptive immunity, including its implications for antigen presentation, T cells activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, immune cell differentiation, trafficking, apoptosis, and co-inhibitory expression related to T cells exhaustion. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting IL-10, such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors, and their potential to restore effective immune responses. By summarizing current knowledge on IL-10's role in viral infections, this review offers a thorough insight into its immunosuppressive mechanisms and their therapeutic potential, paving the way for innovative treatment strategies in viral diseases.

ID SCALE-FREE; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION
AB Interactive networks play an important role in evolution of cooperation. Compared to traditional game performed on static network, co-evolutionary game models can capture the dynamic interactive connection between players. Aiming to depict more realistic network dynamics, we propose a co-evolutionary game model that incorporates three features describing the entire connection updating process: (1) Selection range adjustment, expanding or reducing players' neighbor selection ranges based on their payoffs; (2) Preferential selection, favoring connection with the most successful players while severing connection with low-payoff player with a certain probabilities; (3) Mutual connection willingness, requiring the consent of both players for new connections. Note that these features jointly facilitate the appearance of large connection range, which frequently emerges in real-world systems. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can drastically enhance cooperation level of snowdrift game with wide ranges of all parameters. More interestingly, the co-evolution process reveals how a scale-free network evolves from the initial lattice structure, providing new insights into realistic co-evolution dynamics. It is also shown that large connection ranges are essential for both high-level cooperation and scale-free network emergence.

AB This review systematically examines the phytochemical composition of Sambucus nigra L. (SN) -particularly terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids-and their structure-function relationships in food matrices. We analyze traditional uses, modern applications in functional foods, and underlying molecular mechanisms through comprehensive literature evaluation. SN's health benefits primarily stem from flavonoid-mediated modulation of NF-kappa B and PPAR gamma pathways, demonstrating dose-dependent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, its anthocyanins demonstrate significant potential in natural food preservation and immunesupport applications. Despite these advantages, challenges persist in standardizing bioactive compounds and substantiating health claims. The study underscores the groundbreaking method of amalgamating traditional knowledge with contemporary scientific evidence to propose strategies for enhancing bioavailability and creating functional foods from elderberry.

AB Douchi is traditionally produced through natural fermentation without intentionally inoculated microorganisms. To improve the fermentation process, this study aimed to investigate the effects on microbiota and flavor during Douchi fermentation using selected autochthonous microorganisms, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens B9 and Pichia kudriavzevii Y18. Results showed that bacteria dominated the fermentation process, while fungi played a supplementary role. Genus-level analysis identified Bacillus as the most prevalent genus during fermentation, while Pichia surged on day 15 and reached peak relative abundance by day 22. During post-fermentation, the total content of volatile compounds increased by 126.91 %, and the content of esters rose significantly to 1190.90 mu g/ kg by day 30. Compared with day 0, six key volatile flavor compounds with odor activity values (OAV) exceeding 1 were newly produced, indicating that the inoculated microorganisms significantly contributed to their formation. Non-volatile metabolites exhibited varying trends, with their accumulations stabilizing in the later stages of fermentation. Notably, amino acids and dipeptides accumulated significantly during fermentation, enhancing the nutritional and flavor profiles of Douchi. The construction of the metabolic network highlighted that amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism were pivotal pathways for flavor enhancement during Douchi postfermentation. Furthermore, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA were critical in Douchi fermentation and acted as core intermediates for flavor compound production, participating in amino acid biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Additionally, Pichia played a role in the biosynthesis of gamma-Aminobutyric acid. This study systematically explored the multidimensional characteristics of Douchi post-fermentation, bridging the gap between descriptive research and mechanism-driven fermentation control strategies.

AB Elucidating the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of closely related sympatric species is essential for understanding niche partitioning dynamics. The forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) and alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) extensively co-occur across the southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, yet their coexistence mechanisms remain unclear. Based on a decade-long dataset (2012-2021) collected from 493 infrared cameras deployed in Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, this study integrated MaxEnt modeling, kernel density estimation, and niche overlap analysis to investigate their spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Spatially, the two species exhibited strong geographic consistency and similar ecological preferences for climate and vegetation factors. Both species shared an elevational range (2870-4572 m ASL) with no clear segregation, likely due to climate-driven forest line shifts. In contrast, temporal partitioning was pronounced: M. berezovskii was mostly nocturnal, while M. chrysogaster was primarily diurnal, with both showing seasonal activity adjustments. These findings highlight temporal niche differentiation as a key coexistence strategy and emphasize the necessity of incorporating geographic variation in habitat adaptation into conservation frameworks.

AB The accurate vehicle positioning is critical for many intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) applications. However, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) often face significant challenges in various demanding scenarios. This article explores the cooperative vehicle localization in GNSS-denied environments by utilizing a fusion of relative distance and angle-of-arrival (AoA) information gathered from vehicles and roadside ultrawideband (UWB) base stations with known coordinates. In dense traffic situations, UWB base stations may experience nonline-of-sight (NLOS) effects when localizing vehicles. To tackle this issue, we propose a strategy that begins by classifying vehicles into line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS categories based on distance and AoA measurements, as well as discrepancies observed between two different localization methods. Initially, we estimate the positions of LOS vehicles, which are then used to determine the positions of NLOS vehicles through the distance information connecting LOS and NLOS vehicles. Once the preliminary positions of all vehicles are established, we employ an iterative optimization algorithm to refine these estimates, ultimately yielding more accurate localization outcomes. Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed method demonstrates the excellent localization performance in both static and dynamic positioning scenarios.

DE Digital governance level; Blockchain technology; Green credit issuance
AB Against the backdrop of the "dual carbon" strategy, green credit has become a key financial instrument for promoting sustainable development. This paper empirically examines the impact of blockchain technology on corporate green credit issuance based on data from A-share listed companies in China from 2019 to 2023. It further introduces the level of local digital governance as a moderating variable, and analyzes the heterogeneous moderating effects under different types of corporate ownership and regional differences. The findings are as follows: (1) Blockchain technology can significantly enhance green credit issuance by enterprises; (2) The level of digital governance positively moderates the relationship between blockchain technology and green credit issuance; (3) The moderating effect of digital governance on the relationship between blockchain technology and green credit issuance is more significant in state-owned enterprises and in western regions. This study enriches the theoretical research on the integration of green finance and financial technology, and provides empirical evidence and policy implications for the coordinated development of green credit and digital governance.

AB Anthocyanins are natural pigments with health benefits but poor stability during processing. Copigmentation with phenolic compounds can improve stability, yet its applicability in modern non-thermal technologies is unclear. High-pressure processing (HPP), a clean-label method widely used in food processing, may enhance anthocyanin protection. This study examined the combined effects of HPP and phenolic copigments on two delphinidin derivatives, delphinidin-3-O-galactoside (DP-3-O-Gal) and delphinidin-3-O-arabinoside (DP-3-O-Ara). Model systems containing chlorogenic acid (CQA), epicatechin (Epi), gallic acid (GA), or vanillin (Van) at a 1:10 M ratio (anthocyanin: copigment) were treated by HPP (500 MPa, 6 min) and stored at 4 degrees C under light (20 days) or dark (105 days). GA provided the strongest protection, reducing DP-3-O-Ara loss to 14 % after 105 days in the dark, compared with 22-24 % for CQA and Epi and 19 % for Van. Under light, CQA and GA delayed DP-3-O-Gal fading by 18 %, whereas Van was ineffective. Molecular simulations indicated GA forms stable it-it stacking and hydrogen-bond complexes. Overall, combining HPP with phenolic compounds, particularly GA, significantly improves anthocyanin stability and offers a promising strategy for clean-label functional foods.

ID DEVELOPMENT GOALS; CHINA
AB This study employs a systems theory approach to investigate the coupling coordination and driving mechanisms within the economic-social-environmental (ESE) system in China's ethnic regions. It analyzes 67 ethnic counties in Sichuan Province, using an integrated framework that combines dynamic Shannon entropy, coupling coordination modeling, and GeoDetector. Based on data from 2005 to 2024, the study reveals the spatiotemporal patterns of ESE coupling coordination. The key findings are as follows: (1) The coupling coordination degree has gone through four stages: moderate imbalance -> mild imbalance -> primary coordination -> moderate coordination. By 2024, 81.8% of counties had achieved coordinated development, and "highly coordinated" counties emerged for the first time. (2) The Western Sichuan Plateau has formed a high-high agglomeration zone by monetizing ecological assets and utilizing ethnic cultural resources. In contrast, the hilly and parallel ridge-valley regions in central and eastern Sichuan remain in low-low agglomerations due to their dependency on traditional industrialization paths. The decrease in high-low and low-high outliers indicates the recent policy polarization effects. (3) The interaction between habitat quality and per capita GDP has the strongest explanatory power. The rising marginal contributions of energy and carbon emission intensity suggest that green industrialization is crucial to breaking the "poverty-pollution" trap.

AB Background Obesity is a global health issue, with sharply increasing rates due to excessive food intake and reduced physical activity, leading to an increased risk of various chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Fat distribution plays a significant role in health, with visceral fat being particularly associated with metabolic syndrome. Currently, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the gold standards for measuring visceral fat, but they are costly and involve radiation risks. The gut microbiota is closely related to obesity, and dysbiosis may lead to obesity and metabolic disorders. Research on the relationship between visceral fat and the gut microbiota can aid in the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.Methods We selected 31 participants with class II obesity (body mass index between 35 and 40) and divided those samples into two groups on the basis of their VSR (visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio) measured by CT, analyzed their fecal. Microbiota through 16S rDNA sequencing.Results Results reveal significant differences in microbial composition between the visceral and subcutaneous obesity groups through 16S analysis of their fecal microbiota. The visceral obesity group presented a greater abundance of the Blautia genus, whereas the subcutaneous obesity group presented a greater abundance of the Faecalibacterium genus. Species difference analysis and clinical correlation analysis revealed that Blautia and Faecalibacterium were associated with visceral and subcutaneous obesity, respectively, and played opposite roles. Moreover, in our validation cohort (n = 16), we also found that the subcutaneous obesity group had a greater abundance of the Faecalibacterium genus.Conclusion This study measured visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes via CT and revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota is related to the type of obesity. In addition, we found that Blautia and Faecalibacterium were associated with visceral and subcutaneous obesity, which provides new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of obesity.

AB Background As an asymmetrical sport, tennis positively influences the increase of bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescents. However, most current studies focus on specific body regions, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the impact of tennis on BMD in various parts of the body. Therefore, this study aims to systematically assess the impact of tennis on BMD in different areas of the body. Objective This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of tennis on BMD in males. Methods Comprehensive search was conducted across databases including Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, and Embase to identify high-quality randomized controlled trials examining the effects of tennis on BMD. The search covered literature from database inception to March 2025. Data were screened, extracted, coded, and statistically analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. Study selection was based on the PICOS criteria: (i) male tennis players compared to non-tennis players of the same age; (ii) tennis intervention group versus groups engaging in other regular physical activities; (iii) outcome indicators included bone mineral content (BMC) and BMD; and (iv) study design included cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, or controlled experiments. Result A total of 10 articles involving 761 male participants aged between 10 and 26 were included in the analysis. Tennis intervention was found to significantly improve bone measures in several areas. Specifically, it led to increases in dominant arm BMC (SMD = 0.57 mg/mm, 95% CI [0.01, 1.13], P = 0.04), lumbar spine BMD (MD = 0.10 g/cm(2), 95% CI [0.08, 0.11], P < 0.00001), dominant arm and radius BMD (SMD = 1.34 g/cm(2), 95% CI [0.49, 2.80], P = 0.002), and right femur BMD (MD = 0.10 g/cm(2), 95% CI [0.02, 0.18], P = 0.02). These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conversely, tennis had no significant effect on whole-body BMC (MD = 25.51 mg/mm, 95% CI [-38.43, 85.35], P = 0.43), non-dominant arm BMC (SMD = 0.03 mg/mm, 95% CI [-0.31, 0.37], P = 0.88), total body BMD (MD = 0.00 g/cm(2), 95% CI [-0.01, 0.01], P = 0.97), femoral neck BMD (MD = 0.01 g/cm(2), 95% CI [-0.00, 0.01], P = 0.30), or left femur BMD (MD = -0.01 g/cm(2), 95% CI [-0.07, 0.05], P = 0.84). These findings were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Additionally, subgroup analyses further revealed that tennis training exerted a targeted impact on BMD. Training durations of more than 7 years and at least 15 hours per week significantly improved BMD in the dominant arm and radius. Additionally, significant improvements in the non-dominant arm and radius BMD were observed in participants with over 2 years of training experience. Enhancement of greater trochanter BMD was closely associated with age of training initiation, with significant improvements noted when training began after age 15. In contrast, tennis had minimal influence on femoral neck BMD. Conclusion Tennis effectively enhances BMD in the dominant arm, radius, lumbar spine, greater trochanter, and right lower limb. The effects are asymmetrical, favoring the dominant side. Therefore, to maintain balanced development of BMC and BMD in both limbs, it is recommended to include contralateral (non-dominant side) training during tennis practice.Systematic review registration https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/identifier: CRD42023486547.

AB The endangered Tibetan herb Phlomoides rotata is threatened by overharvesting and slow natural regeneration. To support its sustainable utilisation, we investigated the mechanisms underlying its phenotypic plasticity during low-altitude adaptation using an integrated multi-omics approach. Specifically, rhizosphere soils and leaf tissues were collected from P. rotata cultivated at high-, mid-, and low altitudes for multi-omics analysis, including bacterial and fungal profiling, and phenotypic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic assessments. Altitude-dependent shifts were observed in microbial community composition. Functional profiling suggests that rhizosphere microbial communities of P. rotata at low altitude possess enhanced metabolic activity and nutrient cycling capacity. Procrustes analysis revealed strong concordance between potential microbial indicators and phenotypic traits (R-2 = 0.84, p = 0.002 for bacteria, R-2 = 0.82, p = 0.005 for fungi). Transcriptomic analysis identified 3336 and 9208 unigenes associated with phenotypic variation. GO enrichment revealed that low-altitude samples were dominated by growth-related functions, while high-altitude samples favoured defence responses. KEGG enrichment of hub genes supported this pattern, highlighting enhanced developmental and biosynthetic pathways at low altitudes and stress-regulatory processes at high altitudes. Metabolomic analysis identified 658 altitude-associated differential metabolites. KEGG enrichment showed zeatin biosynthesis was prominent at high altitudes, while butanoate, starch, and sucrose metabolism were enriched at low altitudes. Furthermore, random forest analysis of phenotype-associated metabolites revealed that phenylpropanoids and organic acids were characteristic of high-altitude samples, while organoheterocyclic compounds were more typical of low-altitude environments. Mantel test and PLS-SEM modelling jointly revealed that altitude-driven shifts in rhizosphere microbiome function regulate host gene expression and secondary metabolism, ultimately shaping phenotypic variation. This comprehensive research provides novel insights into the environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity of alpine medicinal plants during low-altitude adaptation and offers a deeper understanding of the key drivers of this process.

TI Research on deep learning model for stock prediction by integrating
   frequency domain and time series features
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the field of financial technology, stock prediction has become a popular research direction due to its high volatility and uncertainty. Most existing models can only process single temporal features, failing to capture multi-scale temporal patterns and latent cyclical components embedded in price fluctuations, while also neglecting the interactions between different stocks-resulting in predictions that lack accuracy and stability. The StockMixer with ATFNet model proposed in this paper integrates both time-domain and frequency-domain features. By fusing information from both domains, the deep neural network significantly improves prediction accuracy and reliability. While temporal feature analysis is common, frequency-domain features, derived via spectral analysis (e.g., Fourier Transform), can reveal latent periodicities and seasonality patterns in price movements. This study employs an adaptive fusion approach to allow the two types of features to complement and enhance each other. The main innovations of this model are reflected in three aspects: (1) Construction of a time-channel hybrid model (MultTime2dMixer) to decouple the temporal evolution and inter-channel interactions of multivariate time series. (2) A novel non-graph-based stock relation modeling approach (NoGraphMixer) is proposed, which employs a learnable attention-based mapping mechanism to dynamically capture cross-stock dependencies without relying on pre-defined or static graph structures-thereby overcoming the inflexibility of conventional graph-based relation encoders. (3) Integration of a frequency-domain complex attention model (ATFNet) to model discontinuities in both the time and frequency domains, providing a strong supplement to time-domain modeling. At the implementation level, the original stock sequences are subjected to bidirectional feature extraction along both time and channel dimensions. NoGraphMixer is then used to construct implicit stock correlations. ATFNet is applied to map time-series data into both the temporal and frequency domains, extracting spectral features. Finally, a fusion mechanism integrates multimodal information to achieve effective fusion of multi-source data. Experimental results show significant improvements in classification evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) for predicting price movement direction, as well as in metrics assessing the ranking ability of return predictions and backtesting performance-IC, RIC, Prec@N, and Sharpe Ratio (SR).

AB With the proliferation of LEO satellite constellations and increasing demands for on-orbit intelligence, satellite networks generate massive, heterogeneous, and privacy-sensitive data. Ensuring efficient model collaboration under strict privacy constraints remains a critical challenge. This paper proposes HiSatFL, a cross-domain adaptive and privacy-preserving federated learning framework tailored to the highly dynamic and resource-constrained nature of satellite communication systems. The framework incorporates an orbital-aware hierarchical FL architecture, a multi-level domain adaptation mechanism, and an orbit-enhanced meta-learning strategy to enable rapid adaptation with limited samples. In parallel, privacy is preserved via noise-calibrated feature alignment, differentially private adversarial training, and selective knowledge distillation, guided by a domain-aware dynamic privacy budget allocation scheme. We further establish a unified optimization framework balancing privacy, utility, and adaptability, and derive convergence bounds under dynamic topologies. Experimental results on diverse remote sensing datasets demonstrate that HiSatFL significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, adaptability, and communication efficiency, highlighting its practical potential for collaborative on-orbit AI.

AB Tributyl phosphate (TBP), an organophosphorus compound, presents substantial risks to both living organisms and the macro environment, particularly its degradation processes. Although current studies have explored TBP degradation in deionized water using isotopic fractionation and mass spectrometry (MS), the crucial effects of natural aquatic environments remain unexplored. Therefore, this study comprehensively investigates how common inorganic anions and various environmentally relevant water matrices affect the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of TBP in UV-activated oxidation systems. Results show that <middle dot>OH and SO4-<middle dot> reached steady-state concentrations of 2.6 x 10(-13) M and 7.1 x 10(-12) M, contributing 75 % and 57 % to TBP degradation in UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS) system, respectively. These were accompanied by carbon enrichment factors (epsilon(C)) of -0.5 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and -0.8 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand. The apparent kinetic isotope effect (AKIE) was determined to be 1.013, and MS analysis confirmed that C-H bond cleavage occurred in both <middle dot>OH and SO4-<middle dot>-driven oxidation processes. The epsilon(C) values remained identical, showing no significant difference (p > 0.05) and overlapping 95 % confidence intervals (C.I.) in both UV/H2O2 and UV/PDS systems. When simulating natural water conditions using three anions (Cl-, HCO3- and HPO42-), slight changes in degradation rates of TBP were observed, but epsilon(C) values remain unaffected. Similar results were found using groundwater. Nevertheless, no significant carbon isotopic fractionation was detected in seawater (Delta delta C-13<1 parts per thousand), suggesting that certain extrinsic environmental parameters (such as dissolved organic matter) may facilitate an alternative reaction mechanism that proceeds without carbon bond cleavage. Overall, this study underscores the utility of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) as a robust method for assessing TBP degradation in deionized water and groundwater; however, its application in seawater requires further investigation due to the distinct bond cleavage mechanisms involved.

AB QuestionsAccurately measuring species distribution patterns has long been a fundamental task in community and spatial ecology. This study tries to address the following ecological problems: (1) Are distance-based methods powerful and sensitive enough to detect subtle changes of spatial distributional patterns of species in a distributional map, particularly when it comes to complete random distribution? (2) How can spatial distributional aggregation patterns be effectively and rapidly compared when the size of spatial distributional data is large?LocationGlobal.MethodsWe propose a one-dimensional aggregation index, quadrat nearest neighboring distance (QNN), integrated with an optimal spatial subdivision protocol. This method was evaluated via numerical simulations and applied to empirical species distribution data and compared against Clark and Evans' R index, which is built upon two-dimensional nearest neighboring distance (NND).ResultsQNN is accurate in detecting complete random distribution over different population sizes of species. The accuracy of QNN depended on using an optimal gridding size. The accuracy of detecting the complete random distribution of species is guaranteed when the sampling grain size in QNN is around the optimal gridding size. Furthermore, QNN showed high computational efficiency in extensive numerical simulations.ConclusionsQNN offers a powerful, efficient, and scalable tool for detecting and comparing species spatial distribution patterns. Its enhanced sensitivity to random distributions and dependence on optimal gridding make it especially suitable for analyzing large-scale or high-resolution spatial data.

AB Mycobacteria pose significant global health burdens, with Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex causing tuberculosis-a leading infectious killer claiming over 1.25 million lives annually-and NTM driving pulmonary and ulcerative infections, particularly in immunocompromised populations. Autophagy, a conserved cellular degradation pathway, serves as a critical mechanism of host defense against mycobacteria by delivering bacteria to the lysosome. As a response, mycobacteria have evolved intricate strategies to subvert or exploit autophagy for survival. Consequently, autophagy exhibits a dichotomous role in mycobacterial infection: functioning as a protective mechanism of host while simultaneously serving as a virulence determinant hijacked by bacteria for their survival. This review synthesizes current insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating host-initiated autophagy during mycobacterial infection, as well as the bacterial strategies for subverting or hijacking autophagic pathways. While autophagy may be hijacked by mycobacteria, substantial evidence from numerous studies demonstrates that autophagy-activating agents may be beneficial in restricting mycobacteria infection, even with multidrug-resistant strains. This review also systematizes promising agents that enhance autophagy to improve bacterial clearance. By synthesizing the latest research findings, this article aims to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between autophagy and mycobacteria, paving the way for efficient host-directed therapies (HDTs) against this severely harmful pathogen.

AB Postdisaster housing reconstruction is a long-term process that includes planning, rebuilding, relocation, and evaluation. True insights into the living conditions of disaster survivors emerge only in the later stages of reconstruction. However, short-term rebuilding and resettlement often attract more attention, while the long-term outcomes are frequently overlooked. This paper, based on the researchers' extensive involvement in the post-Wenchuan Earthquake reconstruction in Dujiangyan City, uses data from the local government's reconstruction management committee for policy review, spatial analysis, and resettlement benefit evaluation. Field research, surveys, and household interviews were conducted in five rural communities to assess the policies, implementation, and outcomes of the reconstruction. The results showed that: (1) during the reconstruction period following the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, the reconstruction efforts in rural areas exhibited relatively good completion rates and short-term resettlement benefits but limited survivor participation and challenges in livelihood recovery in the later stages; (2) despite low perceived benefits in participation and livelihood recovery, survivors showed high overall satisfaction, likely due to insufficient postearthquake funds and energy among the survivors, strong government intervention, and support for reconstruction policies; (3) livelihood sustainability of relocated residents needs more attention, as many lost access to farming and faced increased living costs; and (4) even when the same reconstruction model is applied, there can be significant differences in the implementation of reconstruction across different communities. unified planning self-reconstruction model tends to increase survivors' financial and energy costs but also allows for greater participation and freedom, making it easier for residents to adapt to postreconstruction life. In contrast, government-led unified planning model often requires lower direct financial costs from the survivors, but offers limited participation and freedom, with the reconstruction process more heavily influenced by government decisions. As a result, the effectiveness of reconstruction may vary significantly between communities, posing challenges for effective government planning and decision-making.

AB Understanding N-P interactions is crucial for co-limitation in ecosystems but remains unclear due to oversimplified frameworks. Here, a large-scale N and P addition experiment in early soils revealed four key processes driving nutrient coupling, emphasizing carbon's central role. N addition significantly increases P availability. P availability drives biological N fixation. Both nutrients stimulate carbon fixation, with N having a stronger effect. N addition also intensifies ammonia nitrification, further reducing pH; P has no significant effect on nitrification. Based on these findings and prior research, we establish two models: one depicting P-driven N availability, the other N-driven P availability. These models highlight carbon-related processes as central to N-P coupling, enhancing nutrient availability in early soils. The results reveal a synergistic pathway where nutrient enrichment boosts co-availability rather than intensifying limitation. This framework clarifies the driving mechanisms of N-P bioavailability interactions that support positive ecosystem succession during soil development.

AB This study takes the traditional residential houses in Yihai Village, Liangshan Prefecture, as the research object, and through field measurements, semi-structured interviews, and DesignBuilder numerical simulation, it is found that the indoor temperatures of its traditional residential houses in winter are generally lower than 10 degrees C, with faster heat dissipation and poorer thermal comfort. Based on this, suitable indoor thermal environment optimization techniques are proposed for residential houses. The research results show that: (1) By using 50 mm polystyrene foam board (EPS), the heat transfer coefficient of the exterior wall was reduced to about 0.48 W/(m2-K), and the indoor temperature was raised to about 9.5 degrees C; (2) EPS panels are used in large areas of the roof to reduce costs, and extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) is used in key areas to improve local insulation performance, increasing the average daily indoor temperature by about 3 degrees C; (3) By adding skylights to the roof, the average indoor lighting coefficient of the main house has improved from essentially no light before the renovation to about 3.5 %, and that of the compartments has improved from less than 1 % to about 2.8 %; (4)The additional sunroom design increases the average daily temperatures in the living room of a traditional house by about 1.5 degrees C and in the bedroom by about 1.7 degrees C, and reduces daily temperature differences and the temperature fluctuation at night. This study can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development and preservation of traditional houses in Liangshan Prefecture and serve as a reference for the transformation of conventiona houses in similar areas.

AB The global obesity epidemic and associated metabolic disorders present urgent public health challenges. This study employed a multi-omics approach (lipidomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome analysis) to investigate how Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSPs) and composite polysaccharides modulate liver lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. HFD elevated hepatic phosphatidylcholines, cholesteryl esters (CEs), and acylcarnitines (CARs), alongside increased cecal choline and trimethylamine. BSP interventions reduced hepatic CEs, free fatty acids (FAs), CARs, and cecal sarcosine while restoring gut microbial diversity. Notably, BSP enriched beneficial genera, including Jeotgalicoccus and Atopostipes, and the network analysis revealed negative correlations between these genera and hepatic triglycerides (TGs), implicating the gut-liver axis in lipid metabolism regulation. These findings elucidate the anti-obesity mechanisms of polysaccharides through gut microbiota remodeling and cross-tissue metabolic interactions, providing a foundation for leveraging plant polysaccharides in developing safer, effective obesity therapies.

AB Piezoelectric ultrasonic motors play a pivotal role in advancing intelligent and high-tech applications, drawing significant attention to the study of defects in piezoelectric materials. Defect modulation, achieved through the incorporation of appropriate additives, stands out as a proven and effective strategy for enhancing the performance of ceramics. Herein, defect structure and the orientation behavior under external fields has been emphasized on in potassium sodium niobate ceramics with excess bismuth. Elevated defect polarization is revealed with increased A-site vacancy and decreased oxygen vacancy when bismuth is strongly excessive, along with lowered orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition temperature. The defect polarization is oriented under a high electric field and depolarized under a strong thermal field. This is evidenced by asymmetric ferroelectric hysteresis loops and a large internal bias field in poled ceramics, while unpoled and depolarized samples display nearly symmetrical loops. Additionally, asymmetric bipolar strain curves with a notable deviation between positive and negative electric fields are observed in poled samples, whereas annealing reduces this asymmetry. Meanwhile, the domain switching becomes more difficult in the poled state compared to the virgin state due to the pinning effect induced by oriented defect polarization during pre-poling. Then, large Qm and d33 as well as decreasing and increasing tendencies respectively, are gained simultaneously with increased defect, generated by the strong promoted domain switching from elevated A-site vacancy and lowered phase transition temperature, with respect to the impeded effect from pinning effect of defect dipoles. Therefore, this study demonstrated the defect evolution under external fields and the impact on macro-performance, accelerating the material development for piezoelectric motors.

AB Currently, first removal of iron and then extraction of titanium from the ilmenite leachate using solvent extraction was a popular research topic for recovery of strategic materials titanium and iron. However, the reported studies showed poor extraction efficiency and selectivity for titanium and iron in the later stage due to the randomness of initial screening of extractants, which had resulted in a lengthy process for removing impurity metal ions and increased costs. This paper designed the functional extractants for high selectivity recovery of titanium and iron from ilmenite HCl leachate based on the extraction mechanism, respectively. The extraction mechanisms were first demonstrated in detail. Then, the designed extractant, amides and long-chain alkyl alcohols, showed desired advantages and high performance for extraction of iron (99.95%) and titanium (99.23%) through actual extraction of metal ions from ilmenite HCl leachate, respectively. Meanwhile, the separation coefficients of iron and titanium to other metal ions were much greater than 1. Subsequently, the distribution and transfer laws of impurity metal ions, V, Cr, Mn, Mg, Ca and Al, in aqueous and organic phases were specifically revealed during all processes, and majority of impurity metal ions coextracted were removed. Finally, 99.82 wt% of iron solution and 99.87 wt% of titanium solution were obtained, respectively. This study may contribute to the design of functional extractants and its application in efficient recovery of valuable metals.

AB This paper investigates the synchronization of master-slave neural networks under asynchronous cyber attacks. First, a novel asynchronous cyber attack strategy is proposed, governed by two independent Markov jump processes. Next, a dual-Markov dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced, which saves communication resources and enhances defense against attacks. Additionally, a novel asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is proposed, combining the reciprocal convex combinatorial inequality and the zero-equation method to reduce the conservatism of the stability criteria. An adaptive Markov jump event-triggered controller is then designed to achieve synchronization of the master-slave neural networks. Finally, two synchronization criteria are derived, and two sets of values are provided to validate these criteria.

TI MitoQ alleviates prion-induced neurodegeneration by modulating DRP1-and

AB Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders with no effective treatments. MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, has shown promise in treating mitochondrial redox-related diseases; however, its role in prion diseases remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that MitoQ significantly alleviates PrP106-126-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. Specifically, MitoQ reduces intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, enhances total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and the glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, restores oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and intracellular ATP levels, and prevents cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. Mechanistically, MitoQ downregulates dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) phosphorylation at Ser616 and reduces mitochondrial DRP1 accumulation, while upregulating optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), thereby improving the mitochondrial dynamics imbalance induced by PrP106-126. Notably, DRP1 overexpression or OPA1 knockdown abolishes these protective effects, resulting in persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. These findings suggest that MitoQ alleviates prioninduced neurodegeneration by modulating DRP1- and OPA1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics, highlighting its therapeutic potential in prion diseases.

AB Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making early diagnosis critical for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient prognosis. Computer-aided diagnosis systems, which analyze computed tomography images, have proven effective in detecting and classifying pulmonary nodules, significantly enhancing the detection rate of early-stage lung cancer. Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks. The integration of ensemble models and novel techniques is also discussed, emphasizing the latest developments in lung cancer diagnosis. Deep learning algorithms, combined with various analytical techniques, have markedly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule analysis, surpassing traditional methods, particularly in nodule classification. Although challenges remain, continuous technological advancements are expected to further strengthen the role of deep learning in medical diagnostics, especially for early lung cancer detection and diagnosis.

AB This study investigated the effects of 36 h of acute sleep deprivation on the functional connectivity of olfactory-related brain regions in healthy young males and examined the relationship between these effects, individual alertness, and emotional state. Sixty participants underwent assessments both before and after sleep deprivation, including a psychomotor vigilance task, a sleepiness scale, a mood scale, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results demonstrated that sleep deprivation significantly increased reaction times while reducing reaction speed. Participants exhibited increased sleepiness, particularly during rest, along with significant declines in tension and self-esteem. Notably, functional connectivity within olfactory-related brain regions was significantly disrupted, with alterations extending across multiple areas involved in cognition, emotion, and motor coordination. Specifically, the amygdala showed decreased functional connectivity with the inferior and superior cerebellum, pericalcarine cortex, and lingual gyrus, while the hippocampus exhibited decreased functional connectivity with the lingual gyrus, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior cerebellum. Further correlation analyses revealed a complex interplay between the functional connectivity of these regions and participants' levels of vigilance, sleepiness, and mood. These findings provide new insights into the broader neurophysiological consequences of sleep deprivation on olfactory-related brain function.

AB As the second most malignant neoplasm in the world, colorectal cancer (CRC) still needs the novel treatment strategy urgently. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in CRC research, but the development of CDK2 inhibitors still faces significant challenges. This study was to investigate the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of licoisoflavone A (LA) in targeting CDK2. HCT116 and SW480 human CRC cells were used to evaluate the in vitro anti-CRC activity and CDK2 regulation effect of LA by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Molecular docking and CDK2 knockdown cell models were used to investigate the direction interaction between LA and CDK2. Patient-derived CRC organoids and tumor-bearing mice were used to verify the anti-CRC activity and mechanism of LA. As a result, LA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced G1/S phase arrest in HCT116 and SW480 cells. LA had direct interaction with CDK2, and not only inhibited the formation of the CDK2/cyclin E1 complex, but also suppressed its kinase activity through the upregulation of p27, thereby inhibiting Rb phosphorylation and arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Moreover, LA exerted anti-CRC effect in CRC organoids and the subcutaneous xenograft tumor mode without evident toxic effects. LA inhibits CRC cell proliferation through targeting the CDK2-Cyclin E1 axis-mediated cell cycle transition. Our research provides compelling evidence that LA may serve as a potential agent for the treatment of CRC, and also provides a rationale to design novel CDK2 inhibitors.

TI NaGB-DBSCAN: An improved DBSCAN clustering algorithm by natural neighbor

SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Clustering; DBSCAN; Natural neighbor; Granular-ball
AB DBSCAN is a robust density-based clustering algorithm, which performs well in handling noisy and irregular datasets. However, it relies on the setting of two parameters (epsilon and m), and parameter adjustment is rather troublesome. Moreover, it needs to scan all data points one by one, resulting in a time complexity of O(N2). To solve these problems, we propose an improved DBSCAN algorithm, which combines Natural Neighbor and Granular-Ball, named NaGB-DBSCAN. Our method has the following several advantages: (1) It requires only a single parameter, which makes it significantly easier to set up. (2) It reduces the data processing workload by combining natural neighbor with granular-ball to cover the original dataset, which lowers the time complexity to O(N log N). (3) It effectively handles datasets with heterogeneous density and weak connections, enhancing clustering efficiency and quality by optimizing the process and accurately identifying distinct cluster structures. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method on 17 synthetic datasets, 14 real datasets, and 1 immune cell dataset. The results show that NaGB-DBSCAN ranks first in average Purity and NMI scores, with both exceeding 90% on the immune cell dataset. Furthermore, pairwise t-tests hypothesis experiment confirm the statistical significance of these results.

AB Water pollution from heavy metal ions and organic dyes is a serious global environmental problem. Eco-friendly, multifunctional, and highly adsorptive bio-based hydrogels are attracting increasing interests in pollutant remediation. However, traditional adsorbents often deal with a single pollution system or struggle with reduced adsorption effects in multipollutant systems. Herein, a multipollutant hydrogel adsorbent (HAP) is synthesised by a collaborative crosslinking method with water-soluble 2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HACC) as a bio-adsorbent substrate, acrylic acid (AAc) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) as reticular polymer frameworks. The presence of homogeneous porous structure along with abundant electronegative functional groups offers ample interstitial space and fully accessible adsorption sites for HAP. It exhibits rapid and superior maximum adsorption capacity for single pollutants including malachite green (MG, 3754 mg g- 1), crystal violet (CV, 2726 mg g- 1), rhodamine B (RhB, 1815 mg g- 1), and Pb2+ (564 mg g- 1). Moreover, the HAP achieves highefficient synergistic enhancement of adsorption for Pb2+ (141 %), MO (111 %), RhB (47 %), CV (35 %), and MG (20 %) in a multipollutant system. The results demonstrate that HAP can maintain stable and excellent removal ability in multiple adsorption-desorption cycles and even in diverse real wastewater, highlighting its potential as an efficient and cost-effective multipollutant adsorbent for practical wastewater treatment applications.

AB BackgroundGlobal climate change has led to dynamic changes in snow and ice cover, exerting a profound impact on the functional traits and reproductive adaptation strategies of perennial plants in alpine meadows. However, the underlying response mechanisms remain unclear. Through the field simulation experiments with different snowpack thicknesses in the alpine meadows of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, we systematically analyzed the response patterns and regulatory mechanisms of the organ functional traits and reproductive allocation of four perennial plants: Saussurea nigrescens, Anaphalis lactea, Elymus nutans, and Koeleria macrantha.ResultsChanges in snowpack significantly affected resource allocation strategies of plants. In snow removal condition, S. nigrescens and A. lactea significantly reduced the biomass of vegetative organs, while K. macrantha significantly decreased its reproductive allocation under multi-fold snowpack. E. nutans maintained stable reproductive allocation under different snowpack treatments, demonstrating its high adaptability. Compared with the stability of carbon (TC) content, the nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) contents in various plant organs were more sensitive to changes in snowpack, and there were significant differences in nutrient responses among different organs and species. We found that Apart from E. nutans, the reproductive allocation of the other three plant species showed significant responses to soil temperature and/or moisture. The impact of changes in snowpack on reproductive traits was partially dependent on individual size, suggesting that plants had diverse adaptation strategies in resource allocation.ConclusionSignificant changes in snowpack profoundly influence plant resource allocation patterns among different functional organs, highlighting the diverse adaptation strategies plants employ under resource scarcity and environmental stress. Soil temperature and moisture are key factors influencing reproductive allocation in four plant species. The relationship between reproductive allocation and individual size varies across species. This study provides a scientific basis for understanding ecosystem functions and plant population maintenance mechanisms in alpine meadow ecosystems under climate change.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a severe viral disease in pigs caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). It poses a severe threat to the global swine breeding industry. Recently, the emergence of PRRSV lineage 1C.5 in the United States and China with the RFLP 1-4-4 pattern has raised worldwide attention; however, there are few studies on the genome and pathogenic characteristics of the L1C.5 RFLP 1-4-4 PRRSV in China. In this study, a novel PRRSV-2 variant, designated GX2024, was isolated from a RespPRRS MLV-vaccinated piglet in China using Marc-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). The complete viral genome was further determined and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of its ORF5 gene showed that GX2024 belonged to PRRSV-2 L1C.5 (RFLP-1-4-4) group, whereas the complete genome sequence clustered into L8E (JXA1-like) group and it contains a discontinuous 131-aa deletion in NSP2 when compared to the NADC30 strain. Notably, recombination analyses indicated that GX2024 is a multiple recombinant virus from two wild-type PRRSVs L1C.5 (NADC30-like) and L8E (JXA1-like), and a RespPRRS MLV vaccine (L5A) strain. To tested the pathogenicity of GX2024, nine four-week-old piglets were divided into two groups (GX2024-challenge group, n = 5; negative control, n = 4). GX2024 infection caused high fever (40-42 degrees C) and severe hemorrhagic pneumonia with pulmonary edema. The lymph nodes exhibited obvious hemorrhagic spots with lymphadenopathy. Of note, all GX2024-infected piglets died within 14 days with 100% mortality, indicating that GX2024 is a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain. Our study reports the emergence of a novel highly pathogenic L1C.5 RFLP-1-4-4 recombinant strain, which merits special attention in control and vaccine strategies in China.

AB This study identified Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SS0831 (LP) as a high-performing strain in suansun and investigated its impact on flavor quality through comprehensive analyses of flavor compounds, microbial succession, functional dynamics, and metabolic pathways. Compared with naturally fermented suansun (NFS), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum-inoculated fermented suansun (LPIFS) exhibited higher acidity and improved sensory scores. LPIFS contained 63 aroma compounds, significantly more than the 41 detected in NFS. Notably, pcresol levels in LPIFS decreased by over 50 % within the first seven days of fermentation, while alcohols, esters, and aldehydes increased, enriching the overall flavor profile. It additionally uncovered a notable positive correlation involving Lactococcus in conjunction with p-cresol, 2-nonenal, and phenylethanol. During early fermentation, Proteobacteria played a crucial role in flavor formation. The microbial community in LPIFS demonstrated enhanced carbohydrate metabolism. Particularly noteworthy is that LPIFS enhances flavor through a dual strategy-reducing the formation of acidic off-flavors while increasing aromatic compounds. The positive correlation between Lactococcus and p-cresol sheds light on the underlying mechanism of aroma enhancement. By facilitating more moderate cooperative interactions among the microbial communities in LPIFS, galactose, butanoate, and tyrosine metabolisms may be altered, while tryptophan metabolism may be modified, leading to reduced p-cresol production. Moreover, enhanced pyruvate metabolism was also a key factor in the synthesis of increased aroma compounds. These findings provide new insights into suansun flavor enhancement and the metabolic mechanisms driving its improvement.

DE Mild heat-induced; Composite particle; Fucoidan; Yak meat storage
AB This study enhanced the stability of black rice anthocyanins (ANS) by gently inducing the formation of electrostatic encapsulation particles through the synergistic interaction of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IGY) and fucoidan. Results showed that after heat induction at 40 degrees C, the increasing alpha-helices content in the protein facilitated its binding with anthocyanins, and effectively improved thermal stability by 20.16 %. Additionally, fucoidan effectively reduced anthocyanin degradation caused by illumination (15.01 %) and vitamin C (46.87 %) by forming of a dense surrounding layer on the complex's surface through electrostatic interactions with IGY, which promoted the aggregation of protein and anthocyanin, while maintaining a high anthocyanin retention rate and total reducing capacity during in vitro digestion. Moreover, the results of yak meat storage demonstrated that the stable complex structure of fucoidan/egg yolk immunoglobulin complex facilitated the slow release of anthocyanins, thereby effectively delaying lipid oxidation during the preservation of yak meat. This study provides a theoretical basis for enhancing the stability of anthocyanins.

AB The normal development of ovarian follicles, characterized by oocyte growth and granulosa cell proliferation, is essential for maintaining female fertility. Elevated oxidative stress, resulting from various in vivo and in vitro factors, significantly impairs follicular development, ovulation, and overall female fertility. Swertiamarin, a naturally occurring iridoid terpenoid compound, exhibits multiple beneficial properties, including anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant effects. This study investigates the impact of Swertiamarin on follicular development impairment induced by oxidative stress, using the commonly applied oxidant 3-nitrophthalic acid (3-NPA) in a murine model. Our findings indicate that Swertiamarin administration mitigates the adverse effects of 3-NPA on follicular development and ovulation. Further analyses reveal that Swertiamarin treatment partially enhances granulosa cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis under oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Swertiamarin reduces oxidative stress in ovaries and granulosa cells exposed to 3-NPA. The expression levels of key members of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (Ho-1), and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1), were upregulated following Swertiamarin supplementation in 3-NPA-treated ovaries and granulosa cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Swertiamarin can partially restore defective follicular development induced by oxidative stress via modulating the NRF2/HO-1 pathway in granulosa cells. These findings provide novel insights into the potential application of Swertiamarin in enhancing female reproductive health and offer a promising strategy for addressing reproductive damage caused by oxidative stress.

AB Microtubules, composed of alpha(3-tubulin heterodimers, serve as key targets for anticancer therapeutics due to their critical role in cell division. Numerous compounds have been discovered to interact with tubulin and disrupt microtubule dynamics, particularly those targeting the colchicine-binding domain. Certain flavones, for instance, have demonstrated the ability to bind to this site and suppress microtubule polymerization. Despite their potential, progress in developing flavone-based drugs has been limited by insufficient structural data on tubulinligand complexes. Here, we present the high-resolution (1.92 & Aring;) crystal structure of tubulin in complex with a flavone derivative, quercetin 3,4 '-dimethyl ether (QU34), elucidating the specific molecular interactions at atomic detail. By analyzing this structure alongside other colchicine-site inhibitors, we clarify prior structure-activity relationship (SAR) findings and offer a framework for designing optimized flavone analogs targeting this site.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (YCHT) was initially recorded in the Chinese medicine classic Shang Han Lun, which was written by Zhang Zhongjing, and it has long been used orally as a classic formula. Jia-Wei-Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang (JWYCHT) comprises YCHT added with the widely used Chinese Yi medicine Liangtoumao (Incarvillea arguta (Royle) Royle). JWYCHT has become a promising therapeutic option for several liver and gallbladder disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), among the Chinese Yi population. However, its specific mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Aim of the study: This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of action of JWYCHT through network pharmacological analysis and experimental validation. Methods: NAFLD-related transcriptome data and target genes associated with JWYCHT were retrieved from public databases. Initially, candidate genes were obtained by overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from NAFLD and control samples in GSE63067 with the drug target genes. Subsequently, candidate biomarkers were further obtained using the algorithm in cytoHubba plug-in. Biomarkers were further identified via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and expression validation, and enrichment analysis was executed to explore the potential mechanisms of NAFLD biomarkers. HPLC and UPLC/QE-HFX were used to determine the chemical components of JWYCHT. Finally, the findings were validated through molecular biology experiments involving a mouse model of NAFLD induced by high-fat diet. Results: A total of 416 DEGs were acquired, with 51 candidate genes subjected to enrichment analysis. Seven candidate biomarkers, including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and caspase-1 (CASP1), were identified from an algorithm in cytoHubba plug-in. ROC analysis confirmed CASP1 and CXCL10 as viable biomarkers, with the latter (odds ratio = 1.305, p < 0.05) emerging as a risk factor for NAFLD. 41 compounds were identified by UPLC/QE-HFX in JWYCHT. The HPLC results demonstrated distinct variations in chemical profiles between JWYCHT, YCHT, and their component medicinal herbs. A series of molecular experiments revealed that JWYCHT effectively treated NAFLD in the mouse model. It can reduce the expressions of CXCL10 and CASP1, improve liver function biochemical indicators and histopathological changes, and alleviate inflammation and lipid deposition. Conclusion: Bioinformatics and experimental validation revealed that JWYCHT can alleviate hepatic inflammation and lipid deposition in NAFLD by reducing the expressions of CXCL10 and CASP1. Our research results offer an experimental foundation for the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of JWYCHT and guidance for its clinical application.

AB The Western Sichuan Plateau (WSP) is characterized by high altitude and intense solar radiation. Residents in this region have long been exposed to a stark contrast between strong outdoor light and dim indoor environments, leading to the development of unique perceptions of light comfort. To assess the genuine light comfort needs of local residents, this study focuses on Taoping Qiang Village in Lixian County, adopting a combined approach of on-site measurements and questionnaire surveys to analyze the light comfort perceptions of residents in traditional and modern residential buildings under varying illuminance levels. The results indicate that residents of traditional residential buildings are more adapted to low illuminance environments (50-150 lx), while those in modern residential buildings prefer higher illuminance levels (300-450 lx). The existing daylighting standard (no less than 300 lx) is not applicable to traditional residential buildings, as excessive illuminance may cause discomfort. The study recommends optimizing illuminance design in architectural lighting environments by tailoring solutions to different residential types and user needs, avoiding excessively high or low illuminance levels that compromise comfort. This research provides empirical evidence for light comfort studies in high-altitude regions and offers scientific guidance for local architectural lighting design.

AB Climate change significantly affects the geographic distribution patterns of plants. As a commonly used traditional herbal medicine, Swertia bimaculata has lacked research on its response to climate challenges. This study, for the first time, utilized the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS software to predict and analyze the suitable habitats for S. bimaculata in China across different periods. The results indicated that the annual precipitation (bio_12, 42.6%), min temperature of coldest month (bio_6, 28.5%), aspect (8.2%), slope (5.2%), and temperature annual range (bio_7, 3.2%) were the main environmental factors influencing the distribution of S. bimaculata in China. Under the current climate scenario, the suitable habitat for S. bimaculata was predicted to be 201.02 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for 20.94% of China's total land area, primarily distributed in the regions south of the Qinling-Huaihe line and east of the Hengduan Mountains. Under different future climate scenarios, the suitable area for S. bimaculata showed a significant expansion trend, with the centroid exhibiting a shift toward higher latitudes. This study provides scientific references for the rational introduction and cultivation of S. bimaculata in China.

ID SIDE MANAGEMENT
AB Demand response (DR) is a crucial mechanism for dynamically regulating electricity consumption in smart grids. Conventional DR studies often neglect the role of historical information on current decision-making and cost constraints providing users with an upper affordable threshold. This paper proposes a networked evolutionary game (NEG) model for DR that incorporates multi-step memory and cost constraints to more realistically capture user behavior. By employing the semi-tensor product method, the dynamics of the DR system is represented algebraically, enabling tractable analysis of equilibria and controller design. An optimization control strategy is developed to steer the system toward a desired state, reducing both total energy consumption and users' cost, while ensuring that individual costs remain within a predetermined threshold. The proposed approach provides an effective theoretical framework for DR implementation in smart grids.

AB Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has become a major challenge in clinical treatment due to its highly aggressive nature and limited therapeutic options. A carbon nanoparticles-Fe(ii) complex (CNSI-Fe), as both a ferroptosis inducer and photothermal agent (PTA), could exert anticancer effects through the ferroptosis pathway and photothermal action. Herein, we evaluated the photothermal therapeutic effects of CNSI-Fe in mice bearing the model tumor of TNBC (4T1 tumor). The therapeutic effects of CNSI-Fe were compared without/with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic mechanisms and biosafety were also investigated. CNSI-Fe exhibits excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. CNSI-Fe had significant cytotoxicity against TNBC cells, and photothermal therapy (PTT) further enhanced its antitumor effects. The combination of CNSI-Fe and PTT treatments exhibited a more pronounced tumor-suppressive effect and longer survival time comparing to single modality treatment. Mechanistic studies indicated that PTT facilitated the entry of iron ions from CNSI-Fe into cancer cells, generating more hydroxyl radicals and significantly enhancing the ferroptosis. The haematological and serum biological parameters associated with the histopathological observations indicated that the side-effects of CNSI-Fe were low during PTT. Overall, we evidenced the synergistic effect of CNSI-Fe chemotherapy and PTT for TNBC treatment with low toxicity.

AB Exploitation of stable & efficient FeNx-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key challenge in commercialization as an alternative for Pt/C catalyst. Herein, a series of carbon matrix hybridized iron phthalocyanine electrocatalysts (FePc#Cxs) were prepared for investigating the effect of various carbon matrix on ORR performance. All of the FePc#Cxs show comparable ORR activities to the commercial Pt/C. Impressively, the FePc#CKB exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.947 V and limited current density of 6.5 mA cm-2 in alkaline media, while achieves a maximum power density of 307.4 mW cm-2 in primary Zn-air battery, which is mainly contributed to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox enhancement in FePc#CKB created between FePc and Ketjen Black (KB) carbon matrix, leading to a faster ORR kinetics process and an increased ORR activity in FeN4 site. This work on regulating Fe2+/Fe3+ redox environment in FePc by carbon matrix might provide a valuable path to construct desired carbon-based catalysts, but not confined to ORR electrocatalyst.

AB Yak milk's stage-specific metabolic profiles remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, yak colostrum (YC) was found to contain higher levels of essential components (e.g., milk fat, lactose, lactoprotein and non-fat solids) than transitional (YT) and mature milk (YM). A comprehensive untargeted profiling was conducted using UHPLC-Q Exactive HF-X to investigate the metabolic signatures of YC, YT and YM. A total of 2005 metabolites were identified. Metabolites enriched in YC were implicated in promoting intestinal microbiota colonization and supporting neonatal immune defense and neurodevelopment. In contrast, YM exhibited a metabolomic profile associated with sustained energy metabolism and the maturation of adaptive immune responses. YT exhibited a hybrid profile containing select bioactives characteristic of both YC and YM stages. Metabolites in YC and YT showed dynamic changes associated with circadian rhythm regulation and cognitive function under high-altitude hypoxia. This study reveals lactation-stage dynamics and supports functional development of yak milk products.

AB Ultrasonic-assisted maceration offers a promising strategy to optimize flavor quality in fermented fruit wines, yet its application on kiwi wine (KW) remains unexplored. This study systematically investigated the impact of ultrasonic-assisted maceration on KW's metabolomics, flavoromics, sensory evaluation and antioxidant properties. 1H NMR identified 58 molecules in KW. Ultrasonic-assisted maceration significantly increased the concentrations of phenylalanine, acetoacetate, N,N-dimethylglycine, creatinine, and levulinate, while decreasing the levels of epicatechin, acetoin, cytidine, acetone, and hydroxyacetone. GC-IMS and GC-MS characterized 29 and 46 volatile molecules, respectively. The levels of esters and organic acids showed a direct proportionality to the intensity of the ultrasonic treatment, while an opposite trend was found for alcohols. Sensory scores of KW improved under the ultrasonic treatment. In detail, ultrasonic treatment for 40 min at 240 W led to the highest scores for taste-lasting and mouthfeel. A treatment of equal duration at 480 W led to the highest aroma score. Etongue effectively discriminated taste features brought to KW by the treatments. Moreover, ultrasonic treatments significantly enhanced KW's scavenging activity of DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals. This study provides theoretical references and basis for the application of ultrasonic-assisted maceration as a technique to potentially enhance the flavor quality of KW.

AB This paper explores how companies' ability to conceal its illicit activities impacts bribery in China. We find a positive relationship between corporate digital transformation (DT) and bribery. This finding is robust to several endogeneity and robustness tests. Channel tests show that decreased bribery costs explain the positive association between DT and corporate bribery. Specifically, the main effect is more pronounced for firms that operate in environments with high corruption or firms that face less media monitoring. Furthermore, we find that the impact of DT on bribery is more pronounced for multinational firms and those operating within highly competitive industries. This suggests that a firm's willingness to bribe is a prerequisite for their leveraging DT to engage in bribery. Collectively, our study highlights that DT can enhance corporate ability to conceal illicit activities, thereby exacerbating bribery behavior.

AB BackgroundTandem repeats (TRs) are major sources of genetic variation and important genetic markers. Their expansions are not only involved in gene expression regulation but also associated with many nervous system diseases and cancers. However, there is a lack of an efficient tandem repeat identification tool for seamless integration with larger bioinformatics programs developed with the popular Python language.ResultsWe introduce pytrf, a Python package for identification of both exact and approximate TRs from genomic sequences. It allows seamless embedding into other programs developed by Python or using in Python interactive environment and Jupyter notebooks. It also provides command line tools for assisting users to find tandem repeats from FASTA/Q files. Compared to other tools, the pytrf shows the highest performance in aspect of running time with comparable peak memory usage.ConclusionsPytrf provides simple interfaces and command line tools to facilitate identification of tandem repeats from genomic sequences. Pytrf can easily be installed from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pytrf) and the source code is freely available at https://github.com/lmdu/pytrf.

AB This study explored the relationship between perceived ethnic group continuity and the sense of community for the Chinese nation, and tested the mediating role of ethnic group identity among Han nationality and ethnic minorities in China. The study surveyed 3158 adolescents belonging to various ethnic groups (70 % females; Mage = 21.6 +/- 2.21 years), recruited using convenience sampling. The survey included the Perceived Ethnic Group Continuity Scale, Ethnic Group Identity Scale, a Psychological Scale for Chinese Nation Community Consciousness, and a selfmade demographic questionnaire. Results showed the perceived ethnic group continuity for Han nationality and ethnic minorities in China positively predicted their sense of community for the Chinese nation through the mediating effect of ethnic group identity. Perceived ethnic group continuity and ethnic group identity were found to promote the sense of community for the Chinese nation. 'Perceived Ethnic Group Continuity-Ethnic Group Identity Integration' theoretical model was constructed, providing a crucial psychological mechanism explanation for coordinating ethnic survival needs and national community building in global multi-ethnic states. Under the premise of fully respecting the cultural subjectivity of ethnic groups, cultivating perceptions of historical culture continuity, and constructing inclusive identity systems can effectively achieve compatible symbiosis between ethnic group and national identity. This discovery transcends the governance dilemma of 'separate coexistence' in traditional multiculturalism, offering an operational psychological pathway to resolve the structural tension between 'diversity' and 'unity' in multi-ethnic states. Current findings holds practical significance for China's social harmony and offers valuable references for the harmonious development of other multi-ethnic nations worldwide.

AB Climate warming is expected to contribute to the decline of arthropod species diversity and biomass around the world. However, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we report on a field experiment documenting arthropod species diversity and biomass responses to passive simulated warming for six consecutive years in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The field warming experiment consisted of six large open-top chambers (15 x 15 x 2.5 m), with three chambers warmed and three non-warmed, resulting in mean temperature differences of 0.18 degrees C and 0.57 degrees C in the growing season and the non-growing season, respectively. Warming decreased arthropod species diversity by 39% and arthropod biomass by 18% during the experiment. Specifically, the richness of large-bodied species decreased, while small-bodied species were not significantly affected. Moreover, the abundance of small-bodied species increased, but that of large-bodied ones decreased, resulting in decreases in community size spectrum and community-weighted mean body size under warming. Results of structural equation model suggest that the decreases in arthropod species diversity (represented by species richness and community size spectrum) and biomass were primarily caused by a warming-induced shift from forb- to graminoid-dominated plant communities, which could be attributed to a warming-induced decrease in soil moisture. Moreover, the warming effect on arthropod species diversity and biomass was more pronounced in later years of the experiment, which could be partly related to the increase in mean annual temperature over the course of the experiment and progressing shift in plant community species composition over time. Our study provides unique experimental evidence that even very modest warming may result in declines in both species diversity and biomass of arthropods through cascades of indirect effects, and identifies important mechanisms underlying biodiversity loss.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a crucial factor in determining meat quality, yet yak meat is typically characterized by low IMF levels. The epigenetic mechanisms underlying IMF deposition, particularly the role of super-enhancers (SEs), remain poorly understood. RNA-seq identified 66 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and 56 DE pri-miRNAs in yak longissimus dorsi with varying IMF contents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed 1209 SE-associated pri-miRNA genes and 2709 SE-associated mature miRNA genes with distinct histone modifications. These SEs not only enhance the transcription of miRNA genes but also affect the processing and maturation of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). H3K27ac-marked SEs regulated key miRNAs, including miR-1991, miR-2284b, miR-2284 ac, and miR-2285ay. Enrichment of muscle-specific transcription factors within H3K27ac-enriched regions, including USF1, KLF4, SMAD, and ATF, suggesting their role in regulating miRNA expression and muscle function. Functional studies confirmed that miR-2285ay, a SEassociated miRNA, promotes yak adipocyte differentiation through a series of cell and molecular biology experiments. Dual-luciferase assays demonstrated the regulatory role of SEs in miR-2285ay expression through the enhancer activity of their constituent regions. Our study provides preliminary insights into the epigenetic regulation of intramuscular fat deposition and provides a reference for improving yak beef quality through genetic improvement in the future.

AB The national ecological civilization pilot zone policy is a comprehensive and integrated innovation strategy for China's current ecological and environmental governance. Compared to conventional single-dimensional environmental regulation policies, the pilot zone policy has more diversified policy goals, richer policy implementation paths, and broader policy targets, exhibiting characteristics of composite policy portfolio. In this paper, the green total factor productivity of 283 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2021 was estimated based on the SBM-DEA model. And, the impact of the pilot zone policy on green total factor productivity was examined based on a difference-in-difference with multiple time periods model. The results show that the pilot zone policy significantly improved green total factor productivity in pilot provinces, mainly through the mediation effect of technological innovation and industrial restructuring. The conclusion still held after placebo test and robustness test.

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF) has been widely applied in many fields with unique structures and fantastic properties. Previous studies indicated that the toxicity of MOFs was determined by the metal centers. However, the distinct bio-effects of MOF materials in comparison with their central metals remained unknown. Therefore, four MOF-74 materials were synthesized using Co, Ni, Cu and Mg as central metals with the same organic ligands for toxicity evaluations on the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. Mg-MOF-74 slightly stimulated the bacterial growth, while Co/Ni/Cu-MOF-74 materials inhibited the growth of A. vinelandii with higher concentrations. Particularly, free ions of Mg, Co and Cu showed higher toxicity than Mg/Co/Cu-MOF-74, but Ni2+ and Ni-MOF-74 had similar inhibition effects. Mg-MOF-74 had slight impact on physiological growth and metabolism pathways of A. vinelandii. Ni-MOF-74 and Cu-MOF-74 inhibited the nitrogen fixation process and down-regulated genes in glycolysis and regulation of organelle organization of A. vinelandii. Surprisingly, Co-MOF-74 enhanced the nitrogen fixation process by upregulating the ATP generation and metabolic process, organonitrogen compound metabolic process, oxidative phosphorylation and catalytic activity to supply adequate energy for nitrogen fixation process. Additionally, the released Co2+ from Co-MOF-74 synthesized cobalamin intracellularly to promote the electron transfer in nitrogen fixation process.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Santali Albi Lignum (SA), the dry heartwood of the trunk of Santalum album L., was originally discovered in India. It has a long history of use in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), mainly to treat skin, cardiovascular and lung diseases. In recent years, SA has received worldwide attention because of its diverse pharmacological effects, including anti-tumour, neuroprotective and gastrointestinal regulatory effects. Purpose: This paper aims to systematically review progress in the research on SA, focusing on its ethnopharmacology, phytochemical ingredients, pharmacological effects, quality control and clinical applications; directions for further research and development of this herbal medicine are also discussed. Methods: Information on SA was obtained mainly from published materials, classic ancient books on TCM and electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science China National Knowledge Infrastructure and traditional Chinese medicine classics). Results: A total of 216 molecules have been identified in SA, including terpenoids, fatty acids, organic acids, phenols, aldehydes, alkanes, esters, ketones, steroids, alcohols, phenylpropanoids and other compounds, of which sesquiterpenes have emerged as the primary bioactive ingredients. A wide spectrum of biological activities of extracts or compounds of SA, including neuroprotective, antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and gastrointestinal effects, have been verified in in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies. Quality is monitored by the quantification and identification of alpha & hybull;santalol, beta & hybull;santalol and volatile oils. TCM formulations that contain SA are commonly used to treat coronary heart disease, heart failure, ischaemic stroke, skin diseases and others. Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates that modern bioactivities and clinical research reports provide scientific evidence for the efficacy of SA, especially the ability to circulate qi and alleviate pain. Current studies have focused mainly on the chemical composition and pharmacological effects of the volatile oil fraction of SA. Moreover, the integrated pharmacological mechanisms of the active compounds and extracts of SA still need to be comprehensively elucidated. Furthermore, research on its toxicology and pharmacokinetics should be expanded to ensure the reasonable and safe clinical use of SA.

AB Excessive fluorine accumulation poses a significant threat to soil ecology and even human health, yet its impact on soil fauna, especially earthworms, remains poorly understood. This study employed multi-omics and biomarkers to investigate high fluorine-induced biochemical changes that cause tissue damages in Eisenia fetida. The results demonstrated that earthworms exhibited obvious damage with fluorine addition exceeding 200 mg kg(-1), with stress levels escalating as fluorine contents increased. Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that fluorine could upregulate genes encoding mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-III and downregulate those for IV-V, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation despite antioxidant system activation. The resulting ROS interfered with deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis, prompting homologous recombination as the main DNA repair mechanism. Additionally, fluorine-induced ROS also attacked and disrupted protein and lipid related metabolisms ultimately causing oxidative damages. These cumulative oxidative damages from high fluorine contents subsequently triggered autophagy or apoptosis, resulting in tissue ulceration and epithelial exfoliation. Therefore, high fluorine could threaten earthworms by inducing ROS accumulation and subsequent biomolecule damages.

AB Sexual dimorphism plays a critical role in disease pathophysiology, but the subtlety and complexity of these differences, along with a lack of precise comparative methods, hinder the advancement of precision medicine and drug development. This limitation is particularly evident in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), where sex-specific molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we employed an advanced integrative N-glycoproteomics and proteomics approach to systematically analyze sex-biased molecular signatures in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) under healthy and MASLD conditions. Our analysis identified 280 sex-biased proteins and 39 sex-biased N-glycosites, and KEGG enrichment revealed that female-biased molecules were primarily involved in lipid metabolism, while male-biased molecules were associated with inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling. A combined dataset of 302 sex-biased molecules was further analyzed using protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and Rc value calculations, resulting in the identification of 21 hub proteins and 2 hub N-glycosites as MASLD-associated sex-biased signatures. Notably, MASLD amplified proteomic sex differences while attenuating them in N-glycosylation. Western blot validation of key signatures, including female-biased MVK and male-biased LGALS3, highlighted distinct molecular adaptations between the sexes in MASLD progression. Our study introduced an advanced analytical framework for high-resolution comparative molecular profiling by integrating N-glycoproteomics with proteomics, providing valuable insights into sex-biased molecular signatures, enhancing preclinical model development, and advancing sex-specific therapeutic strategies in MASLD research and broader biological systems.

ID DOPAMINE
AB In this paper, a wearable flexible patch featuring a non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor based on Cu singleatom catalysts (SACs) anchored on bipyridine-covalent organic framework (COF) electrode was proposed for specific detection of acetaminophen (AP) in human sweat. The electrode modified material is Cu single atom catalytic material (Cu-TpBpy). The bifunctional TpBpy acts as a support for binding individual Cu atoms through abundant and well-organized N-N chelating sites, while simultaneously serving as an active host for specific recognition/adsorption of AP due to its porous structure and active N sites. The resulting Cu-TpBpy with atomically dispersed Cu sites demonstrated high electrochemical activity for AP, attributed to enhanced electron transfer efficiency and reduced binding and adsorption energies. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the Cu single-atom anchoring on TpBpy provides superior adsorption of AP than TpBpy alone, resulting in lower binding energy, and higher selectivity and sensitivity. The wearable flexible patch, based on Cu-TpBpy, enabled real-time and accurate detection of AP in human sweat and achieved a linear range of 0.3 mu M5 mu M and a limit of detection of 13 nM, with satisfied stability and repeatability. This work developed a highly sensitive non-enzymatic sensing method for wearable flexible patches.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the alkaloids of Tibetan medicine Corydalis conspersa Maxim. and their hepatoprotective effect against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced acute liver injury (ALI). The ethanol extract of this herbal medicine was subjected to a phytochemical study. Network pharmacology (NP) and molecular docking were used to predict the active constituents and mechanism of action against ALI. Seven alkaloid components were isolated and identified from this herb medicine, including acetylcorynoline (1, ACE), corynoline (2), scoulerine (3), protopine (4), bulbocapnine (5, BBC), palmatine (6), and isocorydine (7, ISO), among which compounds 1, 3, and 5 were isolated from this plant for the first time. Pharmacological experiments have shown that compounds 1, 5, 7, and the total alkaloids (TTA) of the plant exhibit good improvement effects on CCl4-induced ALI in mice. NP and molecular docking predicted that their mechanism of action may be related to targets such as STAT3, SRC, EGFR, PIK3CA, and HSP90AA1. These research findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of the medicinal value of Tibetan medicine Corydalis conspersa Maxim.

AB Mulberry, an edible and medicinal fruit rich in polyphenolic compounds that improve gut health and metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, the effects of mulberry polyphenols (MP) against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain unknown. This study aimed at utilizing 16s rRNA sequencing, network pharmacology combined transcriptomics technologies to explore the effects and molecular mechanisms of MP on NAFLD. Based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-HRMS) analysis, 40 chemical ingredients were identified in MP. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Choline deficient, L amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) for six weeks to induce a NAFLD model and treated with MP at low (1 g/kg), medium (2 g/kg) and high (4 g/kg) doses. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed that MP significantly rectified serum biochemical indicators of liver function and lipid metabolism in NAFLD mice. Histopathological evaluation manifested MP was able to attenuate lipid accumulation, reduce hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates. Integrated network pharmacology and liver transcriptome sequencing revealed that MP regulated genes and signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory response, such as PI3K-Akt, and related core proteins (PI3K, Akt, p-P3K, p-Akt, Nur77, and p21) were further validated by western blotting. Additionally, 16s rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that MP treatment effectively remodeled intestinal microbiota imbalances by reducing possibly harmful bacteria (Romboutsia and Roseburia) and promote potential beneficial bacteria (Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidota). Collectively, this study depicted the comprehensive mechanisms though which MP can alleviate NAFLD, which highlights the nutritional value of MP as a dietary adjuvant for the treatment of NAFLD.

DE dense deposition; flame retardant; ion-dipole interactions; Li metal;

AB Uncontrolled lithium (Li) deposition can lead to the formation of dendrites and "dead" Li, accelerating the degradation of cycling stability and safety performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve dense Li deposition and flame-retardant by designing an electrolyte based on localized strong ion-dipole (LSID) interactions. The strong ion-dipole interactions between the multiple-dipole solvent (G4), NO3-, FSI-, and Li+ promote the formation of Li+ primary solvation sheaths for stabilizing Li deposition behavior. While the weak dipole fluorine-containing diluent (TTE) is distributed in the secondary solvation sheath due to weak ion-dipole interactions of Li+-TTE to improve interfacial wettability and flame retardancy due to preferential separation. Consequently, the localized strong ion-dipole interactions strategy in the designed electrolyte successfully achieves a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% for Li||Cu cells, and ultrathin Li-matched Li||LFP and Li||NCM523 cells also demonstrate excellent cycling stability, as well as an improved safety performance of LMBs.

AB The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, characterized by a cold climate and prolonged heating periods, presents an opportunity for energy conservation through the implementation of a multi-energy complementary system that primarily utilizes solar energy, supplemented by electric heating. Despite the region's abundant solar resources, challenges such as uneven spatial and temporal distribution of solar energy, supply-demand mismatches, and complex control strategies persist. Moreover, existing research lacks long-term evaluations of heating systems' operational effectiveness in this area. To address these issues, this paper proposes a household energy system that meets heating, lighting, and hot water needs for remote rural households, using a photovoltaic (PV) and electric heating phase change thermal storage wall. An experimental platform in the Lhasa area enables measurements during the heating season, facilitating the development of a control strategy and an energy efficiency evaluation method. The assessment reveals that the system can achieve an operational efficiency of 71.4 %, with solar energy contributing 100 % to the heating branch, thus eliminating grid electricity consumption for heating. Additionally, the system reaches working and overall conversion efficiencies of 16.6 % and 84.1 %, respectively, while optimizing the thermal storage layer to about 2 cm to reduce investment costs. This research offers valuable insights for promoting energy-saving practices in buildings across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to obtain goat CRTC2 gene sequence and elucidate its biological properties, and further study the impact of overexpression and interference of CRTC2 on the cell differentiation of goat subcutaneous precursor adipocytes. Methods: The sequence of goat CRTC2 was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and its molecular characterization was analyzed. The expression of CRTC2 gene in goat tissues and subcutaneous precursor adipocytes differentiated from 0 to 120 h was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of CRTC2 on the subcutaneous precursor adipocyte differentiation were investigated by using liposome transfection, Bodipy, Oil Red O staining and qPCR. Results: The results showed that the cloned goat CRTC2 gene was 2363 bp long (coding sequence [CDS] 2082 bp), encoding 693 amino acids. The relative expression levels of CRTC2 gene were highest in liver and then in kidney (P < 0.05). During differentiation, the highest expression of CRTC2 in subcutaneous precursor adipocytes was observed at 120 of differentiating (P < 0.01). In addition, we found that overexpression of CRTC2 significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes (C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, PPAR gamma, DGAT1, DGAT2, ACC, FASN, SREBP1,AP2,LPL,ATGL) and promoted lipid accumulation. We then chemically synthesized goat CRTC2 small interfering RNA and transfected it into goat subcutaneous precursor adipocytes. The results revealed that SiRNA-mediated interference with CRTC2 significantly inhibited its differentiation and suppressed lipid droplet aggregation. Conclusion: So, this study indicates that CRTC2 is a positive regulator that promoting cell differentiation of subcutaneous adipocyte in goats, which lays the foundation for an in-depth study of the role of CRTC2 in lipid deposition in goats.

AB China's fertility continues to decline. Identifying the underlying explanations for that decline involves multiple and interwoven threads which we explore with data from the China household finance survey (CHFS). We examine the declining fertility in China through the lens of urban-rural transformations, and synthesize the roles of women's education, women's labor market participation and child-raising costs, and suggest that China is a distinctive variant of the second demographic transition. The analysis shows that urbanization and the convergence of rural and urban fertility levels have been key drivers of the overall decline in fertility rates. And it confirms what we have long known that women's education and labor market participation both negatively impact the likelihood of having children. The study also suggests that intergenerational support can serve as a basis for effective policy interventions to address China's declining fertility rate.

AB The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) has emerged as a core architecture for future intelligent communication due to its wide-area coverage and dynamic heterogeneous characteristics. However, its high latency, dynamic topology, and privacy-security challenges severely constrain the application of Federated Learning (FL). This paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning framework for SAGIN (PPFL-SAGIN), which for the first time integrates differential privacy, adaptive transfer learning, and bi-level reinforcement learning to systematically address data heterogeneity, device dynamics, and privacy leakage in SAGINs. Specifically, (1) an adaptive knowledge-sharing mechanism based on transfer learning is designed to balance device heterogeneity and data distribution divergence through dynamic weighting factors; (2) a bi-level reinforcement learning device selection strategy is proposed, combining meta-learning and hierarchical attention mechanisms to optimize global-local decision-making and enhance model convergence efficiency; (3) dynamic privacy budget allocation and robust aggregation algorithms are introduced to reduce communication overhead while ensuring privacy. Finally, experimental evaluations validate the proposed method. Results demonstrate that PPFL-SAGIN significantly outperforms baseline solutions such as FedAvg, FedAsync, and FedAsyncISL in terms of model accuracy, convergence speed, and privacy protection strength, verifying its effectiveness in addressing privacy preservation, device selection, and global aggregation in SAGINs.

AB Cave dwellings in the Loess Plateau and western Henan region are ancient architectural forms that offer significant potential for rural revitalization and cultural heritage preservation. This study examines their role in Mogou Village through field surveys and mathematical analysis, highlighting their contributions to urban-rural integration, rural tourism, and cultural sustainability. Key findings include the mean radiant temperature (MRT) in cave dwellings remaining stable between 22.7-25.9 degrees C, facilitating lower indoor temperatures in summer. These dwellings maintain an APMV within the Class I thermal environment (-0.5 <= APMV <= 0.5), achieving a 90% satisfaction rate for thermal comfort. Despite excellent thermal insulation, improvements in ventilation design are necessary. Moreover, cave dwellings attract urban residents, fostering urban-rural integration and rural tourism development. They also preserve cultural heritage through traditional construction techniques and philosophical thought. Preserving local characteristics while protecting traditions is essential for social harmony, economic development, and cultural inheritance, supporting sustainable urban-rural integration.

TI High piezoelectric performance in KNN-based ceramics with multiphase

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C

ID LEAD-FREE PIEZOCERAMICS; HIGH-TEMPERATURE
AB As monitoring techniques are increasingly used in extreme environments, performance in extremely cold regions becomes a critical issue for sensing materials and devices. Due to reduced polarity and poor polarization rotation under external fields, optimizing the piezoelectric response remains challenging. Herein, rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phase boundary was successfully formed at -50 to 50 degrees C, with decreased phase transition temperatures in potassium sodium niobate ceramics. High polarity and enhanced polarization rotation were revealed with the R-O-T phase boundary, which was attributed to the refined domain structure and lowered polarization anisotropy, both of which could flatten the polarization energy barrier. Consequently, large piezoelectric properties (d33 = 300-420 pC N-1, kp = 0.36-0.38), along with improved ferroelectricity, were achieved at -40 to 50 degrees C for the samples, which were superior to those of pure phase or rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phase boundary compositions. This study demonstrates a strategy for developing high-performance piezoelectric materials suitable for extremely cold regions, facilitating the application of monitoring techniques in plateau environments.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hanchuan Zupa Granule(HCZP) is a classic Uygur medicine compound with a long history and proven efficacy. They have been included in the National Essential Medicines List of China and are commonly used in the treatment of asthma. It is of significant importance to elucidate its mechanisms through modern pharmacological research. Aim of the study: This study proposes a comprehensive research approach combining "disease circadian rhythmdrug target prediction-drug efficacy validation" to explore the optimal timing and mechanism of asthma treatment by examining the relationship between disease, medication, and time, supplemented by experimental investigations. Materials and methods: (R) Network pharmacology predicted the targets and mechanisms of HCZP's immune modulation in asthma. (R) Preliminary research on antiasthmatic medication times from ancient and modern sources identified the most frequent time, which was used for grouping in this study. An ovalbumin-induced asthma model and the lung pathology, pulmonary function, and bronchial obstruction were used to detect the lung condition of asthmatic mice. Serum and lung tissue were analyzed for immunoglobulins and Th2 cytokines. MUC5AC mRNA and protein levels, along with mucus staining, were measured to evaluate airway mucus secretion. Results: (R) Network pharmacological analyses showed that among the immune response-related pathways, the IL17 signalling pathway had the highest aggregation and was associated with Th2 cells in asthma pathogenesis. (R) In biological effect experiments, HCZP of all time subgroups could delay the progression of asthma pathology to a certain extent, increased FVC, FEV75, PEF, MMEF, IC to different degrees, and down-regulated IgE and Th2 characteristic cytokine expression. In terms of reducing mucus expression, the expression of MUC5AC was inhibited to varying degrees. In the treatment of asthma, the reasonable time to take the medicine is "evening (before going to bed)"

AB A new analytical method was developed for the rapid detection of metal-containing ionic liquids (MCILs) using the natural products (NPs) as fluorescent probes. Based on electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution and conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) simulation, the possible interactions between quercetin, emodin, curcumin, esculetin and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole tetrachloroferrate ([Bmim][FeCl4]) were predicted, and the ultraviolet response, concentration titration experiments and fluorescence response of NPs and [Bmim][FeCl4] were studied. Both theoretical and experimental studies indicated that esculetin showed the best corresponding performance to [Bmim][FeCl4] and then was selected as fluorescent probe molecule for the detection of a series of similar ionic liquids containing Zn2+, Cu2+ and Al3+. The linear range of this analytical method towards [Bmim][FeCl4] was 5 similar to 30 mu M (R-2 = 0.9957) with the relative standard deviation of 2.1 % and the limit of detection (LOD) of 1.08 mu M. Recoveries, measured in the standard ethanol solution with the added concentration of 5 mu M, were determined as 98.1 similar to 102.5 % by the standard addition method. According to all the studied results, the probe of natural product possessed good selectivity, repeatability, and stability, which could be fixed onto filter paper to detect [Bmim][FeCl4] in more intuitive way.

AB Context: Detecting potential vulnerabilities is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of software systems. Traditional static detection methods fall short in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection models typically rely on single sequence or graph embedding methods, neglecting the semantic and structured information present in the code. With the diversification of software development environments, systems often involve multiple programming languages. This limits the effectiveness of existing vulnerability detection methods when handling cross-language code. Objective: To solve these problems, we propose a more effective and general vulnerability detection framework, VDMAF(Cross-Language Source Code Vulnerability Detection Using Multi-Head Attention Fusion). Methods: The method extracts unified and standardized feature representations. It uses a multi-head attention module to fuse sequence features and graph structural features. First, an improved global consistent labeling mechanism is introduced, which improves data representation through threshold-based label augmentation. Second, the method uses sequence embedding to extract local semantic features of the code. The code is converted into a unified, standardized graph structure. Then, a graph neural network is used to extract features. Finally, the sequence and graph features are fused using the multi-head attention module, followed by classification with a bidirectional LSTM-based recurrent neural network. Results: VDMAF has been evaluated on three vulnerability datasets across different programming languages and granularities, demonstrating better performance across all metrics compared to baseline models, with F1 scores of 98.9%, 65.3%, and 56.8%. Conclusion: The proposed VDMAF outperforms state-of-the-art models, exhibiting better generality and scalability, thus showing greater potential in vulnerability detection tasks.

AB Supported platinum (Pt) catalysts are crucial for thermal CO2 reduction, yet traditional preparation methods often yield low catalytic activity. This study addresses this challenge by developing a photochemical deposition method to synthesize highly efficient Pt/TiO2 catalysts (Pt/TiO2-L) using only water as the solvent. The Pt/TiO2-L catalyst exhibited significantly higher CO2 conversion rates as 65 % at 600 degrees C and operational stability compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. TEM result revealed uniform dispersion of small Pt nanoparticles (around 1 nm) on the TiO2 support. XPS analysis showed a higher Pt surface content in Pt/TiO2-L, resulting in more active sites for CO2 reduction. In-situ CO-DRIFTS confirmed enhanced CO adsorption on Pt/TiO2-L due to its higher surface Pt content. This work demonstrates that the photochemical route is an effective and simple method for synthesizing efficient Pt/TiO2 catalysts for thermal CO2 reduction, offering promising prospects for industrial application in green chemistry.

AB This study presents the design of two high-gain omnidirectional antennas with minimal pattern ripple. Antenna I is based on a conventional microstrip patch structure, while Antenna II integrates a modified design with four metal probes. Characteristic mode theory (CMT) was applied to analyze the far-field radiation patterns of both antennas, with a focus on the distinct radiation modes. The analysis revealed that Antenna I operates in the TM22 mode and Antenna II in the quasi-TM11 mode, both exhibiting omnidirectional radiation characteristics. A comparative investigation of four different feeding techniques was conducted to ensure equal amplitude and phase excitation at each port, resulting in a low pattern ripple for both designs. A 1:4 power divider was implemented to validate the designs, and the performance of Antennas I and II was experimentally assessed. The measurement results showed that the -10 dB operating bandwidths of Antennas I and II spanned 2.42-2.50 GHz and 2.34-2.57 GHz, respectively, with corresponding peak gains of 8.0 dBi and 4.55 dBi at a frequency of 2.45 GHz.

TI SIRT5 Regulates Lipid Deposition in Goat Preadipocytes via

AB Silent Information Regulator 5 (SIRT5) has been established as a crucial regulator of cellular alanylation modification. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT5 plays a significant regulatory role in key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and fatty acid oxidation, all of which are closely associated with cellular lipid metabolism. Despite these advancements, the specific role of SIRT5 in regulating intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in goats, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we cloned the complete coding sequence of the goat SIRT5 gene and, through amino acid sequence alignment, demonstrated its closest phylogenetic relationship with sheep. Additionally, we characterized the higher expression of SIRT5 during the differentiation of goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. The silencing of SIRT5 by siRNA-mediated knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes and enhanced lipid deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Concurrently, SIRT5 deficiency led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and a marked reduction in apoptosis. Interestingly, although overexpression of SIRT5 promoted cell proliferation, it did not significantly alter lipid deposition in goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identified a total of 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following SIRT5 silencing in goat preadipocytes, predominantly involved in the Focal adhesion, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Notably, we successfully reversed the phenotypic effects observed in SIRT5 knockdown goat precursor adipocytes by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways using the AKT inhibitor LY294002 and the p38 MAPK pathway inhibitor PD169316, respectively. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that SIRT5 may modulate intramuscular fat deposition in goats through PI3k-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. These results expand the gene regulatory network associated with IMF formation and provide a theoretical foundation for improving meat quality by targeting IMF deposition.

AB The prohibition zone policy restricts certain activities in specific areas to protect the environment, while the emission permit policy allows companies to trade emissions permits as a market-based approach to regulation. Can the two policies jointly promote the carbon emission reduction of the pig breeding industry (PBI)? Based on the panel data of 31 provinces and cities in China from 2010 to 2020, this paper adopts propensity score matching and multi-period difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) models to study the impact of the dual policy of the prohibition zone and emission permit on the carbon emissions of the PBI. Our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the dual policy significantly reduces carbon emissions in the PBI. A mediating analysis reveals that industrial structure and government penalties regulate the impact of the dual policy. Further analysis shows that the prohibition zone policy and the emission permit policy play a synergistic role in the impact on the carbon emissions of the PBI. Regional heterogeneity is also explored, indicating that the carbon emission reduction effect is more significant in western China. Policy implementers should fully consider various policies, regional differences, and regulatory factors, formulating complementary policy combinations to jointly promote the green new quality productivity of the PBI.

AB Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have heightened concerns about data privacy. While differential privacy is commonly used in federated learning to protect model parameters, a significant challenge remains: balancing user privacy with model performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, the Federated Learning Method Based on Adaptive Differential Privacy and Homomorphic Encryption (ADPHE-FL), to address these challenges. The proposed scheme dynamically adjusts the privacy budget across communication rounds, offering a more flexible and efficient privacy management mechanism. Additionally, a mean-k parameter clipping algorithm is introduced to reduce transmitted data efficiently, optimizing model training and significantly enhancing both communication efficiency and system performance. A two-layer privacy protection strategy is employed to ensure secure aggregation while mitigating issues related to data utility degradation and high computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate that, with a privacy budget of 1, ADPHE-FL outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, achieving a 2% accuracy improvement over CLFLDP and 18% over DP-FL on the CIFAR-10 dataset at convergence. Furthermore, with a key length of 1024, encryption time efficiency improves by 89.3%, and decryption time efficiency by 82.6%, compared to the traditional Homomorphic Encryption-based FedAvg method.

AB Global population aging has intensified health challenges for older adults, yet research gaps persist on how rural human settlements mechanically influence elderly health through gender-differentiated perspectives. Leveraging data from the 2024 Rural Environment and Elderly Health Survey (1,084 seniors across 42 counties in Sichuan Province, China), this study employs structural equation modeling to analyze the complex relationships among rural human settlements, walking exercise, neighborhood interaction, and physical function of older adults. Results demonstrate that improved rural human settlements, regular walking, and active social interactions play a collective role in enhancing elderly physical function. Both physical and social behaviors mediate rural human settlements impacts, with social behaviors showing stronger mediation. Notably, the study indicates that rural human settlements exert a more pronounced impact on the physical function of elderly women. While physical activities primarily enhance the physical function of elderly men, the well-being of elderly women is significantly more influenced by social behaviors. The findings advocate prioritizing rural settlement improvements in Sichuan through activity-friendly village spaces and gender-sensitive environmental planning. This study offers actionable insights for enhancing elderly health outcomes while contributing empirical evidence from China to inform global aging initiatives and rural development strategies in developing regions.

The structure of probe BTD was characterized using IR, NMR, and HRMS. Experimental results demonstrate that the fluorescence of BTD significantly increases upon the introduction of H2S, resulting in a distinct color change from colorless to bright orange-red. The detection capability of BTD for H2S was assessed using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The probe shows significant fluorescence enhancement and can detect H2S quantitatively over a concentration range of 0 to 14 mu M, with a low detection limit of 44.85 nM. Furthermore, BTD exhibits excellent recovery rates and accuracy, indicating its practicality for H2S analysis in real samples.

AB In the context of massive urbanization and growing public demand for sustainable development, the new concept of eco-city regeneration has been arsing increasing attention in developing countries like. However, unlike new constructions, due to the existing buildings and spaces limitations, traditional greening design methods are often not feasible to meet the old renovation requirements for eco-city regeneration and low carbon urbanization. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative vertical greening design solution to renovate old public buildings. As a typical illustrative example, a public market in Chengdu, China, was retrofitted with a full vertical green curtain wall, to find a natural based solution to current problems such as outdated facilities, poor ventilation and facade fading according to the field investigation and site survey. In this design roadshow, regional analysis, practical renovation strategy and carbon emission evaluation are conducted, with local wood and green plants selected as alternative ecological materials for eco-renewal. Preliminary design results show that by increasing the original 20 % green coverage ratio to 47 %, such low-rise public buildings can be revitalized and coexist harmoniously with the surrounding environment. Life cycle carbon indicators show that after the renovation of low-carbon old public buildings, the carbon emissions can be significantly reduced by about 19.7 tCO2. Among them, building material production, construction and demolition stages are the main sources of building carbon emissions. This study provides new perspectives for modern green design concepts and management of traditional old buildings renovation, and offers novel application prototype reference for eco city regeneration in developing world.

AB BACKGROUND: Pongamol is a flavonoid natural product containing a 1,3-dicarbonyl structure, which has various biological activities and plays an important role as the main skeleton in new drug development. 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds are not only widely used as synthetic building blocks in many organic reactions, but also commonly found in natural products and active molecules in pharmaceuticals. Sixty-one dicarbonyl derivatives were designed and synthesized using the 1,3-dicarbonyl active fragment as a structural unit and their antifungal activities against six agricultural plant pathogens were determined. The compound ET-17 with the most significant activity against Botrytis cinerea was finally selected to study its preliminary mechanism of action. RESULTS: Most fluorinated compounds exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against fungi. Among them, compounds ET-6, ET-17, EFM-6, EFM-7, EFM-8, BZ-11 and BZ-12 exhibited remarkable antifungal activity in vitro against plant pathogenic fungi. Especially, compound ET-17 displayed the broad-spectrum antifungal activities against Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium graminearum, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum and Phytophthora capsici with EC50 values of 0.740, 0.635, 0.640, 1.732, 4.515 and 1.984 mu g/mL, respectively. Further mechanism research results indicated that compound ET-17 might cause mycelial abnormality, cell membrane breakage, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of B. cinerea to inhibit mycelial growth. Furthermore, the in vivo protection experiments showed that compound ET-17 had a certain protective effect (72.23%) at 100 mu g/mL. CONCLUSION: The 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives showed efficient and broad-spectrum antifungal activities against six plant pathogens, which is expected to become a new broad-spectrum bactericidal candidate for controlling plant diseases.

AB In traditional Vehicle-to-Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2V2I) routing algorithms, the beacon power of vehicles remains fixed, lacking adaptability to dynamic adjustments based on events or on-demand operational modes, leading to poor dynamic adaptability of vehicles and significant energy wastage. To enhance the flexibility of beacon power adjustment for vehicles in dynamic environments, while considering practical factors such as the signal coverage status, selfishness, and motion characteristics of routing vehicles, a self-adaptive V2V2I routing algorithm named Adaptive Beacon Power Routing algorithm(ABPR) is proposed. In the algorithm, in order to enhance the stability of the vehicle's connection to RSU, vehicles first collect neighbor beacons and analyze the current signal coverage status of the vehicle. Subsequently, they adaptively adjust the beacon power of the vehicle, and then analyze available neighbor vehicle nodes through improved Q-learning, searching for the optimal neighbor node and selecting it as the next-hop route. Simulation experiments conducted on the Cologne dataset demonstrate that compared to RSAR and GPSR algorithms, the ABPR algorithm achieves an average improvement of 15% in residual energy consumption, 13.79% in selfish vehicle count, 38.58% in routing hop count, and 51.37% in routing link lifetime proportion under +/- 30% standard beacon power conditions. This algorithm enhances the flexibility of beacon power adjustment in VANET environments while optimizing the overall data offloading link quality.

AB In the context of 6G networks, efficient information transmission at high speeds with large data volumes to the cloud poses technical challenges, particularly related to data type heterogeneity and information security. This is especially critical when dealing with extensive data from diverse users, leading to issues in data utilization efficiency and security. To tackle these challenges, an innovative approach has been developed, employing the following data processing methods: (1) Users utilize the Mobile Edge Computing server to train the initial model, sign and upload it to the Blockchain. Due to constraints in data block size, off-chain storage is implemented using InterPlanetary File System. Additionally, differential privacy technology safeguards user privacy during this process; (2) Addressing the vast multi-source heterogeneous data in the 6G network, the Federated Transfer Learning mode is employed. This involves combining cross-user characteristics in different business formats after the data processing center acquires user data. Blockchain replaces the centralized aggregator in the federated learning system, enhancing the security of data transmission. By utilizing actual datasets from sources such as sandstorm, typhoon, and flood data, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly enhances data utilization efficiency, improves the security of data transmission, predicts disasters, and minimizes disaster losses.

AB This study investigated tick species and spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) infection rates in ticks from yaks in Jiulong County, Sichuan Province, China. Firstly, ticks collected from yaks were meticulously classified through morphological identification. Subsequently, the total DNA of ticks was extracted, and specific partial sequences of their ITS-2 region, as well as the ompA and ompB genes of SFGR, were amplified using PCR. The positive PCR products were sequenced and compared thoroughly against the NCBI database. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted for ITS-2, ompA, and ompB to determine the species of tick and the SFGR. The results revealed that a total of 585 ticks were collected, with the most abundant species being R. microplus, which accounted for 52.65% (308/585) of the total and was followed by I. ovatus (32.99%, 193/585), I. acutitarsus (8.89%, 52/585), and D. everestianus (5.50%, 32/585). Furthermore, SFGR was detected in 63.93% (374/585) of the ticks. Notably, the infection rate of SFGR in semi-agricultural and pastoral areas was significantly higher at 70.60%, compared to 45.10% in pastoral areas (p < 0.01). Overall, this study marks the first investigation into the prevalence of SFGR in Jiulong County and highlights the high infection rate of SFGR in ticks, with R. raoultii being the predominant species.

AB The plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is a predominant small burrowing herbivore that plays a vital role within the alpine meadow ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This investigation centered on delineating the variances in bioturbation impacts by plateau pikas on soil characteristics in alpine meadows under distinct population densities. Outcomes indicated notable discrepancies in SOC, TC, and TN levels between surface soil depth (0-10 cm) and deeper depth (10-20 cm) under different Active Burrow Density (ABD). Across different depths, SOC, TC, and TN concentrations exhibited an initial rise followed by a decline with escalating Active Burrow Density (ABD), reaching peaks within the range of 240-330 burrows per hectare. Additionally, SOC and TN levels displayed synchronized fluctuations across different depths, while TC levels did not exhibit such synchronicity; TC content in deeper depth lagged behind that in surface depth. Moreover, surface soil stoichiometry (C:N ratio) diminished with heightened ABD, whereas deeper depth exhibited an opposing trend. These findings underscore how plateau pika bioturbation reshape nutrient distribution patterns and soil stoichiometry, thereby influencing carbon turnover processes and cycling rates. Drawing upon these findings, the study concludes that moderating plateau pika population density within reasonable thresholds, offers greater promise in stabilizing nutrient cycling processes in alpine meadow and upholding ecological equilibrium.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate target gene expression in many eukaryotes. MiRNAs are essential for post-transcriptional regulation, influencing various biological functions, including oocyte growth and maturation, fertilization, early embryo development, and implantation. In recent decades, numerous studies have identified a substantial number of miRNAs associated with mammalian oocyte maturation and early embryo development, utilizing methods such as small RNA sequencing and modulating miRNA expression through overexpression or inhibition. In this review, we introduce the biosynthesis of miRNAs and their regulatory roles in germ cells, summarizing the expression patterns and post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs during bovine oocyte maturation and early embryo development, as well as their potential application in bovine assisted reproductive technology (ART).

DE Goat pneumonia; Metaviromic; Metagenomic; Inflammatory factor
AB Goats are an economically important livestock species in China. However, the high mortality rate due to pneumonia represents a significant challenge to the development of intensive goat farms. 10 goat lung tissue samples were collected in this study, and all samples exhibited pneumonia of different severity as determined by lung lesion scoring and histopathological examination. Subsequently, this study employed qRT-PCR to measure the relative expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue, and conducted metaviromic and metagenomic analyses to elucidate the structure and composition of the pulmonary microbiota, the correlation between the abundance of specific microbes and inflammatory factors, and between microbial abundance and the expression of virulence genes. Metaviromic results indicated that Ungulate tetraparvovirus 4 (83.3 %) had the highest relative abundance in the viral composition. Metagenomic data showed that Mycoplasma (28.2 %) and Streptococcus (24.8 %) are the primary dominant genus in goat pneumonia. Notably, a total of 8 pathogens associated with pneumonia in humans or animals were identified across all samples, including Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Bordetella hinzii, Bibersteinia trehalosi, Bordetella pertussis, and Pasteurella multocida, with mixed infections with multiple pathogens are very common in this study. Correlation analysis indicates a significant association between the degree of pathogen coinfection and the severity of pulmonary lesions. Furthermore, Pasteurella multocida showed a significant positive correlation with the expression of IL-6 (P< 0.01). The pneumonia samples also revealed a multitude of virulence factors associated with bacterial pathogenicity including those related to biofilm formation, endotoxin production, bacterial invasion and evasion of host immunity. In conclusion, the present study can provide a reference for clinical pathogen diagnosis of unexplained pneumonia in goats.

AB The development of advanced photothermal materials for personal thermal management is a prominent research focus, specifically aimed at enhancing thermal comfort and optimizing heat exchange between the human body and the environment. This study presents an innovative design strategy for photothermal graphene oxides (GO) films with in-situ incorporated metal ions, showcasing superior light absorption (up to 97.95 % for the GO-Zn-18 film), high photothermal conversion efficiency (reaching similar to 67.2 degrees C under 1 solar illumination), and robust stability, with an adjustable temperature range spanning from 42.6 degrees C to 67.2 degrees C. Numerical analyses and simulations underscore the considerable superiority of the in-situ etching-growth stabilization strategy over conventional film fabrication techniques, allowing for precise temperature adjustment through the control of etching-growth duration. This adaptability facilitates broad applications, which can range from daily personal thermal regulation to high-temperature medical treatments. Moreover, the patterned and large-scale synthesis makes it a promising pathway from laboratory innovation to practical and industrially feasible solutions. The in-situ metal-ion-integrated photothermal GO films thus hold considerable potential in promoting photothermal conversion technologies for highly adaptable personal thermal management solutions.

AB This paper studies the double event-triggered synchronization (ETS) of neutral-type semi-Markovian jump (SMJ) neural networks under synchronous attacks. Firstly, synchronous attacks are modeled by an independent semi-Markovian jump process. Secondly, the double dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (DDETMs) introduced offer the advantage of conserving communication resources and alleviating the computational burden. Thirdly, considering that both the network of sensor to controller and controller to actuator may cause time- varying delays (TVDs), and additive TVDs are designed to enhance the dynamics affected by these delays in the network. Subsequently, a semi-Markov dynamic event-triggered controller is designed to ensure the synchronization of neutral-type SMJ neural networks. Then, the conservatism of the synchronization criterion is reduced by using methods such as asymmetric Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs) and novel reciprocally convex combination inequality (RCCI). Finally, two sets of values are given to prove the effectiveness of the synchronization criterion of the proposed method.

AB The rise of antibiotic-resistant soil microbial communities is a critical global issue. Evidence suggests that heavy metals can select or co-select for tolerance to metals and antibiotics in soil bacteria, but it is unclear if this tolerance varies with land use. We tested the potential of bacterial communities to develop resistance to copper (Cu) or tetracycline (Tet) after amending soils from pristine forests, contaminated forests, and agricultural lands with 3000 mg kg-1 Cu and 6000 mg kg-1 tetracycline, separately. Results showed that bacterial communities of unamended contaminated forest soils had the highest initial tolerance to Cu, while unamended agricultural soils exhibited the highest initial tolerance to tetracycline. The inducibility of bacterial resistance to antibiotics after Cu amendment varied by land use. In pristine forests, Cu amendment significantly increased microbial tetracycline resistance, as indicated by bacterial community tolerance, likely due to higher biodiversity. In contaminated forests, Cu amendment did not induce tetracycline-resistance, as indicated by unchanged bacterial community tolerance, possibly because of existing metal pollution and compromised bacterial communities by metal pollution. In agricultural soils, microbial tetracycline resistance as indicated by bacterial community tolerance developed slowly, becoming evident only after 42 days. These findings reveal significant differences in environmental risks related to soil metal pollution across different land uses, highlighting the need for systematic studies on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in metal-contaminated soils due to their human health implications.

AB Menaquinone-7 (MK-7), known for its health benefits, is in high demand across the health and medical fields. Two-stage fermentation strategy can efficiently enhance MK-7 production by Bacillus subtilis natto (B. subtilis natto). However, B. subtilis natto at different growth phases exhibited significant differences in biofilm formation and MK-7 production during the two-stage fermentation, hindering the efficient and stable synthesis of MK-7. Specifically, 0.72 and 0.25 of biofilm biomass values for cells at the early exponential and stationary phases yield MK-7 concentrations of 55.90 and 12.67 mg/L, respectively, with significant variations in the expression levels of quorum sensing, MK-7 synthesis, and biofilm-related genes detected by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, based on experimental procedures involving fermentation supernatant intervention, nutrient supply, and medium renewal, it was found that the deficiency of essential nutrients, particularly low-molecular-weight (< 1 kDa) fractions of soy protein hydrolysate (SPH), was identified as the primary factor of these differences. Additionally, the influence of cell-secreted metabolites, including the downregulation of surfactin and bacilysin expression by 0.61-fold and 0.33-fold, respectively, further exacerbated these effects. Moreover, the increased proportion of depolarized cells and spores, along with reduced intracellular potassium levels in stationary phase cells, was a secondary effect resulting from the two primary causes. Supplementing with ultrafiltration and 75 % ethanolprecipitated fractions of SPH could restore the MK-7 production by 2.35 and 2.05-fold, and biofilm biomass by 2.43 and 2.11-fold, respectively, in B. subtilis natto at the stationary phase. These findings offer a new perspective on the factors influencing biofilm formation and MK-7 production in B. subtilis natto.

AB The kinetic theory of rarefied gas and optimal control are utilized to investigate the impact of leadership on investment consensus, where leaders belong to investment decision participants and directly participate in the decision-making process. The innovation of this article lies in the establishment of an investment decision model that takes into account both the influence of risk tolerance and leaders' strategy on decision-making. Based on the behavioral characteristics of decision-makers, we divide investment decision participants into leaders and followers. In each interaction, followers are influenced by other followers and leaders, while the influence on leaders comes from other leaders and the optimal decision. By adding a control item to describe the behavior of leaders who require the team to establish consensus, and through model predictive control, a specific expression of the control item is obtained. In addition, we set up the Boltzmann equation to describe the changes in agent density and discuss its main properties. The Fokker-Planck equations corresponding to the Boltzmann equations are derived by using the asymptotic method. Finally, the direct simulation of Monte Carlo method is applied to simulate the evolution of decisions. The results indicate that the risk tolerance and the control of leaders are beneficial for the consistency of collective decision-making.

TI LIPG-mediated regulation of lipid deposition and proliferation in goat
   intramuscular preadipocytes involves the PPARα signaling pathway
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDOTHELIAL LIPASE; FAT DEPOSITION; GENE; EXPRESSION; ADIPOCYTES
AB Endothelial lipase (LIPG), a member of the triglyceride lipase family, plays an essential role in human diseases and lipid metabolism. However, its function in goat intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of the LIPG gene in IMF deposition by knocking down and overexpressing it in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. We successfully cloned the full-length LIPG gene, which spans 2,131bp, including a 94bp 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a 1,503bp coding sequence (CDS), and a 534bp 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Tissue expression profiles showed that LIPG is expressed in the heart, liver, spleen, Kidney, longest dorsal muscle, and small intestine tissues of goats. LIPG knockdown significantly inhibited both the proliferation of intramuscular preadipocytes and lipid deposition. Moreover, LIPG knockdown markedly decreased mRNA expression of FASN, LPL, CPT1A, CPT1B, FABP3, while increasing the mRNA expression of ATGL, ACOX1, FADS1, and ELOVL6. These findings were further corroborated through LIPG overexpression experiments. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identified 1695 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the negative control (NC) and LIPG knockdown (Si-LIPG) groups, with KEGG pathway analysis revealing significant enrichment in the PPAR signaling pathway. Additionally, LIPG knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of both mRNA and protein levels of PPAR alpha. The PPAR alpha agonist WY14643 was able to reverse the enhanced lipid deposition induced by LIPG overexpression. In conclusion, our study highlights a key role for LIPG in the regulation of goat intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and lipid deposition, potentially through the PPAR alpha signaling pathway. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing IMF deposition and suggest potential strategies for improving goat meat quality.

AB The relationship between the multifractal of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its parameters still needs to be discovered. So, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of repetition time (TR) on rs-fMRI signals, and the relationship between multifractal and session. Our findings revealed that the larger the TR, the more scattered the analysis results of multifractal, and the multifractal increase with the TR between Youths and Adults except for the degree of multifractal. However, it is worth noting that when TR = 1.4 s, the average degree of multifractal is generally greater than TR = 0.645 s and TR = 2.5 s. Furthermore, the reliability decreases with the increase in session numbers, increases with rs-fMRI data length increase, and is higher for the short intervals than long ones. Besides, with the rise in the number of sessions, when the data length is >= 400, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.5 of the Hurst exponent (HE); when the data length is equal to 808, the ICC > 0.4 of the maximum gradient, and the spectrum width of ICC < 0.3. With the increase of the session interval, when the data length is >= 200, the ICC > 0.4 of the HE; when the rs-fMRI data length is equal to 808, the ICC approximate to 0.4 of the maximum gradient, and the spectrum width and degree of multifractal of ICC < 0.3. The results are of great significance for understanding the relationship between nonlinear dynamic characteristics and parameters of rs-fMRI.

AB Outlier detection is a pivotal technique within the realm of data mining, serving to pinpoint aberrant values nestled within datasets. It has been widely employed across diverse domains, including detection of credit card frauds, identification of seismic activities, and identification of anomalies within image datasets. However, existing approaches still face three shortcomings: (1) they often struggle with the intricacies of parameter selection and the vexing top-n dilemma, (2) they lack in their capacity to discern local outliers, and (3) their algorithmic efficacies markedly wane as datasets burgeon in sample point size and outlier prevalence. In addressing these formidable hurdles, we propose a novel, Escape Velocity-based adaptive Outlier Detection algorithm, noted as EVOD. The EVOD algorithm calculates the escape velocity of each data sample point and automatically detects the number of outliers by monitoring peak fluctuations in the growth rate of escape velocities of sample points, thereby solving the top-n problem suffered by existing outlier detection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm, without requiring manual adjustment of parameters, can simultaneously detect global outliers, local outliers, and outlier clusters. In addition, it maintains a good performance even as the number of sample points and outliers in the dataset increases, particularly for complex manifold datasets.

AB Accurate segmentation of skin lesions is crucial for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated techniques for skin lesion segmentation assist dermatologists in early detection and ongoing monitoring of various skin diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. To address limitations in existing approaches, we introduce a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture based on our Residual Space State Block. This efficient model, termed 'SSR-UNet,' leverages bidirectional scanning to capture both global and local features in image data, achieving strong performance with low computational complexity. Traditional CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while Transformers, though excellent at global feature extraction, are computationally intensive and require large amounts of data. Our SSR-UNet model overcomes these challenges by efficiently balancing computational load and feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a spatially-constrained loss function that mitigates gradient stability issues by considering the distance between label and prediction boundaries. We rigorously evaluated SSR-UNet on the ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 skin lesion segmentation benchmarks. The results showed that the accuracy of Mean Intersection Over Union, Classification Accuracy and Specificity indexes in ISIC2017 datasets reached 80.98, 96.50 and 98.04, respectively, exceeding the best indexes of other models by 0.83, 0.99 and 0.38, respectively. The accuracy of Mean Intersection Over Union, Dice Coefficient, Classification Accuracy and Sensitivity on ISIC2018 datasets reached 82.17, 90.21, 95.34 and 88.49, respectively, exceeding the best indicators of other models by 1.71, 0.27, 0.65 and 0.04, respectively. It can be seen that SSR-UNet model has excellent performance in most aspects.

AB Introduction Migratory birds exhibit unique annual cycles that complicate their gut microbiota. However, the annual dynamics of gut microbiota in migratory birds remain unclear, hindering our understanding of their environmental adaptation. Methods Here, we collected fecal samples from black-necked cranes (Grus nigricollis) across four seasons at their breeding grounds and used wintering ground data from databases to characterize their gut microbial compositions throughout the year. Results and discussion The results showed that the gut microbiota was clustered by season (Bray-Curtis: R-2 = 0.348, p < 0.001; UniFrac: R-2 = 0.352, p < 0.001). And the summer samples exhibited higher alpha (Simpson and Shannon), beta diversity (Bray-Curtis and UniFrac) and more diverse functions in gut microbiota compared to other seasons. Furthermore, in summer, the gut microbiota exhibited several balanced relative abundances at the family level, whereas Lactobacillaceae family dominated during the other seasons. Thirty-six ASVs were identified by random forest analysis to distinguish samples from distinct seasons. Despite having greater diversity, the summer gut microbiota had a simpler network structure than the other seasons (fewer edges and nodes). The dispersal limitation during random processes also significantly influenced gut microbial community assembly. Overall, the gut microbiota of the black-necked crane undergoes dynamic adjustments to adapt to seasonal environmental changes, which may be associated with the variations in diet across seasons. These results enhance our understanding of the gut microbiota of wild migratory birds and support further research on black-necked cranes.

AB The spouse, parent-child, and sibling subsystems are critical components in the dynamics of multi-child families, collectively contributing to family differentiation and cohesion. This study employs a person-centered approach to explore the interdependence among these subsystems in Chinese multi-child families in Shandong Province. Additionally, it examines the relationships between subsystem patterns and two key outcomes: parental burnout and adolescent loneliness. Data were collected through a survey of 547 adolescent-parent pairs, all from intact, first-marriage, multi-child families. Using latent profile analysis based on marital, parent-child, and sibling relationships, the study identified three distinct profiles within multi-child families: Harmonious (73.1%), Disharmonious-Spillover (20.3%), and Disharmonious-Compensatory (6.6%). Results indicate that Harmonious families are associated with the lowest levels of parental burnout and adolescent loneliness. Conversely, Disharmonious-Spillover families exhibit the highest levels of adolescent loneliness, while Disharmonious-Compensatory families experience the highest levels of parental burnout.

AB Follicular fluid exosomes (FFEs) play a crucial role in follicular growth and maturation. As the fundamental component of the ovarian follicle, granulosa cells (GCs) are instrumental in the development of follicles and oocytes. This study explored the effects of FFEs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and antioxidant activity of yak GCs. An in vitro oxidative stress damage model was established by treating GCs treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and tested their response to exosomes. The results showed that exosomes pretreatment markedly inhibited the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and GSH, and up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant stressrelated genes, including SOD2, NFE2L2, GPX4, and CAT. In addition, exosome pretreatment increased the mRNA and protein levels of proliferation-related genes, PCNA, CDK4, CCND1, and CCNB1, and down-regulated the apoptosis-related genes, BAX, CASP3, and CASP8, in GCs. Our findings support the hypothesis that exosomes derived from follicular fluid can notably reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis in yak GCs. This study provides basic data for elucidating the molecular mechanism of exosomes action, proposes a novel avenue for regulating follicular development and atresia, and paves the way for future research into ways to improve yak breeding.

AB Sensitive and direct detection of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in undiluted human serums can significantly facilitate the diagnosis of different diseases in the early stages; however, the achievement of such a goal is highly challenged by the extremely complex sample matrix nature of serums. Here, we show that sensitive and rapid detection of the circulating let-7a miRNA biomarker in undiluted cancer patient serums can be realized by a new size-permeable microcapsule bioreactor. The Cas13a/crRNA-dsDNA@polyethylene glycol core/shell biomicrocapsules are synthesized by simple encapsulation and etching steps. Such biomicrocapsules exhibit high stability, enhanced protein antifouling capability, and size-selective permeability that only allows short miRNA sequences to enter the core cavities, thereby enabling highly sensitive and direct detection of let-7a miRNA in undiluted serums down to 0.21 pM within 20 min via signal amplification by Cas13a/crRNA and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence signals. The biomicrocapsule also allows unambiguous discrimination of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients from the healthy groups via direct detection of let-7a miRNA in the serum samples, thereby highlighting its robust clinical potential for early disease diagnoses.

AB Lysine-specific histone demethylase 2 (Kdm2a) is essential for histone modifications involved in development and associated diseases. Nevertheless, the specific functions of Kdm2a in renal development and pathology remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the roles of Kdm2a in sustaining the biological functions of the kidney by generating mutant mice with Kdm2a deletion using the Aqp2-cre/Loxp system. Our findings showed that Kdm2a is widely expressed across various mouse tissues, with particularly high expression in the kidney's cortex and medulla, surpassing that in other tissues. Despite no observable effects on morphology or survival following the conditional knockout of Kdm2a, there was a significant reduction in body weight and bilateral kidney weight compared to controls, most pronounced at the 5-week-old stage (p < 0.05). Post Kdm2a deletion, kidney metabolic functions were impaired, evidenced by altered levels of creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein. Histological examination revealed that Kdm2a-null kidneys exhibited signs of dysfunction, characterized by macrophage infiltration, fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mild thrombosis. Further studies revealed that the expression of chemokine- and pro-inflammatory cytokine-related genes Il-6, Il-8, Tnf-a, and Il-1 beta was significantly increased in the kidneys of Kdm2a cKO mice compared with controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of reabsorption-related genes (Aqp-3, Aqp-5, and Aqp-8) was markedly downregulated in Kdm2a-deficient kidneys compared with controls (p < 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that Kdm2a is crucial for maintaining kidney function and development, partly through the suppression of inflammation and regulation of gene expression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Kdm2a in kidney development warrant further investigation.

AB As society develops, the aging population issue is becoming more serious and gaining global attention. Meanwhile, the building industry worldwide is focusing on making buildings more convenient for the elderly. This study focuses on a health care building, analyzing its aging-friendly design. It examines issues related to walking situations and activity spaces and proposes optimization strategies based on relevant codes and actual needs. Through optimization and transformation, the walking distance to the nearest exit for the elderly in the building has been reduced by 36.8%, the walking distance to activity space for the elderly has been reduced by 8.4%, and the average public activity space of each elderly person has been increased by about 23.5%. In addition, the handrails of the accessible stairway have been changed to double handrails, which is more suitable for the different needs of the elderly, and the space of the wheelchair-accessible elevator has been expanded, which is more convenient for the elderly's activities in elevators. This paper explores the feasibility and design direction of the aging-friendly architecture, and it aims to provide a valuable reference for the renovation of aging buildings.

AB Compared with research on the rapid development of Chinese metropolitan regions, systematic studies on nature conservation in metropolitan regions are lacking. We still lack a deep understanding of the spatial relationship between natural protected areas and built-up areas in Chinese metropolitan regions. In this study, we selected four time points, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2019, to analyze the evolution of the spatial patterns of natural protected areas and built-up areas in metropolitan regions with a population exceeding one million in China, and to analyze their coexistence status. A comprehensive indicator "Index of coexistence degree" (ICD) was established to evaluate the spatial coexistence relationship between natural protected areas and built-up areas, objectively quantifying this coexistence phenomenon. The study found that over the past 30 years, the coexistence of natural protected areas and built-up areas in China's metropolitan regions has increased significantly: The number of natural protected areas in metropolitan regions has increased by 36 times, the area has increased by 12 times, the nearest distance between natural protected areas and built-up areas has decreased from 15 km to 0.7 km; The ICD value has increased from 0.012 in 1990 to 0.037 in 2019, and the number of cities with high ICD values increased from 1 to 32. Metropolitan regions in China should emphasize the development of natural protected areas in future, spatial pattern for better coexistence with nature is important for biodiversity and human well-being.

AB BackgroundMicrosatellites are highly polymorphic repeat sequences ubiquitously interspersed throughout almost all genomes which are widely used as powerful molecular markers in diverse fields. Microsatellite expansions play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and are implicated in various neurological diseases and cancers. Although much effort has been devoted to developing efficient tools for microsatellite identification, there is still a lack of a powerful tool for large-scale microsatellite analysis.ResultsWe present Krait2, a user-friendly graphical tool for investigating perfect, imperfect and compound microsatellites from FASTA and FASTQ formatted genomic datasets. Krait2 not only provides features such as primer design, repeat filtering, repeat annotation and statistical analysis, but also offers various output formats to support customized downstream analysis. Moreover, it has capability of analyzing multiple genomes simultaneously and conducting comparative analysis.ConclusionsKrait2 is a versatile and easy-to-use software for both novices and experts to identify and analyze microsatellites.

AB To elucidate how hosts adapt to changing environments with the assistance of symbiotic microorganisms, we must first understand host-microbe interactions. However, the covariation patterns of gut microbiota and hosts under complex natural conditions are poorly understood. To address this gap in our knowledge, we used metabarcoding of plant RbcL and animal COI regions, along with bacterial 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses. This enabled the analysis of the interactions between the gut microbiota of the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis), a large migratory bird, and its plant and animal diets to be analyzed. The impact of these interactions on the adaptive strategies of the black-necked crane during different periods in the Zoige wetland, China, was also assessed. We found that the black-necked crane harbored more gut bacterial communities and more diverse plant-derived foods during the post-breeding period than during the pre-breeding period. The gut microbiota and diet covaried throughout the breeding season and exhibited seasonal patterns. Araneae and Cyperaceae were correlated with pre-breeding bacterial profile, whereas Acrididae and Elaeagnaceae were associated with post-breeding bacterial abundance. Sample microbiota distance (between-sample diversity) increased with increasing animal and plant diet distance, and this relationship was enhanced between the plant diet and gut microbiome, with a greater value observed during the pre-breeding period than during the post-breeding period. According to Simpson's indexes, the gut microbiota was also positively associated with the plant-based diet across the seasons. The plant diet-microbe co- occurrence network was more complex than the animal diet-microbe network. The gut micro- biota functional profile revealed that several amino acids, folate, lipids, and metabolic pathways were more abundant during the pre-breeding period, which enriched the nutrient resources of the black-necked crane prior to breeding. In contrast, carbohydrate metabolism was more abundant during the post-breeding period, which helped the black-necked crane to accumulate energy for its upcoming migration. These results suggest flexible host-microbiome-host relationships in two seasons and that host physiological needs interact with foraging strategies to shape the micro- biome, ultimately resulting in host adaptations to seasonal shifts. These results provide insights into the role of the gut microbiota in host adaptations to seasonal changes under natural conditions.

AB Exploring the toxicity and metabolic mechanisms of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in ruminants can help to develop strategies to prevent or reduce the transfer of the toxin and its metabolites to milk and meat. This study aimed to explore the effects of 3 concentrations of dietary AFB1 (0, 50, and 500 mu g/kg) on hepatic injury and metabolism in Saanen goats via histological examination, western blot analysis, as well as integrated multiomics techniques. Eighteen Saanen goats were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments and the AFB1 challenge lasted for 14 d. Results showed that the liver tissue was enlarged and the relative organ index of the liver was linearly increased with elevated AFB1 levels. The hepatocyte apoptosis rate was significantly increased after AFB1 exposure, and the western blotting results revealed that both the external apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway might be involved in AFB1-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. We identified 251, 269, and 154 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 340, 596, and 127 significant differential metabolites in comparisons between the control (CON; 0 mu g/kg) and low-dose (LO; 50 mu g/kg) groups, the CON and high-dose (HI; 500 mu g/ kg) groups, and the LO and HI groups, respectively. The DEG annotated were mainly involved in the cell part, cell, single-organism process, cellular process, binding, and other functional categories. The identified metabolites primarily belonged to glycerophospholipids, prenol lipids, carboxylic acids, and derivatives. Integrative analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed that glycerophospholipids metabolism and choline metabolism in cancer were the most affected pathways related to AFB1 exposure. The identified differential metabolites, DEG, and pathways might have played a crucial role in the hepatic injury induced by AFB1 in goats.

AB Artificial defects in energetic materials can alter their hotspot formation and decomposition processes. In this paper, we set up the RDX model embedded with carbon nanotube (CNT) and investigate the process of the hot spot formation and propagation in the CNT-embedded RDX composite under the applied external electric field using ReaxFF molecular dynamics. The early inter-molecular reactions were also analyzed. Results show that the hot spot is formed around CNT due to the conversion of strain energy of the embedded CNT in the applied electric field. And as the hot spot grows, a combustion layer is generated. During the propagation of the hot spot, the speed of combustion front increases with the time. By analyzing the types and quantities of the main intermediate products during the early decomposition reaction, we found that the presence of an electric field promotes inter-molecular decomposition reactions of CNT-embedded RDX composite.

AB We introduce a novel quartic Camassa-Holm type equation and address their traveling wave solutions. The difficulties related to the non-analytical vector fields and complex elliptic integrals are overcome by using the theory of singular traveling wave systems. Upon analyzing the bifurcations of the traveling wave solutions, we study the phase portraits of different topologies, and obtain some exact traveling wave solutions including peakons, periodic peakons, solitary waves, and kink wave solutions. Our results are useful to better understand wave phenomena described by partial differential equations with higher-order nonlinear terms, and pave the way to obtain the traveling wave solutions of other equations with similar nonlinear terms.

AB The development of top-tier agricultural product bases and demonstration zones aims to propel Chinese agriculture into the global market, form international competitiveness, and advance to the high end of the global industrial and value chain. This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating the performance and factors influencing the competitiveness of Chinese agricultural product exports at the provincial level, using a complex network perspective, and offers recommendations for improvement. In this regard, the article uses agricultural product export data from 2015 to 2022 to create export competitiveness networks of Chinese provincial agricultural products. Our analysis revealed four primary observations. Firstly, significant opportunities exist to improve the competitive edge of agricultural product exports across various Chinese provinces. Secondly, with the exception of Guangdong Province, the types of competitively robust agricultural products exported by each province are inconsistent. Thirdly, international sister-city relationships can foster the development of an export competitiveness network of Chinese provincial agricultural products, while geographic distance may hinder this network. These findings are consistent. Lastly, the development of this competition-focused export network is also influenced by province-level and national characteristics, and these influences have unique differences. All provinces should strive to produce distinctive and globally competitive agricultural goods to build their competitive advantage in international trade. They should also implement strategic regional planning to support the global expansion of their agricultural products.

AB Introduction: Sleep deprivation (SD) significantly disrupts the homeostasis of the cardiac-brain axis, yet the neuromodulation effects of deep magnetic stimulation (DMS), a non-invasive and safe method, remain poorly understood. Methods: Sixty healthy adult males were recruited for a 36-h SD study, they were assigned to the DMS group or the control group according to their individual willing. All individuals underwent heart sound measurements and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at the experiment's onset and terminal points. During the recovery sleep phase, DMS was applied twice for 30 min before sleep onset and upon awakening to the individuals in the DMS group. Two-factor analysis was used to disclose the changes in two status and intervention effect in groups, along with Spearman rank correlation analysis to assess the correlation between brain activity and heart activity, the linear regression analysis was performed to explore the effect of DMS on brain regions to regulated the heart activity. Additionally, bootstrapping analysis was employed to verify the mediation effect. Results: The results indicated that the DMS group cardiac cycle duration was 0.81 +/- 0.04 s, CON group was 0.80 +/- 0.03 s, DMS presented a prolong effect (F = 0.32, p = 0.02), and all heart frequency and intensity indexes value were lower than CON group (p < 0.01). Two-factor analysis demonstrated the significant differences in the left insula and orbitofrontal inferior gyrus, which DC_Weight (0.25) value were lower 0.50 (p < 0.01), 0.42 (p < 0.01) after DMS. Furthermore, the correlation analysis confirmed that the negative association between the left orbital inferior frontal and left insula with the heart sound index (p < 0.05), such as Delta left orbital inferior frontal were negatively correlated with Delta Systolic_intensity (rho = -0.33, p < 0.05), Delta Diastolic_intensity (rho = -0.41, p < 0.05), Delta S1_intensity (rho = -0.36, p < 0.05), and Delta S2_intensity (rho = -0.43, p < 0.05). Delta Left insula was negatively correlated with Delta Diastolic_intensity (rho = -0.36, p < 0.05), Delta S1_intensity (rho = -0.33, p < 0.05), and Delta S2_intensity (rho = -0.36, p < 0.05). Mediated effect analysis showed that DMS affected S2_intensity by intervening in brain regions. Conclusion: These findings suggest a causal effect on the cardiac-brain axis following 36 h of SD. The non-invasive intervention of DMS effectively regulates both brain and heart functions after SD, promoting homeostatic balance. The DMS can affect the cardiac-brain axis, offering a means to restore balance following extended periods of SD.

AB It is one of the strategies to study the complexity of spontaneous fluctuation of brain neurons based on resting- state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), but the multifractal characteristics of spontaneous fluctuation of brain neurons in psychiatric diseases need to be studied. Therefore, this paper will study the multifractal spontaneous brain activity changes in psychiatric disorders using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis algorithm based on the UCLA datasets. Specifically: (1) multifractal characteristics in adult attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SCHZ); (2) the source of those multifractal characteristics. Results showed that for adult ADHD, BP, and SCHZ, all 6 functional brain regions exhibit multifractal characteristics, and the multifractal spectrum shows a reduction in bell-shaped asymmetry, unlike the intensity of healthy control (HC) asymmetry. Besides, compared with HC, the multifractal sources of all functional brain regions were fat-tail probability distribution and the long-range dependence correlation, but the intensity of fat-tail probability distribution was decreased and the long-range dependence correlation was increased. The results provide a reference for further understanding the complexity of spontaneous fluctuation of neurons in psychiatric disorders.

AB Background: Polygonum multiflorum (PM), known as a traditional Chinese herb renowned for its tonic properties, has been used medicinally for millennia. However, it has drawn attention significantly due to the potential to induce idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) in recent years. Previous studies identified the TNF-alpha, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, as a key factor contributing to susceptibility to PM induced-IDILI (PM-IDILI). However, the effects by which TNF-alpha mediates PM-IDILI remain poorly understood. Methods: This study sought to elucidate the role of TNF-alpha in PM-IDILI using a TNF-alpha-sensitized C57BL/6J mouse model, integrating analyses of the gut microbiota and metabolomics We employed biochemical analysis, inflammatory markers, inflammatory liver histopathological, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, as well as untargeted metabolomics based on LC-MS to systematically evaluate the extent of liver injury and characterize alterations in gut microbiota and liver metabolites following PM administration in TNF-alpha pre-treated mice. Results: The results demonstrated that PM treatment in TNF-alpha-sensitized mice significantly elevated levels of indicators as AST (3.6-fold compared to the control group, P < 0.05) and ALT (3.9-fold compared to the control group, P < 0.01), increased plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-1 beta (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), induced infiltration of inflammatory cell substantially in the liver. TNF-alpha-mediated PM disrupted the intestinal microbiota structure, characterized by reduced abundance of Akkermansia and increased abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Blautia. Furthermore, hepatic metabolomics analysis revealed that significant perturbations in TNF-alpha + PM treated mice, particularly affecting glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways. Conclusion: These findings suggest that TNF-alpha sensitization predisposes mice to PM-IDILI, potentially by disrupting gut microbial homeostasis and altering host hepatic metabolism. This research provides critical theoretical and experimental evidence relevant to the safe and effective clinical application of PM.

AB Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is an important pathological state in the progression of chronic liver disease to end-stage liver disease and is usually triggered by alcohol, nonalcoholic fatty liver, chronic hepatitis viruses, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), or cholestatic liver disease. Research on novel therapies has become a hot topic due to the reversibility of HF. Research into the molecular mechanisms of the pathology of HF and potential drug screening relies on reliable and rational biological models, mainly including animals and cells. Hence, a number of modeling approaches have been attempted based on human dietary, pathological, and physiological factors in the development of HF. In this review, classical and novel methods of modeling HF in the last 10 years were collected from electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Baidu Scholar, and CNKI. Animal models of HF are usually induced by chemical toxicants, special diets, pathogenic microorganisms, surgical operations, and gene editing. The advantages and limitations of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), organoids, and 3D coculture-based HF modeling methods established in vitro were also proposed and summarized. This information provides a scientific basis for the discovery of the pathological mechanism and treatment of HF.

AB This study explored the mediating effect of coping styles in the relationship between psychological capital and learning burnout. We used a cluster sampling method to recruit 647 college students, who completed the Psychological Capital Scale, the Learning Burnout Scale, and the Chinese Trait Coping Style Questionnaire. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the role of positive coping and negative coping, and a bootstrapping analysis was used to verify the mediation effect. The results showed that there were negative correlations between learning burnout and psychological capital, and between positive coping and learning burnout, and that there was a positive correlation between negative coping and learning burnout. In sum, positive coping and negative coping were partial mediators of the relationship between psychological capital and learning burnout. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Purpose: Prolonged exposure of the skin to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight causes oxidative damage to skin cells, and prolonged exposure to UV can lead to severe sunburn and skin aging, which may increase the risk of skin cancer. Numerous natural products have been used to treat UV-induced skin damage. Baicalin (BA) has excellent antioxidant properties; however, its poor solubility hinders its direct application. Therefore, suitable formulations for dermal administration must be developed. Methods: We designed a temperature-sensitive gel drug delivery system based on baicalin liposome (BA-LP), which was first constructed using lecithin loaded with insoluble BA. Subsequently, an injectable hydrogel (BA-LG) with temperature-sensitive properties was constructed using BA-LP and chitosan (CS) with (3-glycerophosphate tetrahydrate ((3-GP) as a crosslinking agent. Results: BA-LP had homogeneous particle size, high EE, and good stability. BA-LG could be gelled within 2 min at 37 degrees C and had good spreading, adhesion, and injectability properties. The in vitro release results showed that BA-LG had a significantly slower release effect, with a cumulative release of 60% at 24 h. The effects of BA-LG on skin keratinocyte HaCaT cells were evaluated using the CCK8 method and transwell co-culture, and the results showed good cell activity and a high survival rate, indicating that the hydrogel has good biosafety. In the UVB-induced skin injury mouse model, BA-LG showed significant effects by increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) damage, and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors IL-6, PGE2, and TNF-alpha, and demonstrated a superior therapeutic effect. The analysis of histopathological sections of the skin stained with H&E and Masson revealed results consistent with those observed on the mice. Conclusion: In summary, our results suggest that BA-LG, a temperature-sensitive gel based on baicalin liposomes, has good therapeutic efficacy and potential applications in the treatment of UVB-induced skin damage.

AB In remote sensing image processing for Earth and environmental applications, super-resolution (SR) is a crucial technique for enhancing the resolution of low-resolution (LR) images. In this study, we proposed a novel algorithm of frequency-domain super-resolution with reconstruction from compressed representation. The algorithm follows a multistep procedure: first, an LR image in the space domain is transformed to the frequency domain using a Fourier transform. The frequency-domain representation is then expanded to the desired size (number of pixels) of a high-resolution (HR) image. This expanded frequency-domain image is subsequently inverse Fourier transformed back to the spatial domain, yielding an initial HR image. A final HR image is then reconstructed from the initial HR image using a low-rank regularization model that incorporates a nonlocal smoothed rank function (SRF). We evaluated the performance of the new algorithm by comparing the reconstructed HR images with those generated by several commonly used SR algorithms, including: 1) bicubic interpolation; 2) sparse representation; 3) adaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization; 4) fuzzy-rule-based (FRB) algorithm; 5) SR convolutional neural networks (SRCNNs); 6) fast SR convolutional neural networks (FSRCNNs); 7) practical degradation model for deep blind image SR; 8) the frequency separation for real-world SR (FSSR); and 9) the enhanced SR generative adversarial networks (ESRGANs). The algorithms were tested on Landsat-8 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multiresolution images over various locations, as well as on images with artificially added noise to assess the robustness of each algorithm. Results show that: 1) the proposed new algorithm outperforms the others in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structure similarity, and root-mean-square error and 2) it effectively suppresses noise during HR reconstruction from noisy low-resolution (LR) images, overcoming a key limitation of existing SR methods.

AB We consider a class of L1-regularized optimization problems and the associated smooth ``overparameterized"" optimization problems built upon the Hadamard parametrization, or equivalently, the Hadamard difference parametrization (HDP). We characterize the set of secondorder stationary points of the HDP-based model and show that they correspond to some stationary points of the corresponding L1-regularized model. More importantly, we show that the Kurdyka-\Lojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the HDP-based model at a second-order stationary point can be inferred from that of the corresponding L1-regularized model under suitable assumptions. Our assumptions are general enough to cover a wide variety of loss functions commonly used in L1-regularized models, such as the least squares loss function and the logistic loss function. Since the KL exponents of many L1-regularized models are explicitly known in the literature, our results allow us to leverage these known exponents to deduce the KL exponents at second-order stationary points of the corresponding HDP-based models, which were previously unknown. Finally, we demonstrate how these explicit KL exponents at second-order stationary points can be applied to deducing the explicit local convergence rate of a standard gradient descent method for minimizing the HDP-based model.

AB This letter addresses the issue of cooperative vehicle tracking in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) through the fusion of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and time-of-arrival (TOA) based ranging information. We propose a novel distributed improved Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) to enhance the state estimation accuracy of all vehicles. This approach comprises two parts: local improved CKF processing and cooperative fusion tracking. Due to the nonlinearity of the ranging measurement function with respect to both local vehicle state and neighboring vehicle state, an augmented parameter vector is constructed in the improved CKF method to tackle this challenge. Then, we present the optimal cooperative fusion of the local vehicle state estimate and the estimates from its neighbors, in the sense of minimizing the fused mean squared error. Numerical examples demonstrate that the root of average mean squared error (RAMSE) of the proposed method can be significantly reduced.

AB Canine distemper (CD) is a highly infectious disease of dogs which is caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). Previous studies have demonstrated that CDV infection can induce autophagy in cells. However, the mechanism underlying CDV-induced autophagy remains not fully understood. The CDV non-structural protein V plays a vital role in viral replication and pathogenicity in the host. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the CDV-V protein and autophagy induction and further explored its impact on the viral replication and the mechanism behind this. Our results showed that the V protein induced autophagy via inhibiting the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR to promote viral replication. The activation or inhibition of PI3K phosphorylation resulted in enhancing or reducing viral replication, respectively. Further studies revealed that the V protein interacted with PI3K to induce cellular autophagy. The present study demonstrated that the CDV-V protein can induce cellular autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to enhance viral replication. The results improve the understanding of the molecular mechanism of CDV infection and offer new perspectives for the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies.

AB Methionine is an amino acid necessary for the growth and development of all animals. Glutathione produced during methionine metabolism can reduce damage to cells caused by oxidative stress. Supplementing restricted amino acids in animals by scientific means will be beneficial to protein synthesis, which will affect the growth and development of animals and will bring huge economic benefits when applied to actual production and life. In this study, we collected three muscle tissues from 24 male Maiwa yaks, which were fattened for three months with different methionine concentrations in their diet. RNA-seq was performed to obtain expression reads. A total of 1116 editing sites were identified by at least two software; the editing site types were mainly T-to-C and A-to-G mutations. We found two significant RNA editing sites presenting high-risk editing types. One was located on the MSRA gene that regulates the reduction of methionine, and the other can make changes to the properties of encoded proteins. This provides further understanding of the mechanism of yak muscle tissue and regulation of gene expression after the addition of methionine to daily rations.

TI Transfer learning of neural operators for partial differential equations
   based on sparse network λ-FNO
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK
AB When the solution domain, internal parameters, and initial and boundary conditions of partial differential equation (PDE) are changed, many potential characteristics of the equation's solutions are still similar. This provides the possibility to reduce the cost of PDE operator learning through transfer learning methods. Based on Fourier neural operator (FNO), we propose a novel sparse neural operator network named lambda-FNO. By introducing the lambda parameter matrix and using a new pruning method to make the network sparse, the operator learning ability of lambda-FNO is greatly improved. Using lambda-FNO can efficiently learn the operator from the discrete initial function space on the uniform grid to the discrete equation's solution space on the unstructured grid, which is not available in FNO. Finally, we apply lambda-FNO to several specific transfer tasks of partial differential equations under conditional distributions to demonstrate its excellent transferability. The experimental results show that when the shape of the solution domain of the equation or its internal parameters change, our framework can capture the potential invariant information of its solution and complete related transfer learning tasks with less cost, higher accuracy, and faster speed. In addition, the sparse framework has excellent extension and can be easily extended to other network architectures to enhance its performance. Our model and data generation code can get through https://github.com/Xumouren12/TL-FNO.

AB As technologies such as artificial intelligence rapidly evolve, the traditional lecture-based class can no longer meet students' learning needs. Previous research has demonstrated that AI can be essential for improving the learning experience. However, research has also pointed out that promoting AI applications in education has been challenging. Developing domain-specific applications based on AI technology is a massive challenge for the development of AI in education. Further research has pointed out that the development of AI applications in education rarely considers students' perceptual learning motivations. This study proposes a teaching method based on an artificial intelligence tool, the Artificial Intelligence Smart Sketchpad (AISS), to assist in teaching character art design in a multimedia environment. The artificial intelligence will identify students' drawing sketches and make corrections. This study explores the impact of AISS on achievement, engagement, and motivation among film character art design students in a multimedia environment. To this end, we adopted a quantitative research method. Over five weeks, we assessed 60 university students. Research results indicate that the AI smart sketchpad (AISS) significantly improves students' motivation, engagement, and performance. Student feedback suggests that AI stimulates creative thinking by offering greater creative freedom and possibilities and quickly transforming sketches into high-quality design drawings. A new direction will be explored for personalized and self-learning for students.

AB As a kind of typical lead-free piezoelectric ceramics, potassium sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO3, KNN)-based ceramics have attracted wide attention because of excellent piezoelectric performance and high Curie temperature. Although the performance has been significantly optimized by phase structure regulation, the original mechanism is poorly defined. In this work, the effect of phase structures on intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to piezoelectric response are explored via Rayleigh analysis with increasing T phase. With the phase transition from R-O to R-O-T, the extrinsic contribution increases because of promoted domain switching from lowed polarization anisotropy with energy barrier. The enlarged extrinsic contribution as well as lowered intrinsic ones is obtained near O-T phase transition temperature due to promoted domain evolution and increase activity of domain under thermal field. Based on the evolution of contribution, the optimized ferroelectric/piezoelectric performance is always achieved for R-O-T phase boundary with enhanced T phase, originated by the strengthened extrinsic contribution. This work further reveals the origin of high piezoelectric response with multiphase coexistence, facilitating the development of high-performance piezoelectric materials.

AB This article focuses on the dissipative stability issue with load frequency control (LFC) in multiple time-varying delay (MTD) power systems. Firstly, the model is constructed considering the effects of MTD. Next, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKF) are constructed which include delay-product-type terms (DPT) with MTD. Then, the low conservative stability criteria with respect to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived through the application of auxiliary function-based integral inequalities (AFBII) and improved reciprocal convex inequalities (IRCI) to handle the DPT. Next, an effective dissipative control strategy is developed based on the above criteria. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out, and the effectiveness of the proposed design method is highlighted by comparing with the previous results.

AB This study enhances the understanding of virus removal efficiency by filters, crucial for predicting respiratory disease transmission risk and guiding outbreak prevention. Current research often neglects the survival behaviour of pathogens. Addressing this, our research develops a novel approach anchored in medical experimental data. A mathematical model was established to depict the dynamic changes in particulate concentration within non-centralized air-conditioned rooms, considering indoor and outdoor concentrations, natural ventilation, and filter dynamics. The model's reliability was affirmed through particle and aerosolized pathogen filtration experiments, showing an R2 value over 0.99, indicating strong agreement with empirical data. Analysis of filter operation, both with and without infection sources during epidemics, reveals that the use of split air conditioners and filters significantly reduces pathogen concentration. Pathogens trapped in filters undergo natural decay, considerably lowering transmission risk compared to airborne states. This research offers a scientifically grounded, precise methodology for evaluating respiratory disease transmission risks, contributing substantially to public health management.

AB Coronary artery disease represents a formidable health threat to middle-aged and elderly populations worldwide. This research introduces an advanced BP neural network algorithm, EPSOSA-BP, which integrates particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and a particle elimination mechanism to elevate the precision of heart disease prediction models. To address prior limitations in feature selection, the study employs single-hot encoding and Principal Component Analysis, thereby enhancing the model's feature learning capability. The proposed method achieved remarkable accuracy rates of 93.22% and 95.20% on the UCI and Kaggle datasets, respectively, underscoring its exceptional performance even with small sample sizes. Ablation experiments further validated the efficacy of the data preprocessing and feature selection techniques employed. Notably, the EPSOSA algorithm surpassed classical optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed, while also demonstrating improved sensitivity and specificity. This model holds significant potential for facilitating early identification of high-risk patients, which could ultimately save lives and optimize the utilization of medical resources. Despite implementation challenges, including technical integration and data standardization, the algorithm shows promise for use in emergency settings and community health services for regular cardiac risk monitoring.

AB The effect of K+ ions doping on YbVO4: Er3+ was studied under the excitation of a 980 nm laser. The intensity of multiple emission peaks increased was found to be enhanced at 527 nm ( 2 H 11/2 -> 4 I 15/2 ), 553 nm ( 4 S 3/2 -> 4 I 15/2 ), 654 nm ( 4 F 9/2 -> 4 I 15/2 ), and 803 nm ( 4 I 9/2 -> 4 I 15/2 ), including green, red, and near-infrared spectra. The optimal doping concentration was 0.1 K+ ions in YbVO4: 0.02Er3+. The enhancement of upconversion luminescence is attributed to the presence of defect bands, which facilitate the absorption of excited photons and enable effective energy transfer from abundant electrons to Yb3+ ( 2 F 5/2 ) and Er3+ ( 4 I 11/2 ) ions. YbVO4: Er3+/K+ was utilized in a three-mode temperature sensor, employing TCEL modes of 2H11/2/4S3/2, NTCEL modes of 2H11/2/4F9/2 and 4 S 3/ 2/4F9/2, and single luminescence intensity at I 803 . It exhibited maximum relative sensitivities of 1.36 % (298 K), 0.77 % (398 K), 0.44 % (298 K), and 1.69 % (623 K), respectively, highlighting its potential in high-precision optical temperature sensing applications.

AB This paper examines the role of regional attitudes towards gambling on enterprise internationalization performance. Using the unique data of lottery sale as a proxy for local gambling preference, combining the data of Chinese listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2019, we find that firms headquartered in gambling-prone areas are more likely to have better internationalization performance. This result is valid after undertaking a series of robust tests and addressing endogeneity. Furthermore, we identify three channels through which gambling preferences intensify enterprises internationalization performance: spillover effect, market expansion effect and innovation incentives effect. Finally, the incentive effect is more pronounced in firms with more serious financial constraints, worse corporate governance, located in worse economic performance regions and those non-state-owned enterprises. We suggest that regional preferences toward gambling play an important role in enterprises internationalization, and present new insight to improve international market competitiveness for emerging economies.

AB Efficient thermal environment control in large public buildings with atria is critical for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. This study investigates the indoor thermal environments of two distinct atria in Suining, China, within a Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW) climate zone. A novel methodology combining Kmeans clustering algorithms and multiple linear regression (CAMLR) was employed to analyze extensive thermal data from a transitional atrium and a traditional atrium. CAMLR significantly outperformed Traditional Building Thermal environment analysis Methods (TBTM), achieving a 33.8 % higher R2 and reducing the residual sum of squares by 62.11 %. Key findings include: 1) A strong correlation (R2 = 0.9555) between outdoor temperature and indoor thermal conditions in the transitional atrium, highlighting a critical outdoor temperature threshold of 30 degrees C that leads to prolonged indoor heat retention. 2) Solar radiation plays a dominant role in the traditional atrium (R2 = 0.5584), influencing rapid temperature fluctuations. These insights underscore the critical role of atrium design in optimizing thermal performance and energy efficiency. Compared to TBTM, CAMLR provides faster, more accurate, and highly visualized data analysis, making it particularly suitable for complex thermal environment studies. This study establishes CAMLR as a robust tool for advancing thermal management strategies in large public buildings, offering practical guidance for energy-efficient architectural designs in similar climate zones.

AB Introduction: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes reproductive and respiratory diseases in sow herds and piglets. The emergence of ORF5 RFLP 1-7-4-like (NADC34-like) PRRSV strain in China has brought a new round of challenges to PRRSV prevention. Methods: In addition, recombinant adenovirus vaccine candidates against the newly emerged NADC34-like strain were constructed in the study; the immunogenicity of the vaccine was investigated in piglets. After inoculation with PRRSV recombinant adenovirus, specific antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 cytokines were detected in serum. Results: Thirty-five days after immunization, the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 cytokines in the pac-Ad5-34-GP3, pac-Ad5-34-GP5, and pac-Ad5-34-GP35 experimental groups were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the PBS and the adenovirus group. All vaccines can cause corresponding Th1 and Th2 immune responses based on animal experimental results. After the challenge, no obvious clinical symptoms were observed in the immune groups compared with the control group, vaccinated animals could reduce the occurrence of viremia, and the occurrence of viremia was alleviated, with no obvious pathological changes in the lungs, indicating that recombinant adenovirus vaccine could provide a good protective immunity and produce a good humoral and cellular immune response at the same time. Discussion: It shows that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine group has better protection against the virus. Provide vaccine reserve and theoretical support for the emergence of new PRRSV subtypes in China.

AB This paper studies the asynchronous output feedback control and H infinity synchronization problems fora class of continuous-time stochastic hidden semi-Markov jump neural networks (SMJNNs) affected by actuator saturation. Initially, a novel neural networks (NNs) model is constructed, incorporating semi-Markov process (SMP), hidden information, and Brownian motion to accurately simulate the complexity and uncertainty of real-world environments. Secondly, acknowledging system mode mismatches and the need for robust anti- interference capabilities, a non-fragile controller based on hidden information is proposed. The designed controller effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainties enhancing system reliability. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for stochastic mean square synchronization (MSS) within the domain of attraction are provided, and optimal control is achieved through the construction of a Lyapunov function based on SMP. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through numerical examples.

AB Porcine stool-associated RNA virus (Posavirus) is an unclassified virus with sequence similarity to viruses in the order of Picornaviridae. In China, lineage 1 Posavirus (Posavirus 1) has been circulating in the field since its initial emergence in 2014 however no other lineages have been reported. To investigate the genetic diversity of Posavirus in China, 1200 diarrheic samples were collected from pigs in China. Following high-throughput and Sanger sequencing, one complete genome sequence of a Posavirus (designated SC01) strain was obtained. The genome of SC01 strain was 10217 nucleotides in length and encoded a polyprotein of 3346 amino acids. Genome comparative analysis revealed that SC01 shared 85.6% nucleotide similarity to Posavirus 2 strains, but only 35.2-58.0% sequence identity with Posavirus 1 and 3-12 strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SC01 was classified in Posavirus 2 and clustered into a separate branch with the American Posavirus 2 isolates, indicating that the SC01 is a Posavirus 2 strain. Notably, a novel 1-amino acid deletion was observed in polyprotein at amino acid position 147. This is the first report of the presence of Posavirus 2 in China, and the genomic data of SC01 provides insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of Posavirus in the region.

ID CHINA; PRODUCTIVITY; DYNAMICS
AB Climate and land-use change are key factors of vegetation dynamics, and impacts arising from both of them need to be further studied. This study simulated the fraction of vegetation coverage in 2050 through coupling the Patch-Generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and the Dimidiate Pixel model and explored the effects of climate and land-use change on fraction vegetation coverage in the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle region. The findings indicated that: (1) fraction vegetation coverage was mainly restored over the 2000-2020 period, accounting for 59.38% of the investigation area. Under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, fraction vegetation coverage increased by 40.57% and 46.38%, respectively. (2) under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, the superposition effect of climate and land use change on fraction vegetation coverage significantly outweighed the compensation effect. Specifically, the superposition effect of climate and land use change on fraction vegetation cover accounted for 90.69% and 90.57% of the total area, respectively. Conversely, the compensation effect constituted a relatively minor proportion, representing 9.31% and 9.43% of the total area, respectively. (3) the positive superposition effect of climate changes and land use on fraction vegetation coverage was 35.47% and 40.90%, respectively, while the negative superposition effect was 55.22% and 49.67%, respectively. These findings aimed to offer guidance for the execution of vegetation restoration initiatives in the upstream region.

AB Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed in solid tumors and may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in solid cancers. Linagliptin inhibits FAP; however, the interaction mechanism between linagliptin and FAP remains unclear. In this study, the binding free energy for linagliptin with human FAP was estimated at-13.66 kcal/mol, and the dissociation constant was 243 nM based on surface plasmon resonance analyses. E203, E204, and Y656 formed hydrogen bonds with ammonium. Y625 formed an unstable hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group. W623 and Y541 interacted with the quinazoline and pyrimidine-2,4-dione rings, respectively, via p-p interactions. The butyne group formed hydrophobic interactions with residues V650, Y653, Y656, and Y660. ZINC000299754517 and ZINC000299754576 were identified as potential FAP inhibitors. The R1 and R4 regions of linagliptin could be optimized to increase its FAP binding affinity. These findings can guide linagliptin structural optimization to improve its FAP binding affinity.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of short-term exposure of Bisphenol A (BPA) on the growth and lactation performance, blood parameters, and milk composition of lactating rabbits and explore its potential molecular mechanisms. Eight lactating rabbits with similar body weight were selected and randomly divided into the experimental group (BPA) and the control group (Ctrl). The group BPA was orally administered 80 mg/kg/day BPA on the 15th day postpartum, while the group Ctrl received a corresponding volume of vehicle. Blood and milk samples were collected after 7 days treatment. The results showed that short-term ingestion of BPA did not obviously alter the body weight, feed intake, or milk yield of the lactating rabbits. ELISA assays indicated that BPA did not significantly affect the plasma levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), creatinine (CRE), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid (UA), and urea. Utilizing untargeted metabolomics, we first depicted the metabolomic profile of rabbit milk, and identified 277 differential metabolites (DMs), with 141 DMs upregulated (e.g., BPA, and its metabolites including Cetirizine N-oxide) and 136 DMs downregulated (e.g., Oleamide, Tiglic acid, PC O-38:4) in the group BPA. KEGG analysis revealed that the DMs were mainly enriched in pathways comprising fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, and phosphatidylinositol signaling system, emphasizing the effect of BPA on milk fat metabolism. Hence, we established the BPA-induced MAC-T model, and the results showed that BPA significantly reduced cell viability and impacted lipid synthesis, as evidenced by reduced lipid droplets (BODIPY and Oil Red O staining) and decreased expression of genes related to lipid synthesis (e.g., PPAR gamma, ACACA, LPL). In summary, we first drew the metabolomic profile of rabbit milk and confirmed that short-term BPA exposure impacted mammary lipid synthesis, thereby reducing the milk quality of lactating rabbits and providing fundamental data for resolving the toxicological mechanisms of BPA on mammal lactation.

AB The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) holds great potential for sustainable hydrogen production but developing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts remains challenging. Here, we report the synthesis of a hierarchical WC/NiCoW hollow nanotube array electrocatalyst, featuring rapid gas release to minimize bubble aggregation and reaction retardation. Mechanistic insights into the HER kinetics reveal enhanced electron transfer at the WC-NiCoW interface and an accelerated Volmer step. The optimized WC/NCW-600 exhibits superior HER activity and remarkable long-term stability for over 72 h in alternated acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes. This work highlights new insights into the rational structural design of durable electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

AB The quasi-synchronization (QS) issue of stochastic delayed reaction-diffusion neural networks (SDRDNNs) under deceptive attacks is investigated in this paper. A control strategy in terms of time-space sampled- data (TSSD) is presented for the QS issue of SDRDNNs under deceptive attacks, which can not only enhance the cybersecurity of communications but also reduce network bandwidth consumption. By looped Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional (LKF), free-weighting matrix (FWM) technique, second-order B-L integral inequality, It & ocirc;'s formula, generalized It & ocirc;'s isometry, Dynkin's formula and the extended Halanay's inequality, a newly less conservative QS criterion is established for SDRDNNs under norm-bounded deceptive attacks. Furthermore, to increase the feasibility of the QS criterion, by the total expectation formula and independent increment of Brownian motion, an innovative and effective method for estimating the mathematical expectation of the d ( t )-dependent cross-term in the corresponding FWM-based zero equation is proposed. Additionally, this study dt also develops the TSSD exponential synchronization (ES) criteria for SDRDNNs without deceptive attacks and for SDRDNNs under deceptive attacks with Bernoulli distribution. Finally, a simulated example consisting of three cases is provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

DE Clustering; Gravitation; Natural neighbor; Parameter-free algorithm
AB Clustering analysis is frequently used in data mining, image processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. Traditional approaches heavily rely on manually configured parameters, of which the initial selection exerts a profound influence on the clustering outcomes. In addition, they usually only consider the relationship between two individual samples when calculating distances, neglecting the overall structure of the dataset, which can negatively affect clustering performance. At the same time, many contemporary algorithms are tailored to specific datasets, posing challenges in achieving optimal clustering performance for intricate, noisy datasets. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive G ravitational C lustering Algorithm I ntegrated with N oise D etection called GCIND. Inspired by the law of gravitation, GCIND takes into account the natural neighborhood structure of the entire dataset, adaptively computing the gravitation between data points by leveraging shared neighbors and Euclidean distance relationships. Our algorithm initially identifies and eliminates outliers or edge points in the dataset. It subsequently uses gravitation to autonomously cluster the remaining core data. Finally, the removed data are reallocated to their respective clusters. GCIND has four notable advantages: (1) it uses gravitation to build the neighborhood graph, reflecting the overall dataset structure; (2) it demonstrates stronger robustness in handling noisy datasets; (3) it uses adaptive gravitational neighborhood graph clustering, removing manual parameter tuning; (4) it adapts to complex manifold-structured datasets, offering broad applicability. Experiments have shown that GCIND, without requiring any parameter settings, demonstrates slightly better performance than the algorithms compared in the study, especially when dealing with complex manifold datasets.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CONFIDENCE
AB This article studies how managerial overconfidence shapes a firm's digital transformation and unpacks the pathway and the boundary condition. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms between 2011 and 2022, we find that managerial overconfidence exhibits a positive relationship with corporate digital transformation and the relationship is mediated by R&D investment. In addition, we demonstrate that compared to state-owned companies, R&D investment has a more significant positive effect on digital transformation in non-state-owned companies. This study contributes novel insights about the consequences of cognitive biases of top managers and extends the studies for investigating top managers in the digital transformation age. The findings offer implications for top managers who have to fully recognize the impact of overconfidence on the development of the companies and the impact of overconfident executives on corporate digital transformation depending on R&D investment to create value. In addition, this study also reminds Chinese policymakers to improve the efficiency of converting R&D investment into digital transformation in state-owned enterprises.

ID PAGERANK
AB Programming education is becoming increasingly popular in universities. However, due to a lack of debugging experience, novices often encounter numerous difficulties in the programming process. Automatic fault localization techniques have emerged as a promising solution to address this issue. Among these techniques, Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) have been widely used in industrial programs. However, there is a significant difference between industrial and novice programs and the performance of these methods on novice programs has not been extensively studied.To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the fault localization performance and execution overhead of SBFL and MBFL in a typical novice programming environment. Our study specifically examined how different program characteristics, including code coverage and mutation score, affect the accuracy of these localization methods. Additionally, during the study, we identified the tie problem in both methods and further investigated its impact on fault localization techniques in novice programs.To remove the impact of the tie problem, we proposed using PageRank scores as weights for the suspiciousness, sorting, and locating faults based on the weighted suspiciousness. The PageRank algorithm is based on statement coverage information and constructs a directed graph. From the directed graph, a transition matrix generates the weight scores (PageRank scores) for each statement.Our research demonstrates that both SBFL and MBFL are effective for fault localization in novice programs, with MBFL showing significantly better performance in our tests. In TOP-N(N=1,3,5), MBFL accurately locates 67, 96 and 114 faults, respectively, indicating superior performance. Additionally, calculating weighted suspiciousness significantly alleviates the tie problem.

AB In the interdisciplinary domains of medicine and chemistry, addressing the issue of residual drugs (toxicants) that fail to fully exert therapeutic effects while potentially inducing toxic side effects has become increasingly critical. Researchers are actively seeking innovative solutions to this multifaceted challenge. Conventional smallmolecule antagonists, commonly used in clinical settings, typically depend on "drug-receptor interactions" yet pose substantial developmental challenges. Recent advancements in the investigation of macrocyclic host compounds present a promising alternative. By leveraging the principles of host-guest chemistry, these macrocyclic hosts form stable inclusion complexes with residual drugs (toxicants), thereby decreasing their free concentration in the bloodstream and effectively mitigating associated toxic side effects. Consequently, macrocyclic host compounds represent a novel class of supramolecular antagonists (SAs). This article reviews recent progress in the application of macrocyclic host molecules-such as cyclodextrin, calix[n]arene, pillar[n]arene, and cucurbit[n]uril-as SA and examines current issues and future development prospects within the field.

AB This paper studies the convergence rate of a second-order dynamical system associated with a nonsmooth bilinearly coupled convex-concave saddle point problem, as well as the convergence rate of its corresponding discretizations. We derive the convergence rate of the primal-dual gap for the second-order dynamical system with asymptotically vanishing damping term. Based on an implicit discretization scheme, we propose a primal-dual algorithm and provide a non-ergodic convergence rate under a general setting for the inertial parameters when one objective function is continuously differentiable and convex and the other is a proper, convex and lower semicontinuous function. For this algorithm we derive a O1/k2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$O\left( 1/k<^>2 \right) $$\end{document} convergence rate under three classical rules proposed by Nesterov, Chambolle-Dossal and Attouch-Cabot without assuming strong convexity, which is compatible with the results of the continuous-time dynamic system. For the case when both objective functions are continuously differentiable and convex, we further present a primal-dual algorithm based on an explicit discretization. We provide a corresponding non-ergodic convergence rate for this algorithm and show that the sequence of iterates generated weakly converges to a primal-dual optimal solution. Finally, we present numerical experiments that indicate the superior numerical performance of both algorithms.

AB Breast cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies in women worldwide. Zinc finger protein 32 (ZNF32) has been reported to be involved in autophagy and stem cell like properties of breast cancer cells. However, the effects, mechanisms, target genes and pathways of ZNF32 in breast cancer development have not been fully explored. In this study, stable ZNF32 overexpression breast cancer cell line was generated, and we used RNA-seq and RT-qPCR to quantify and verify the changes in transcription levels in breast cancer cells under ZNF32 overexpression. Transcriptome analysis showed that high expression of ZNF32 is accompanied by changes in downstream focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-AKT, HIPPO and TNF signaling pathways, which are critical for the occurrence and development of cancer. Multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly involved in cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, including 11 DEGs such as CA9, CRLF1 and ENPP2P with fundamental change of regulation modes. All the 11 DEGs were validated by RT-qPCR, and 9 of them contained potential transcriptional binding sequences of ZNF32 in their promoter region. This study provides a holistic perspective on the role and molecular mechanism of ZNF32 in breast cancer progression.

AB Introduction Monkeypox virus (MPXV) hosts are of multiple species, with a risk of cross-species transmission. This phenomenon poses a threat to unreported affected domestic animals and increases the risk to human public health. Clinical diagnostics continue to face challenges regarding specificity among poxviruses. The need for a rapid and precise assay to differentiate between MPXV clades I and II, as well as goatpox virus (GTPV) is essential for enhancing our capacity for disease prevention, control, and epidemiological investigation.Methods To address this need, we have successfully developed a multiplex real-time PCR assay targeting MPXV D14L gene for clade I, MPXV D18L gene for clade II, and GTPV RPO30 gene, which can simultaneously detect MPXV clades I and II as well as GTPV.Results The developed assay demonstrated high sensitivity, with limits of detection at 207.83 copies/reaction for MPXV clade I, 252.07 copies/reaction for MPXV clade II, and 208.72 copies/reaction for GTPV. Importantly, there was no cross-reactivity with other non-pox viruses which infect goats. The assay exhibited excellent repeatability, with coefficients of variation (CV%) for intra-assay and inter-assay ranging from 0.17% to 0.89% and 0.58% to 1.09%, respectively.Discussion This assay can serve as a vital resource to safeguard against the MPXV epidemic posing a threat to the life safety of goats, to mitigate potential risks to the sheep farming industry, and to prevent the transmission of MPXV to humans through sheep, which could act as a potential transmission vector for infection.

AB Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is a viral respiratory pathogen that infects cattle and causes significant economic losses. We generated a recombinant adenovirus called rHAd5-F + HN by expressing the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of BPIV3 using the human adenovirus serotype 5 (rHAd5). We evaluated its effects on humoral and cellular immune responses in mice (n = 45) and calves (n = 9). Serum antibody responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and neutralising antibodies (NAb). After boosting immunity with rHAd5-F + HN, mice produced significantly higher levels of antibodies against the BPIV3 genotype A and genotype C strains. The production of antibodies exceeded those produced by adenoviruses rHAd5-F and rHAd5-HN, which express the F and HN glycoprotein, respectively. The percentages of splenic CD3+/CD8+T lymphocytes and IL-4+ cytokines in rHAd5-F + HN mice were considerably higher than those in the control group. Mice immunised with rHAd5-F + HN exhibited much lower viral loads in the lungs and tracheas compared to the control group. Additionally, the lungs of mice vaccinated with rHAd5-F + HN showed no notable histopathological changes. On the other hand, rHAd5-F + HN produced a humoral immune response in calves. Following the booster intramuscular injection with the rHAd5-F + HN, the serum antibody levels against BPIV3 genotype C strain were 1:20 452, 1:1024, and 1:426 in calves, as detected by ELISA, HI, and NAb, respectively. The HI and NAb levels against the BPIV3 genotype A strain were 1:213 and 1:85 in calves, respectively. These results indicate that rHAd5-F + HN effectively induced immunity against BPIV3 infection.

AB As the hybrid between cattle and yak, cattleyak is a typical male sterile mammal, and the underlying mechanism for its spermatogenic arrest is still unclear. In this study, the coding region of cattleyak TAF4B gene was cloned by RT-PCR and analysed by bioinformatics. To investigate the effects of TAF4B on cellular proliferation and differentiation, an expression vector was generated and introduced into undifferentiated spermatogonia (UDSPG) of cattleyak. The results showed that the protein encoded by TAF4B did not contain the signal peptide sequence. The expression level of TAF4B in UDSPG of cattleyak was lower than that in yak, while the overexpression of TAF4B in cattleyak promoted the proliferation activity of cattleyak UDSPG. Meanwhile, the expression of proliferation and meiosis-related genes was increased but the differentiation-related genes were decreased. Therefore, the aberrant expression of TAF4B in cattleyak UDSPG possibly impaired its proliferation and differentiation equilibrium and decreased its growth potentiality, thereby reducing the quantity of UDSPG and affecting spermatogenesis. This study provided a potential approach for further elucidation of the mechanism of spermatogenesis arrest and provided a new idea for solving the problem of male infertility in cattleyak.

AB RationaleErigeron breviscapus (EB) and Erigeron multiradiatus (EM) are the two species of the genus Erigeron (Asteraceae) with extremely close genetic relationships. They were used as the same "meiduoluomi" for the treatment of plague and epidemics in traditional Tibetan medicine. But in traditional Chinese medicine, only EB is used for treatment of cerebrovascular obstruction, hemiplegia due to stroke, coronary artery obstruction, chest congestion, and angina pectoris. These two Erigeron species show different effects in different traditional medicine systems. Therefore, analyzing the chemical compositions of two species will not only enhance comprehension of their medicinal properties but also foster the advancement and exploration of novel applications. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive and detailed investigation comparing the constituents of EB and EM.MethodsA methodology for rapid identification of chemical profiles from two Erigeron species was devised through the integration of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) and multivariate statistical analysis. Additionally, a UHPLC-photo-diode array (PDA) method was established to precisely quantify of 11 components.ResultsA total of 58 constituents comprising flavonoids, phenolic acids, saponin, and long chain fatty acids were elucidated. Thirteen compounds were identified as potential differentiators in chemical profiles among the two Erigeron species. For quantitative assessment, 11 bioactive compounds were simultaneously quantified across 49 batches of Erigeron species samples utilizing UHPLC-PDA with wavelengths of 325, 254, and 266 nm. The method demonstrated excellent precision, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, stability, and recovery.ConclusionsThe findings from this study will serve as a reference for quality control, functional activity exploration, and improved clinical application based on the ingredient profiles of the two species. Furthermore, this inaugural investigation into the ingredient profiles of these two species will enhance the potential and optimal utilization of both EB and EM resources.

AB Homologous recombination events take place between the 5 ' and 3 ' long terminal repeats (LTRs) of ERVs, resulting in the generation of solo-LTR, which can cause solo-LTR-associated polymorphism across different genomes. In the current study, specific criteria were established for the filtration of solo-LTRs, resulting in an average of 5630 solo-LTRs being identified in 21 genomes. Subsequently, a protocol was developed for detecting solo-LTR polymorphisms in the pig genomes, resulting in the discovery of 927 predicted solo-LTR polymorphic sites. Following verification and filtration processes, 603 highly reliable solo-LTR polymorphic sites were retained, involving 446 solo-LTR presence sites (solo-LTR+) and 157 solo-LTR absence sites (solo-LTR-) relative to the reference genome. Intersection analysis with gene/functional regions revealed that 248 solo-LTR- sites and 23 solo-LTR+ sites overlapped with genes or were in the vicinity of genes or functional regions, impacting a diverse range of gene structures. Moreover, through the utilization of 156 solo-LTR polymorphic sites for population genetic analysis, it was observed that these solo-LTR loci effectively clustered various breeds together, aligning with expectations and underscoring their practical utility. This study successfully established a methodology for detecting solo-LTR polymorphic sites. By applying these methods, a total of 603 high-reliability solo-LTR polymorphic sites were pinpointed, with nearly half of them being linked to genes or functional regions.

ID NETWORKS
AB This paper discusses a new issue named domain generalization of fast motion planning in 3D environments, which benefits agility-required robot applications such as autonomous driving and uncrewed aerial vehicle obstacle avoidance flight. The existing work shows that conventional spatial search-based planning algorithms cannot meet the real-time requirement due to high time costs. The end-to-end neural network-based methods achieve an excellent balance between performance and planning speed in the seen environments, but are hard to transfer to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Robust Environment Encoder (Ro2En) approach to domain generalization of fast motion planning. Specifically, by demonstrating the reconstructed environment, we find that the previous environment encoder cannot encode the volume information properly, i.e., a volume collapse ensues, which leads to noisy environment modeling. Inspired by this observation, a dual-task auto-encoder is developed. It can not only reconstruct the point cloud of the obstacles, but also align their geometric centers. Experiment results showed that in the new scenarios, Ro2En outperformed previous state-of-the-art conventional and neural alternatives with a much smaller performance variation.

AB Different concentrations of sesamol (0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/g protein) were incorporated for evaluating the effects of sesamol on the structural and gel properties of yak myofibrillar proteins (MPs). The results manifested that the contents of active thiol and free amine diminished and the carbonyl contents elevated when the MPs modified with sesamol. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity progressively decreased and surface hydrophobic value displayed a down-up trend after binding with the increasement of sesamol. Moreover, the presence of sesamol reduced protein solubility and increased particle size of MPs. For the protein gels, inclusion of sesamol effectively improved water-holding capacity and gel strength but decremented gel whiteness and the proportion of free water, and significantly enhanced the hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds in the gel matrix. Microstructure analysis revealed that a more compact microstructure was formed for the MP-sesamol gels. This study suggests that sesamol is capable of improving the functional properties of MPs, and the complexes of MP-sesamol have potential applications in the food industry.

AB Background: Accurate diagnosis of cerebral ischemia severity is crucial for clinical decision making. Laser speckle contrast imaging-based cerebral blood flow imaging can help assess the severity of cerebral ischemia by monitoring changes in blood flow.Method: In this study, we simulated hyperacute ischemia in rats, isolating arterial and venous flow-related signals from cortical vasculature. Pearson correlation was used to examine the correlation between damaged vessels. Granger causality analysis was used to investigate causality correlation in ischemic vessels.Results: Resting state analysis revealed a negative Pearson correlation between regional arteries and veins. Following cerebral ischemia induction, a positive artery-vein correlation emerged, which vanished after blood flow reperfusion. Granger causality analysis demonstrating enhanced causality coefficients for middle artery-vein pairs during occlusion, with a stronger left-right arterial effect than that of right-left, which persisted after reperfusion.Conclusions: These processing approaches amplify the understanding of cerebral ischemic images, promising potential future diagnostic advancements.

AB The construction industry, a significant contributor to global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, is under considerable pressure to adopt transformative approaches. Public buildings, which account for a substantial portion of total energy usage, must balance high standards of thermal comfort with ventilation efficiency. In China, many public buildings are part of urban landscapes, where fa & ccedil;ade designs often limit natural ventilation. Consequently, technologies like earth-to-air heat exchangers and wind towers are increasingly essential for enhancing natural ventilation. However, research on the efficacy of these systems remains sparse. This study examines the transitional seasonal environment by evaluating the thermal-humidity index of a banquet hall equipped with an earth-to-air heat exchanger system. Using DeST software [DeST 2.0], the study simulates indoor natural ventilation, calculates ventilation rates, and assesses residual heat removal efficiency. The system's performance is also modeled under various thermal design zones. Results demonstrate that under natural ventilation, the system can achieve a residual heat removal efficiency of up to 490%. Simulations across different climate zones indicate that the system performs best in regions with extreme temperature fluctuations, particularly those with hot summers and warm winters. In these areas, the system reduces the annual temperature difference by up to 56.7%, significantly improving thermal comfort and reducing dependency on air conditioning. In contrast, performance in milder regions like Kunming achieves only a 37.5% reduction in temperature difference. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into energy-efficient design strategies and thermal optimization for banquet halls, with significant potential for energy savings and enhanced occupant comfort.

AB Background: Ticks represent a significant vector for the transmission of infectious diseases, with the prevalence of tick-borne diseases becoming a prominent global health concern in recent decades. Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., and Piroplasma have been identified as significant pathogens with the potential to impact human and animal health. However, there is a dearth of data concerning the prevalence of these pathogens in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China.Methods In this study, a total of 643 Dermacentor silvarum and 314 Haemaphysalis longicornis were identified through the application of morphological and molecular identification techniques on 957 ticks collected from yaks in Zoige County. The assessed of Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Theileria spp., and Babesia spp. was assessed in 957 ticks and 96 blood samples collected from yaks.Results Significant discrepancies were observed in the positivity rates for the four pathogens among the tick species and sampling sites. The identification of different species within the four pathogens was based on the analysis of the 16S rRNA of Anaplasma spp., the ompA and ompB genes of Rickettsia spp., and the 18S rRNA of Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. The prevalence ranges of the four pathogens are 9.9-50.2%, 29.5-100%, 16.2-46.4%, and 14.5-58.4%, respectively.Conclusion In view of the growing zoonotic risks, further investigations into the prevalence of additional pathogens in ticks and animals, including livestock, in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, are essential.

AB An efficient TCCA (trichloroisocyanuric acid)/RSeSeR-mediated selenoalkoxy of allenamides for the construction of selanyl-allylic N,OA-aminal derivatives was developed. The reaction exhibits good functional group tolerance and high efficiency, affording the products in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic investigations indicated that a selanyl-allylic radical intermediate was first formed via the RSe radical added to the central carbon of allenamides, which subsequently furnished highly stable selanyl-allylic carbocation intermediate by abstraction of an electron by the chlorine radical. Moreover, this is the first report of using selenium reagent (RSeCl) to activate allenamides via a radical process.

AB Fasting is typically used before feeding metabolizable energy assessment in broilers. Previous studies have shown that fasting cause atrophy of the intestinal villus. Whether fasting affects intestinal permeability during refeeding by altering barrier function and nutrient absorption is of concern. Here, 23-d-old broilers were randomly assigned to 5 treatments, fasted for 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, respectively, and then refed for 2 d, to study the impact of different duration of fasting on the intestinal regeneration and barrier function during refeeding. Results showed that the intestinal morphology in fasted birds was recovered in 2 d of refeeding at most. As fasting durations increased, enterocytes per intestinal villus were linearly and quadratically increased (both P <0.05), whereas goblet cells per intestinal villus was linearly decreased (both P <0.05). Besides, the mRNA level of lysozyme was linearly decreased as fasting durations increased during refeeding (both P <0.05), while quadratically increased mucin 2 was observed only after 1 d of refeeding (P<0.05). P <0.05). Linear increase effects were observed for claudin 2 and zonula occludens-1 with increased fasting durations after 1 d of refeeding (all P <0.05), and linear and quadratical effects were observed for claudin 2 at 2 d of refeeding (both P <0.05). Besides, we found that intestinal permeability to creatinine, 4 and 70 kD dextran were linearly and quadratically decreased with increased fasting durations at 6 h and 1 d of refeeding (all P <0.05). Furthermore, jejunum proteomic from birds refed for 6 h showed that birds fasted for 36 h showed increased antimicrobial peptides and upregulated retinol metabolism when compared to the nonfasted birds (P<0.05). P <0.05). Further study showed that retinyl ester catabolism was inhibited during fasting and enhanced during refeeding. Results of intestinal organoid culture showed that retinol benefits the cell proliferation and enterocyte differentiation. In conclusion, the intestinal permeability to small and large molecules was decreased during refeeding by strengthening the intestinal barrier function, and the activated retinol metabolism during refeeding is involved in the intestinal regeneration and strengthens the intestinal barrier.

DE Nanozyme; ROS regulation; Photo-thermal effect; Bacterial infection
AB Novel strategy is urgently needed to overcome the bacterial infection all over the world due to unreasonable use of biotics. In recent years, nanozymes have attracted great interests of researchers for their high catalytic efficiency and biocompatibility. In this study, a novel multiple enzyme-mimic polypeptide-based carbon nanoparticle was synthesized by N-carboxyanhydride mediated ring opening polymerization (ROP) and Fe coordination for actualizing ROS regulation and photo-thermal therapy. The multiple enzyme-mimic activities of the nanozyme, such as peroxidase, oxidase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, were detailly explored in ROS regulation for potential utilization in bacterial inhibition. The photo-thermal effect of the nanozyme was investigated under 808 nm NIR irradiation. Enhanced inhibition rate of the as prepared nanozyme was observed against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (99.03 %) and Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus (99.78 %) planktonic bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was chosen as the drug resistant bacteria model to evaluate the efficiency in bacterial biofilm disruption. Improved healing efficacy of 99.05 % against MRSA wound infection and excellent biosafety were observed in mice model experiments for the as prepared nanozyme. In conclusion, the as synthesized nanozyme with ROS regulation, enhanced bacteria inhibition, and excellent biocompatibility could be potentially applied in clinic against bacterial infection.

TI Novel design and implementation of 3d packaged wideband bandpass filters
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID LINES
AB This study presents an innovative method for designing a 3D packaged wideband bandpass filter (BPF) by vertically integrating a high-pass filter (HPF) and a low-pass filter (LPF) using an air cavity and vertical interconnect accesses (VIAs). This integration enhances performance while significantly reducing system size. The fabricated BPF, constructed on multilayer substrates, achieves a passband from 2.175 to 4.2 GHz with less than 2.5 dB insertion loss and a return loss exceeding 10 dB. The design utilizes a partial substrate integrated suspended line (SISL) structure, enabling precise control over the equivalent dielectric constant and characteristic impedance to optimize insertion loss. The height of the air cavity, determined through theoretical analysis and S-parameter inversion, is critical for achieving optimal filter performance. The methodology allows for independent circuit designs on each layer, resulting in a 3D assembly. This refined approach makes it easier to produce compact bandpass and multi-band filters, simplifying circuit development and enabling scalable fabrication. This design is versatile across different frequency ranges, demonstrating significant practical and theoretical benefits.

DE H-infinity control; mixed network attacks; multiple asynchronous
   switching; uncertain disturbed networked switched systems; updated
   optimized resilient dynamic event-triggered scheme
AB This article is concerned with the globally exponentially mean-square stabilization problem for uncertain disturbed networked switched systems (NSSs) subject to mixed network attacks and multiple asynchronous switching by exploring an optimized event-triggered scheme. First, we consider a new challenge of multiple asynchronous switching stemmed from the varying switching delays within the event-triggered scheme and controller. Second, assume that the data transmission network is subject to attacks consisting of deception attacks and aperiodic DoS attacks. Third, an optimized resilient dynamic event-triggered scheme (ORD-ETS) with switching behavior and external noises is proposed to intelligently reduce the inessential released data. For further improving the system performance, the updated ORD-ETS (UORD-ETS) is designed by introducing some fixed signals-released points. Then, based on the mode-dependent multiple Lyapunov functionals, integral inequality, incorporated switching signal technique and proposed asynchronous analysis method, some criteria are attained to ensure the globally exponentially mean-square stable of the uncertain disturbed NSSs with a weighted H(infinity )performance. Further, the co-design of the desired controller and the event-triggered scheme is achieved. Ultimately, a numerical simulation with comparative analysis and a practical simulation are conducted to substantiate the validity of the obtained results.

TI Modulation and control scheme for DC-link current minimization of an

DE Current source inverter (CSI); Modulation scheme; Control system;
   DC-link current
AB The traditional three-phase current source inverter (CSI) cannot maintain a constant DC-link current, the charging and discharging process under different operating modes will lead to the DC-link current being discontinuous or continuously increasing. To address this issue, the topology of CSI is improved, and a modulation scheme without additional losses is proposed in this paper to control the DC-link current. Then, based on the analysis of the DC-link ripple under all switching states, the calculation expression for the optimal reference of the DC-link current is derived, under the premise of meeting the current demand for the AC load, the minimum loss and harmonic distortion can be obtained by reducing the DC-link current. Finally, the math model of the ACside is established, and the closed-loop control system including the voltage outer loop and the current inner loop is designed. The feasibility and correctness of the proposed modulation strategy and control method are validated by the simulation and experimental results, the minimum and stable DC-link current with the ripple below +/- 1 A is obtained, and the high steady-state and dynamic control performances are achieved. The total harmonic distortion of the load current is less than 4 %, and the dynamic response time is 0.3 s.

AB The study aimed to explore the interaction between wilting pretreatment and different types of ensiling additives on silage quality, nutritional value, molecular structural features, and ruminal degradability of highland alfalfa. A total of 48 bags of alfalfa forage were randomly assigned into one of eight treatments in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement (6 replication bags/treatment). One kg of either unwilted (72 % moisture) or wilted (60 %) alfalfa forage was inoculated with acidic salt, lactic acid bacteria, organic acids, or left without additive (control). Our results indicated that the wilting process increased lactic acid and crude protein levels, decreased the NH3-N level in silage, and increased its in vitro DM digestibility (all P < 0.05). The wilting treatment increased the amide I/II ratio by 31.7 % and the total carbohydrate II regions by 19.6 % (both P < 0.05). Inoculating pre-wilted alfalfa with lactic acid bacteria further reduced the pH and NH3-N levels and increased the lactic acid level and DM digestibility in silage (all P < 0.05). The addition of organic acids decreased silage pH and increased lactic acid, crude protein, and starch contents, and DM digestibility (all P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that silage with a higher amide I/II peak height ratio and TC2 areas had more digestible nutrients and higher DM digestibility. In conclusion, wilting pretreatment combined with lactic acid bacteria inoculant is an effective approach to improve quality and nutrient availability of highland alfalfa silage. The non-invasion spectrometer has the potential to reveal the molecular spectral characteristics of alfalfa silage and predict nutrient availability.

AB Mycoheterotrophic plants acquire nitrogen (N) directly from the soil and through their symbiotic fungi. The fungi-derived N has received considerable attention, but the contribution of soil-derived N has been largely overlooked. We investigated how the leafless, rootless, and almost mycoheterotrophic orchid Cymbidium macrorhizon obtains soil N by applying 15N-labeled ammonium nitrate in its natural habitat, and tracking metabolite accumulation and mycorrhizal fungal association after N application. The decline of N in the rhizome from flowering to fruiting indicated a transfer of N from the rhizome to fruits. At current dose of N application (0.6 g NH4NO3 each plant), only 1.5% of the plant's N was derived from fertilizer, resulting in a low nitrogen use efficiency of 0.27%. The majority of those newly absorbed N (88.89%) was found sank in the rhizome. Amino acids (or their derivatives) and alkaloids were predominant differentially accumulated nitrogenous metabolites after N application, with amino acids occurring in both fruits and the rhizome, and alkaloids primarily in the fruits. The addition of N did not alter the richness of mycorrhizal fungi, but did affect their relative abundance. Our findings suggest that Cymbidium macrorhizon uses very limited soil inorganic nitrogen in its natural habitat, and the root-like rhizome primarily stores N rather than absorbs its inorganic forms, offering new insights into how mycoheterotrophic plants utilize soil N, and the influence of nutrient availability on the orchid-fungi association.

DE Loan portfolio insurance; Premium rate; Loan loss ratio; Absolute
   deductible; Relative deductible
AB From the perspective of the insurance deductible, this article constructs pricing models suitable for small and micro loan portfolio insurance under realistic conditions, and summarizes relevant pricing laws through examples. It is found that the option attribute of loan portfolio insurance contracts endowed by absolute or relative deductible clause can be used to price small and micro loan portfolio insurance. Meanwhile, owing to the offset effect of the loan portfolio on the credit risk of different single loans, the premium rate of loan portfolio insurance should be controlled between that of corresponding single loan insurance. Moreover, properly adjusting the deductible ratio, insurance period, and composition of the insured loan portfolio can create more space for reducing the insurance price of the loan portfolio or expanding insurance profits. Our study improves the pricing model system of small and micro loan insurance, which has important theoretical value and practical significance for the scientific pricing of loan portfolio insurance.

AB In this study, a quenching experiment was conducted at atmospheric pressure to investigate the flow and heat-transfer characteristics of cylindrical rods made from SS, FeCrAl, and Zr-4 under various subcooling degrees (Delta Tsub). The inverse heat-conduction problem (IHCP) method and image-processing technique were utilized to determine the surface temperature and heat flux, vapor film thickness, and quench front propagation. The results show that smaller solid k rho cp and larger Delta Tsub result in relatively more efficient quenching boiling heat transfer, thinner vapor film thickness, and greater quench front propagation velocity. The quench front originates at the bottom of the test specimen and becomes progressively larger in velocity with time. It eventually converges with the downward-propagating quench front in the upper middle of the test specimen. Moreover, at the beginning of quench front propagation, the SS and FeCrAl test specimens have a constant velocity region. However, because the Zr-4 test specimen has a small k rho cp, the velocities gradually increase from the onset of quench front generation. Furthermore, the measured average quench front velocities are consistent with the experimental datum from the literature. However, the predicted model proposed by Duffey underestimates the propagation velocity due to ignoring the cooling effect of film boiling.

AB With the expansion of the real estate sector and the rise of tourist resorts, many individuals now own multiple properties, resulting in a substantial number of homes remaining vacant for extended periods or being used seasonally. Despite being unheated, rooms in these vacant properties continue to transfer heat to adjacent heated rooms. While previous research has explored the heat transfer between non-heated and heated rooms based on their relative positioning, few studies have considered the dynamic aspects of this process. To fill this gap, we developed a scaled-down model to replicate real-world conditions and conducted experiments to track the dynamic temperature changes between non-heated and heated rooms in different configurations. The heat transfer mechanism was analyzed, and a theoretical model was constructed to quantify the dynamic heat exchange. This model accounts for variations in both convective and radiative heat transfer between rooms. Initial findings suggest that heat transfer to a non-heated room below a heated space can reach 28 % of the total heat supplied, while heat transfer to an upper adjacent room can account for 16 %. The peak heat transfer is observed after 5-10 h of heating. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing space heating, promoting energy-saving practices, and improving indoor heating efficiency, alongside offering actionable recommendations for behavioral energy conservation.

TI Boosting Commit Classification Based on Multivariate Mixed Features and
   Heterogeneous Classifier Selection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Commit classification; multivariate features; hyperparameter tuning;
   heterogeneous classifier selection
AB Commit classification plays a crucial role in software maintenance, as it permits developers to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and code review. There are several approaches for automatic commit classification, yet they do not sufficiently explore the features related to commits and consider the advantages of ensemble models over individual models. Therefore, there is some room for improvement. In this paper, we propose MuheCC, a commit classification approach based on multivariate mixed features and heterogeneous classifier selection to address these challenges. It mainly consists of three phases: (1) Multivariate mixed feature extraction, which extracts features from commit messages, changed code and handcrafted features to construct comprehensive mixed features; (2) Hyperparameter tuning based on genetic algorithm, which utilizes genetic algorithm to optimize candidate traditional models and ensemble models; (3) Heterogeneous classifier selection, which selects the optimal combinations of traditional and ensemble models, respectively, to build a heterogeneous classifier for commit classification. To evaluate this approach, we extend an existing dataset with code changes for each commit and compare MuheCC with three baselines on this real-world dataset. The results show that MuheCC outperforms all baselines, especially improving the best baseline by 7.25% for accuracy, 6.88% for precision, 7.25% for recall and 7.06% for F1-score. Furthermore, the ablation experiments validate that the performance advantage of MuheCC is mainly attributed to the multivariate features (e.g. 12.55% contributions to accuracy) and the heterogeneous classifier (e.g. 12.26% contributions to accuracy). We further discuss the impact of hyperparameter tuning and heterogeneous classifier selection on the performance of MuheCC. These results prove the superiority and potential practical value of MuheCC.

   Sanxingdui site
ID DIVERSITY
AB In southern China, vegetation on exposed earthen sites serves not only to mitigate erosion but also alters their visual appearance, leading to biodeterioration. However, how plants influence the properties of earthen sites is virtually unknown. This study undertook an ecological investigation of the original habitat in the east city wall of the Sanxingdui site, analyzing its soil properties and investigating plant-soil interactions. Research findings indicate that existing plant communities are not conducive to biodiversity nor site presentation. Plants exert a direct influence within a vertical range extending 0-40 cm beneath the site; root content correlates negatively with soil pH value but positively with organic matter content. The herbaceous community (E-2 and E-3) exhibits higher clay content than the arbor community (E-1) within this range. The above conclusions exhibit statistical significance. This study offers a scientific elucidation of the ecological parameters governing plant communities concerning the conservation of earthen sites, and provides an initial influence range of plant communities and biodegradation on the east city wall of the Sanxingdui sites, thereby revealing the technical potential for employing plants as a soft capping for earthen sites in the open air from the function method.

AB Background The Shoutai pill (STP) is a classic formulation in traditional Chinese medicine. Preliminary experimental observations from our study suggest that it is effective in enhancing endometrial receptivity. However, the underlying mechanisms by which STP influences endometrial receptivity remain to be elucidated.Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of the STP formulation in enhancing endometrial receptivity in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) model mice.Methods The network pharmacology analysis identified target proteins associated with the reduction of endometrial receptivity by STP. The COH mouse model was established using the GnRHa+PMSG+HCG protocol. The levels of MHC-1 and MHC-2 in mouse serum were measured using the ELISA method, while the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-10, IP-10, IL-1a, IL-2, IL-17, TNF-a, and IFN-y were measured using liquid chip technology.Results STP exhibited a significant improvement in the immune environment of COH model mice. The major active components of STP were identified as beta-sitosterol and quercetin, among others. Furthermore, AKT1, VEGFA, and several immune factors, such as TNF, IFN, IL-1 beta, and IL-10, were identified as key targets for regulating endometrial receptivity. STP enhanced the expression of IL-10, IL-4, and IP-10 in the mice while reducing the expression levels of IL-2, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in COH mice. These effects led to the modulation of early high expression of IL-1 beta and an improvement in endometrial receptivity.Conclusion This study demonstrates that STP can modulate in-vivo immune factors throughout the COH process, subsequently restoring the immune equilibrium within the endometrium, thereby enhancing the endometrial receptivity in the COH model mice.

AB Transglutaminase, an enzyme present in epithelial cells and as a residual component in processed foods, is hypothesised to interact with gastrointestinal mucus, impacting its structure and function. To test the physical validity of this phenomenon, this study investigates the binding kinetics and thermodynamics between porcine gastric mucin (PGM) and microbial transglumatinse (TGM) in a model gastrointestinal mucus, followed by the rheological analysis of the resulting systems. At pH 7, TGM exhibited pronounced binding with the PGM interface, characterised by a high surface density (55.34 +/- 1.86 mu g/m(-2)) and a low dissociation constant (K-D similar to 4.03 +/- 0.10 mu M) as determined by surface plasma resonance (SPR). Conversely, at pH 3, TGM showed weak adhesion onto PGM, resulting in a less stable binding, reflected by a lower surface density (10.94 +/- 0.67 mu g/m(-2)) and a higher dissociation constant (K-D similar to 6.24 +/- 0.22 mu M). Regardless of the nature of interaction, the Hill coefficients (n(H) >= 1) indicated that the binding sites were markedly denser at pH 7 (1383.38 +/- 46.47 pmol/m(-2)), than at pH 3 (273.68 +/- 16.84 pmol/m(-2)). Fluorimetry analysis suggested temperature-dependent dynamic binding between PGM and TGM. The resulting Benesi - Hildebrand plots illustrated a linear correlation between PGM and increasing TGM concentration, suggesting a single-step interaction mechanism. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated spontaneous interaction between PGM and TGM (Delta G < 0) via endothermic (entropic) interactions (Delta H > 0). Notably, hydrophobic forces played a significant role in the network stabilisation of PGM-TGM complex (Delta S > 0). Rheometry analysis elucidates that the interaction maxima within TGM-PGM systems substantially elevate both shear viscosity (eta), and the melting point (T-m), shifting from 6.75 +/- 0.28 to 70.94 +/- 2.21 (x10(-3)) Pa s (at 1 s(-1)), and 36.80 +/- 0.80 to 48.20 +/- 0.11 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, the coexistence of these two macromolecular species results in a 3- to 4-fold dramatic increase in the viscoelastic moduli of the binary complex. These findings build a strong physicochemical basis for the interaction between TGM and PGM, with profound effects on the rhological behaviour of the latter; it also highlights the need to examine the biochemical/enzymatic aspects of said interactions, and their potential effects on mucosa and human physiology.

AB Background Adipose tissue affects not only the meat quality of domestic animals, but also human health. Adipocyte differentiation is regulated by a series of regulatory genes and cyclins. Four and half-LIM protein (FHL2) is positively correlated with the hypertrophy of adipocytes and can cause symptoms such as obesity and diabetes. Result In the transcriptome sequencing analysis of intramuscular adipocytes after three days of differentiation, the differentially expressed gene FHL2 was found. To further explore the biological significance of the differentially expressed gene FHL2, which was downregulated in the mature adipocytes. We revealed the function of FHL2 in adipogenesis through the acquisition and loss of function of FHL2. The results showed that the overexpression of FHL2 significantly increased the expression of adipogenic genes (PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta) and the differentiation of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes. However, silencing FHL2 significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation. The overexpression of FHL2 increased the number of adipocytes stained with crystal violet and increased the mRNA expression of proliferation marker genes such as CCNE, PCNA, CCND and CDK2. In addition, it significantly increased the rate of EdU positive cells. In terms of apoptosis, overexpression of FHL2 significantly inhibited the expression of P53 and BAX in both intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes, which are involved in cell apoptosis. However, overexpression of FHL2 promoted the expression of BCL, but was rescued by the silencing of FHL2. Conclusions In summary, FHL2 may be a positive regulator of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, and acts as a negative regulator of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocyte apoptosis. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent elucidation of FHL2 in adipocytes.

AB Beta-defensins, such as beta-defensin 123 (DEFB123), are vital components of the immune system's defense against infections due to their strong antimicrobial properties and capacity for modulating the body's immunological responses. In this study, we successfully cloned and analyzed the yak DEFB123 gene sequence. Subsequently, we obtained recombinant protein DEFB123 (rDEFB123) through prokaryotic expression. Our results demonstrate that rDEFB123 effectively inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, rDEFB123 enhances the phagocytic activity of macrophages by regulating specific factors. In a mouse model infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the administration of rDEFB123 showed significantly lower levels of serum ALT and AST compared to the control group. Moreover, IFN-gamma and IgG were significantly increased in the rDEFB123-treated groups, indicating an enhanced immune response. In the MAPKs signaling pathway of the infected mouse lungs, the expressions of JNK, TRAF2, TRAF6, MIF, and IL-1 beta genes were downregulated in the rDEFB123-treated groups. Moreover, the levels of p-JNK protein were significantly decreased in these groups as well. Klebsiella pneumoniae caused systemic infection with organ damage in mice. However, the administration of rDEFB123 suppressed the expressions of inflammatory factors, thereby mitigating organ injury and regulating the activity of apoptosis-related factors to enhance immunity. These findings provide valuable theoretical data for future exploration of the functionality and potential applications of DEFB123 in yak.

AB Differences including reproductive efficiency have been proved existence between high-altitude yak (Bos grunniens) and low-altitude cattle (Bos taurus), however, the discrepancies of ovarian follicles across them are still elusive. In the present study, RNA-seq results exhibited an obvious separation of yak and cattle granulosa cells (GCs), and 2329 differently expressed genes (DEGs) was obtained, with 1297 upregulated and 1032 downregulated DEGs in yaks. Advanced analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly enriched in cellular structure, DNA packaging and remodeling (GO and GSEA), hypoxia adaptability, energy metabolism (KEGG and GSEA), and epigenetic modification of histones (Reactome and GSEA). Metabolite profiles of yak and cattle follicular fluid (FF) were depicted by LC-MS/MS non-target metabolomics, and 350 different metabolites (DMs) were acquired, with 242 upregulated and 108 downregulated DMs in yaks. The KEGG pathway enrichment results demonstrated that DMs were primarily enriched in metabolism including lipid, carbohydrate and nucleic acid metabolism. Finally, twenty-nine pathways were significant enriched via integrative analysis, most of which were associated with metabolism including carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis) and lipid metabolism (e.g. Sphingolipid metabolism). Of note, the key hypoxia adaptation pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, was predominant enriched. Overall, we ascertained that the heterogeneity in ovarian follicles of yaks and cattle was existence, which were mainly reflected on hypoxia adaptation and energy metabolism. These results implied that the above processes were evolved specifically for the normal development of yak follicles under plateau atmosphere.

AB Background The long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) retrotransposon has been identified as a specific substrate for fat mass and obesity-related gene (FTO), which facilitates the removal of N6-methyladenosine modifications from its targeted RNAs. Methods This study examined the dynamic interaction between FTO and LINE1 in yak tissues and muscle satellite cells, utilizing RT-qPCR, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), immunofluorescence staining, and techniques involving overexpression and interference of FTO and LINE1 to elucidate the relationship between FTO and LINE1 in yak tissues and muscle satellite cells. Results Cloning and analysis of the FTO coding sequence in Jiulong yak revealed a conserved protein structure across various Bos breeds, with notable homology observed with domestic yak, domestic cattle, and Java bison. Comprehensive examination of FTO and LINE1 gene expression patterns in Jiulong yaks revealed consistent trends across tissues in both sexes. FTO mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the heart and kidney, while LINE1 RNA was predominantly expressed in the heart. Immunoprecipitation confirmed the direct interaction between the FTO protein and LINE1 RNA in yak tissues and muscle satellite cells. The FTO-LINE1 axis was confirmed by a significant decrease in LINE1 RNA enrichment following its expression interference in yak muscle satellite cells. Overexpression of FTO substantially reduced the expression of recombinant myogenic factor 5 (MYF5). However, FTO interference had no discernible effect on MYF5 and myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) mRNA levels. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed no alterations in Ki-67 protein expression following FTO interference or overexpression. However, phalloidin staining demonstrated enhancement in the myotube fusion rate of yak muscle satellite cells upon LINE1 interference. Conclusion This comprehensive mapping of the FTO and LINE1 mRNA expression patterns establishes a direct interaction between the FTO protein and LINE1 RNA in yak. The findings suggest that FTO overexpression promotes muscle satellite cells differentiation, whereas LINE1 negatively regulates myotube fusion. The study provides fundamental insights into the role of the FTO-LINE1 axis in determining the fate of muscle satellite cells in yak, laying a solid theoretical foundation for future investigations.

AB The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) mt ) is triggered through eIF2 alpha phosphorylation in mammals. However, the mechanisms of UPRmt mt activation and the influence of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation on mitochondrial protein translation remain unclear. In this study, we confirmed that the UPRmt mt is a rapid and specific stress response that occurs through pharmacological induction of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation, along with the phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha, ATF4, and CHOP. Moreover, with the upregulation of the expression of some chaperones, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and DDIT4, as determined by RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling, eIF2 alpha phosphorylation was found to be essential for the expression of ATF4 and CHOP, after which ATF4 trafficked into the nucleus and initiated CHOP expression. In addition, the generation of ROS and mitochondrial morphology were not affected by the GTPP-induced UPRmt. mt . Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which HRI kinase-mediated UPRmt mt is induced by mitochondrial unfolded proteins via CRISPR-Cas9 technology, mitochondrial recruitment of HRI and interaction with other proteins. Moreover, we confirmed that mitochondrial protein translation and mitochondrial protein import were inhibited through eIF2 alpha phosphorylation with the accumulation of unfolded mitochondrial proteins. These findings reveal the molecular mechanism of the UPRmt mt and its impact on cellular protein translation, which will offer novel insights into the functions of the UPRmt, mt , including its implications for human disease and pathobiology.

AB Introduction: The allocation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) among plant organs is an important strategy affecting growth and development as well as ecological processes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, due to lack of systematic investigation data, the allocation strategies of N and P in the three primary plant organs (e.g., leaves, stems and roots) are still unclear. Methods: A total of 912 individuals of 62 Artemisia species were examined across a broad environmental expanse in China, and the N and P concentrations of leaves, stems and roots were measured to explore the allocation strategies in different subgenera, ecosystem types, and local sites. Results and discussion: Across all 62 species, the N vs. P scaling exponents for leaves, stems and roots were 0.67, 0.59 and 0.67, respectively. However, these numerical values differed among subgenera, ecosystem types, and local sites. Overall, the numerical values of N vs. P scaling exponents comply with a 2/3-power function for each Artemisia organ-type reflecting a phylogenetically conserved allocation strategy that has nevertheless diversified with respect to local environmental conditions. These results inform our understanding of N and P stoichiometric patterns and responses to abiotic factors in an ecologically broadly distributed angiosperm genus.

AB The intelligent senses (Electronic nose and tongue), were combined with headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and free amino acid were used in combination to determine the aroma and taste components during the processing of Chinese traditional dish Steamed beef with rice flour (SBD). The findings revealed that E-nose and E-tongue, could clearly distinguish and identify the aroma and taste of SBD. A total of 66 volatile substances and 19 free amino acids were identified by HS-GC-IMS and amino acid analyzer, respectively. The highest contribution to aroma in the production of SBD was alcohols, esters and aldehydes. Further analysis of relative odor activity showed that 3-Methylbutanol-D, 3-Methylbutanol-M and 3-Methylthio propanal is the marinating stage (T2) main aroma components. Ethyl 3-methylbutanoate-M and Ethyl 3-methylbutanoate-D were the main aroma components in the seasoning stage (T3). Additionally, the calculation of the taste activity value showed that Glutamic contributed significantly to the umami of SBD. Alanine was a representative taste component in the marinating stage (T2), while Proline, Aspartic, Lysine, Glutamic, Valine, Arginine, and Histidine were characteristic amino acids of the seasoning stage (T3). Consequently, this study offers valuable insights into the industrial-scale production and flavor regulation of SBD products.

AB Fludarabine (FA) is still considered as a first-line chemotherapy drug for hematological tumors related to B lymphocytes. However, it is worth noting that the non-specific distribution and non-different cytotoxicity of FA may lead to irreversible consequences such as central nervous system damage such as blindness, coma, and even death. Therefore, it is very important to develop a system to targeting delivery FA. In preliminary studies, it was found that B lymphoma cells would specific highly expressing the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 2 (known as CD22). Inspired by the specific recognition of sialic acid residues and CD22, we have developed a supramolecular prodrug based on polysialic acid, an endogenous biomacromolecule, achieving targeted-therapy of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Specifically, the prepared hydrophobic reactive oxygen species-responsive FA dimeric prodrug (F2A) interacts with the TPSA, which polysialic acid were modified by the thymidine derivatives, through non-covalent intermolecular interactions similar to "Watson-Crick" base pairing, resulting in the formation of nanoscale supramolecular prodrug (F@TPSA). Cell experiments have confirmed that F@TPSA can be endocytosed by CD22+ B lymphoma cells including Raji and Ramos cells, and there is a significant difference of endocytosis in other leukocytes. Furthermore, in B-NHL mouse model, compared with FA, F@TPSA is determined to have a stronger tumor targeting and inhibitory effect. More importantly, the distribution of F@TPSA in vivo tends to be enriched in lymphoma tissue rather than nonspecific, thus reducing the leukopenia of FA. The targeted delivery system based on PSA provides a new prodrug modification strategy for targeted treatment of B-NHL.

AB This paper addresses the strong consensus problem of convex second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs) with time-varying topologies. The convex second-order discrete-time MAS model is derived from the Langevin equation and therefore has a certain physical significance. The strong consensus here means that all the first- and second-order states converge to an identical value. Some fully distributed control protocols are designed with time-varying weights randomly chosen from an arbitrary finite set. These protocols are applicable to several cases where changing topologies may be directed or undirected, and connected or disconnected. As a special case, the condition for convex second-order MASs with fixed topologies to achieve the strong consensus is presented. Finally, two simulation examples illustrate the proposed results.

AB Studies have shown that playing violent video games is negatively related to the occurrence of prosocial behavior, but the underlying physiological mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the mediating role of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reduction in the relations between violent video game experiences and prosocial behavior among 155 Chinese undergraduate students (59.35% male, M-age = 18.62 years). Violent video game experiences (i.e., comprehensive evaluation of the violence, bloodiness, and individual duration of playing) and prosocial behavior (i.e., willingness to help and helping time) were both measured by self-report. Physiological data (i.e., electrocardiography) were collected across three laboratory stages: baseline, task, and recovery. RSA reduction was calculated through these physiological data. Results indicated that: (1) violent video game experiences were negatively associated with prosocial behavior and RSA reduction; (2) RSA reduction mediated the relations between violent video game experiences and prosocial behavior. This finding suggested that RSA reduction might be an important physiological mechanism explaining the negative relations between violent video game experiences and prosocial behavior. This study will deepen people's understanding of the influence of violent video games and provide a richer literature on the physiological mechanisms in the field.

AB Objective: This study aimed to explore the mediating role of general self-efficacy in the influence of social media identity bubble reinforcement on the happiness index among Chinese medical staff.Methods: This study utilized data (n = 877) from the 2022 Psychological and Behavioral Investigation of Chinese Residents (PBICR) related to medical staff. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 software, and the relationships between general self-efficacy, social media identity bubble reinforcement, and the happiness index of Chinese medical staff were examined using AMOS 23.0 software.Results: The happiness index of Chinese medical staff was scored at 2.93 +/- 1.21 for each item. Social media identity bubble reinforcement among Chinese medical staff was posi-tively correlated with general self-efficacy (r = 0.380, P < .001), as well as with the happiness index (r = 0.330, P < .001). General self-efficacy was positively correlated with the happiness index (r = 0.575, P < .001) and was found to mediate the relationship between social media identity bubble reinforcement and the happiness index of Chinese medical staff. In terms of the mediating effect of social media identity bubble reinforcement, the direct effect's 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.031-0.142, accounting for 34.68% of the total effect, which is statistically significant (P = .015), while the 95% CI of the indirect effect was 0.125-0.212, representing 65.32% of the total effect, also statistically significant (P = .005).Conclusion: Social media identity bubble reinforcement and general self-efficacy were found to be important factors influencing the happiness index of medical staff. Hospital managers and policymakers can thus enhance the social media identity bubble reinforce-ment and general self-efficacy of Chinese medical staff through effective measures to improve their happiness indices

AB Natural neighbor (NaN) algorithm, as a parameter-free alternative to KNN, is widely used in various fields such as pattern recognition and machine learning. However, the original NaN algorithm only takes the Euclidean distance of the samples as the only criterion for similarity calculation. It does not reasonably reflect the relationship between the samples and affects convergence and accuracy. Newtonian mechanics considers the effect of forces from many perspectives. Consequently, in this paper, Newtonian mechanics is introduced to calculate the relationship between samples, then the Newtonian mechanics-based Natural Neighbor algorithm (NMNN) is proposed. At first, it introduces Newton's first, second, and third laws and the idea of gravity in the natural neighbor algorithm. Then, it computes the mass of the samples by the natural neighbor density. Moreover, it updates the similarity matrix through Newtonian mechanics, which makes the calculation results more accurate. The formation process of the natural neighbor can be regarded as the spontaneous mutual attraction of samples based on traction. Finally, the experimental results show that the convergence performance of the NMNN algorithm is better than that of the NaN algorithm, and it can achieve better results in applications such as unbalanced data, clustering, and outlier detection.

AB Rapid on-site assessment of arsenic contamination in soils is crucial for environmental protection and human health. In order to build an effective and affordable device for the determination of arsenic, the use of carrier gas supplies and high power energy consumption largely limit the miniaturization of microplasma-based optical emission spectrometry (OES). An arc igniter microplasma (AIM) can be powered by a low DC power supply and operated in the atmosphere of air without gas infusion, which is beneficial to construct a carrier-gas free and low power supply setup. Hydride generation (HG) can improve sample transport efficiency and reduce matrix effects, but the generated by-product hydrogen has not been explored as a sole working gas for plasma excitation. In this work, a hydride generation arc igniter microplasma optical emission spectrometer (HG-AIM-OES) was fabricated for detecting arsenic in soils. H2 derived from HG was served as a working gas to transport AsH3 to excite, eliminating the use of a carrier gas unit. Under the optimized operating conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) for arsenic was 164 mu g/L (the analytical line at 234.98 nm), and good linearity of the method was achieved in the range of 0.5-20 mg/L with a precision of 3.14 % (the concentration of arsenic at 1 mg/L). In addition, the influence of H2 on AIM physical properties was carefully studied in the air and Ar discharge atmospheres. The accuracy of the proposed device was validated by the analysis of certified reference materials (CRMs) and a real soil sample, resulting in good agreement with the obtained results by air and Ar as working gas. This HG-AIMOES system provides a miniaturized, carrier gas-free and low power consuming tool for monitoring and assessment of arsenic-contaminated soils.

AB Bacterial co-infected pneumonia is an acute inflammatory reaction of the lungs mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics are urgently important but have the disadvantage of antibacterial resistance, and alternative treatments with medicinal plants are attractive. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Thalictrum delavayi Franch. (T. delavayi) is an important member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae), is rich in alkaloids and has been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. In this study, the extraction process of total alkaloids from the whole T. delavayi plant was optimized and the extract's therapeutic potential against pulmonary infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was investigated. The results showed that the optimum experimental conditions for the total alkaloids (2.46%) from T. delavayi were as follows: hydrochloric acid volume fraction of 0.8%, solid-liquid ratio of 1:12 and sonication time of 54 min. The treatment reduced bacterial counts, white blood cell counts and inflammatory cell classification in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum in experimental groups. The results in our experimental preliminary work suggested that the total alkaloids from T. delavayi had therapeutic effects on mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli mixed infectious pneumonia, providing experimental support for the plant's therapeutic potential in treating pulmonary infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

ID PROTOCOL; DEPTH; COMMUNICATION; DBR
AB Three main kinds of underwater wireless communication, which employ acoustic waves, radio frequency and optical waves, have attracted intensive research interests in recently years. Among them, the underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is characterized by high propagation speed and large transmission bandwidth. But, the optical waves in underwater environment are significantly affected by absorption and scattering effects, which limit their transmission range. In order to enhance the performance of UOWC, designing a transmission and energy efficiency routing algorithm has become a non -ignorable issue in UOWC. In this paper, a transmission distance adaptive dual -hop (TDAD) routing algorithm is proposed for underwater optical wireless networks (UOWNs) to improve their efficiency in packet -delivery and energy -consumption. Unlike the existing routing algorithms designed for UOWNs, which pre-set the transmission range of network nodes, the proposed TDAD algorithm adaptively selects the transmission range for each node according to the diversity of heterogeneous service requests and employs location and energy information in its dual -hop based routing procedure. Simulation results indicate that the proposed TDAD algorithm remarkably improves packet delivery rate with more balanced energy consumption when compared to the deviation angle -based single -hop (DAS) algorithm and the distributed sector -based (DS) routing algorithm.

AB This study aimed to elucidate the effects of broiler embryos soaked in ferulic acid (FA) solution on alleviating the negative impact of thermal manipulation (TM) on chicken embryo development and to provide a theoretical and experimental basis for applying TM and FA in the poultry feeding industry. A total of 120 broiler fertilized eggs were randomly divided into three groups: control group, TM group, and comprehensive group (TM + FA), with 40 eggs in each group. The TM group and the comprehensive group from the 7th embryonic age to the 16th embryonic age received TM for ten days, treated with a temperature of 39.5 degrees C and relative humidity of 65% for 18 h a day. In the comprehensive group, broiler embryos were immersed in FA solution at a concentration of 80 mg/L for 6 min at 16:00 every day from the 6th to the 8th embryo age. They were incubated continuously after being soaked until the chicks hatched. The results showed that the rates of dead embryos and weak chicks in the TM group were significantly higher than those in the control group and comprehensive group. Chick body temperatures of the TM group and comprehensive group were significantly lower than those of the control group. The heart weights of the TM group and comprehensive group were significantly lower than those of the control group, and the leg weights of the TM group were significantly decreased compared with those of the control group and comprehensive group. The SOD activity of serum in the comprehensive group was significantly higher than that in the control group and TM group, while the CAT activity of serum in the comprehensive group and control group was significantly higher than that in the TM group; however, there was no difference between the comprehensive group and control group. The activities of SOD and CAT in the liver were significantly higher than those of the TM group; however, the MDA content of the liver in the comprehensive group and control group was significantly lower than that of the TM group. The gene expression of Nrf2 and SOD in the comprehensive group and TM group was significantly higher than that in the control group; however, there was no significant difference between the comprehensive group and TM group. Soaking broiler embryonic eggs in an FA solution can improve the antioxidant capacity of the liver by upregulating Nrf2-Keap1 signal pathway-related gene expression. FA can effectively alleviate the side effects of TM on chicken embryos and does not impact the effects of TM.

AB Maize, a salt-sensitive crop, frequently suffers severe yield losses due to soil salinization. Enhancing salt tolerance in maize is crucial for maintaining yield stability. To address this, we developed an introgression line (IL76) through introgressive hybridization between maize wild relatives Zea perennis, Tripsacum dactyloides, and inbred Zheng58, utilizing the tri-species hybrid MTP as a genetic bridge. Previously, genetic variation analysis identified a polymorphic marker on Zm00001eb244520 (designated as ZmSC), which encodes a vesicle-sorting protein described as a salt-tolerant protein in the NCBI database. To characterize the identified polymorphic marker, we employed gene cloning and homologous cloning techniques. Gene cloning analysis revealed a non-synonymous mutation at the 1847th base of ZmSC(IL76), where a guanine-to-cytosine substitution resulted in the mutation of serine to threonine at the 119th amino acid sequence (using ZmSC(Z58) as the reference sequence). Moreover, homologous cloning demonstrated that the variation site derived from Z. perennis. Functional analyses showed that transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing ZmSC(Z58) exhibited significant reductions in leaf number, root length, and pod number, alongside suppression of the expression of genes in the SOS and CDPK pathways associated with Ca2+ signaling. Similarly, fission yeast strains expressing ZmSC(Z58) displayed inhibited growth. In contrast, the ZmSC(IL76) allele from Z. perennis alleviated these negative effects in both Arabidopsis and yeast, with the lines overexpressing ZmSC(IL76) exhibiting significantly higher abscisic acid (ABA) content compared to those overexpressing ZmSC(Z58). Our findings suggest that ZmSC negatively regulates salt tolerance in maize by suppressing downstream gene expression associated with Ca2+ signaling in the CDPK and SOS pathways. The ZmSC(IL76) allele from Z. perennis, however, can mitigate this negative regulatory effect. These results provide valuable insights and genetic resources for future maize salt tolerance breeding programs.

AB Field ridges are commonly viewed as the stable semi-natural habitats for maintaining plant diversity in the agricultural landscape. The high plant diversity could further support higher animal diversity. But following the adoption of well-facilitated farmland construction measures in China, many field ridges have been disproportionately neglected or destroyed. Empirical studies delineating the relationships between plant and animal diversity in these field ridges in the paddy landscape remain scant, especially in China, which has the most rice production. A two-year field ridge evaluation was conducted in the Chengdu Plain area, covering 30 paddy landscapes. This investigation scrutinizes the shape attributes of field ridges, their plant diversity, and the associated animal alpha-diversity and community compositions, including spiders, carabids, birds, frogs, and rice planthoppers. In the results of Pearson's correlation analysis, a significant inconsistent correlation was observed between plant diversity and animal diversity. The analysis of community structure heterogeneity also revealed no correspondence for species composition between plant and animal communities (i.e., spiders, carabids, and birds), while the non-metric multidimensional scale analysis indicated a substantial difference in the species composition of spiders or plants even within the same field ridge between 2020 and 2021. We argue that the implementation of intensive management practices in paddy landscapes, such as machine ploughing and harvesting and herbicide spraying with drones, leads to a scarcity of stable animal and plant communities in field ridges. Therefore, besides retaining these field ridges in paddy landscapes, maintaining the long-term stable ridges by refraining from herbicide spraying or artificial weeding, as well as avoiding winter wheat cultivating in field ridges, will contribute to protecting biodiversity of field ridges as semi-natural habitats.

AB Tibetan-speaking patients seeking care in predominantly Mandarin-speaking healthcare settings frequently face communication barriers, leading to potential disparities and difficulties in accessing care. To address this issue, we translated, culturally adapted, and validated the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Global Rating of Change (GRoC) into Tibetan (NPRS-Tib and GRoC-Tib), aiming to facilitate cross-linguistic and cross-cultural interactions while examining potential challenges in the adaptation process. Using standard translation-backward translation methods, expert review, pilot testing, and validation through a cross-sectional study with a short-term longitudinal component, we engaged 100 Tibetan patients with musculoskeletal trauma for psychometric validation, including 37 women (aged 22-60 years, mean age 39.1 years). The NPRS-Tib and GRoC-Tib exhibited outstanding psychometric properties, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.983 for NPRS-Tib indicating superb test-retest reliability, and expert review confirming good content validity for both instruments. A Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rho) of -0.261 (P = 0.0087) revealed a significant, albeit weak, correlation between changes in NPRS-Tib scores and GRoC-Tib scores. The adaptation process also presented notable challenges, including translation discrepancies from translators' diverse backgrounds and levels of expertise, ambiguity in scale options, and the lack of established tools for criterion validity assessment in Tibetan.

AB Childhood abuse experiences are risk factor for peer victimization. However, the process by which childhood abuse experiences influence peer victimization remains less clear. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of self-control, depression, and aggression in childhood abuse experiences and peer victimization. Using Childhood Abuse Questionnaire, Peer Victimization Questionnaire, Self-Control Questionnaire, and Problematic Behavior Questionnaire, 1521 Chinese adolescents (901 girls, 620 boys, average age = 14.74 +/- 1.55) who had experienced abuse in childhood participated in this survey. Structural equation modeling showed that self-control, aggression, and depression were mediators between childhood abuse experiences and peer victimization. Specifically, self-control, aggression, and depression acted as separate mediators. Additionally, there were two other pathways: the chain mediating effect of self-control and aggression, and the chain mediating effect of self-control and depression. This study enriches relevant research in peer victimization and provides a theoretical basis for understanding the impact of childhood abuse experiences on peer victimization.

AB Eomecon chionantha Hance, an endemic species in China, has a long medical history in Chinese ethnic minority medicine and is known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, studies of E. chionantha are lacking. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of the E. chionantha chloroplast genome and determined the taxonomic position of E. chionantha in Papaveraceae via phylogenetic analysis. In addition, we determined molecular markers to identify E. chionantha at the molecular level by comparing the chloroplast genomes of E. chionantha and its closely related species. The complete chloroplast genomic information indicated that E. chionantha chloroplast DNA (178,808 bp) contains 99 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNAs, and 37 tRNAs. Meanwhile, we were able to identify a total of 54 simple sequence repeats through our analysis. Our findings from the phylogenetic analysis suggest that E. chionantha shares a close relationship with four distinct species, namely Macleaya microcarpa, Coreanomecon hylomeconoides, Hylomecon japonica, and Chelidonium majus. Additionally, using the Kimura two-parameter model, we successfully identified five hypervariable regions (ycf4-cemA, ycf3-trnS-GGA, trnC-GCA-petN, rpl32-trnL-UAG, and psbI-trnS-UGA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the complete chloroplast genome of E. chionantha, providing a scientific reference for further understanding of E. chionantha from the perspective of the chloroplast genome and establishing a solid foundation for the future identification, taxonomic determination and evolutionary analysis of this species.

AB This study aimed to investigate the dose-effect of iron on growth performance, antioxidant function, intestinal morphology, and mRNA expression of jejunal tight junction protein in 1- to 21-d-old yellow-feathered broilers. A total of 720 1-d-old yellow-feathered male broilers were allocated to 9 treatments with 8 replicate cages of 10 birds per cage. The dietary treatments were consisted of a basal diet (contained 79.6 mg Fe kg(-1)) supplemented with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 160, 320, 640, and 1,280 mg Fe kg(-1) in the form of FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O. Compared with the birds in the control group, birds supplemented with 20 mg Fe kg(-1) had higher average daily gain (ADG) (P<0.0001). Adding 640 and 1,280 mg Fe kg(-1) significantly decreased ADG (P<0.0001) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) (P<0.0001) compared with supplementation of 20 mg Fe kg(-1). Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in plasma and duodenum increased linearly (P<0.0001), but MDA concentration in liver and jejunum increased linearly (P<0.05) or quadratically (P<0.05) with increased dietary Fe concentration. The villus height (VH) in duodenum and jejunum, and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (V/C) in duodenum decreased linearly (P<0.05) as dietary Fe increased. As dietary Fe increased, the jejunal relative mRNA abundance of claudin-1 decreased linearly (P=0.001), but the jejunal relative mRNA abundance of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin decreased linearly (P<0.05) or quadratically (P<0.05). Compared with the supplementation of 20 mg Fe kg(-1), the supplementation of 640 mg Fe kg(-1) or higher increased (P<0.05) MDA concentrations in plasma, duodenum, and jejunum, decreased VH in the duodenum and jejunum, and the addition of 1,280 mg Fe kg(-1) reduced (P<0.05) the jejunal tight junction protein (claudin-1, ZO-1, occludin) mRNA abundance. In summary, 640 mg of supplemental Fe kg(-1) or greater was associated with decreased growth performance, increased oxidative stress, disrupted intestinal morphology, and reduced mRNA expression of jejunal tight junction protein.

AB A method for generation of SVI sulfones from beta-sulfinyl esters (SIV) under transition-metal-free non-oxidative mild conditions is presented. Various sulfones have been achieved with moderate to excellent yields. The advantage of using beta-sulfinyl esters as masked aryl sulfinates has also been exemplified using brominated substrates. Oxygen isotope-labeling experiments indicated that the oxygen atoms incorporated into the sulfone product come from the sulfoxide of the beta-sulfinyl ester. Successive beta-elimination/O-addition/sulfinate esterification/beta-elimination processes are proposed for the mechanism of generating SVI from SIV.
   A method for generation of SVI sulfones from beta-sulfinyl esters (SIV) under transition-metal-free non-oxidative mild conditions is presented.

AB Accurate and rapid bandgap prediction is a fundamental task in materials science. We propose graph neural networks with transfer learning to overcome the scarcity of training data for high-fidelity bandgap predictions. We also add a perturbation-based component to our framework to improve explainability. The experimental results show that a framework consisting of graph-level pre-training and standard fine-tuning achieves superior performance on all high-fidelity bandgap prediction tasks and training-set sizes. Furthermore, the framework provides a reliable explanation that considers node features together with the graph structure. We also used the framework to screen 105 potential photovoltaic absorber materials.

AB Dihydromyricetin (DMY) was employed to reduce the yield of furfural derived from the Amadori rearrangement product of l-threonine and d-xylose (Thr-ARP) by trapping Thr-ARP, 3-deoxyxyosone (3-DX), and furfural to form adducts. The effect of different concentrations of DMY at different pH values and temperatures on the reduction of furfural production was studied, and the results showed that DMY could significantly reduce furfural production at higher pH (pH 5-7) and lower temperature (110 degrees C). Through the surface electrostatic potential analysis by Gaussian, a significant enhancement of the C-6 nucleophilic ability at higher pH (pH >= 5) was observed on DMY with hydrogen-dissociated phenol hydroxyl. The nucleophilic ability of DMY led to its trapping of Thr-ARP, 3-DX, and furfural with the generation of the adducts DMY-Thr-ARP, DMY-3-DX, and DMY-furfural. The formation of the DMY-Thr-ARP adduct slowed the degradation of Thr-ARP, caused the decrease of the 3-DX yield, and thereby inhibited the conversion of 3-DX to furfural. Therefore, DMY-Thr-ARP was purified, and the structure was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results confirmed that C-6 or C-8 of DMY and carbonyl carbon in Thr-ARP underwent a nucleophilic addition reaction to form the DMY-Thr-ARP adduct. In combination with the analysis results of Gaussian, most of the DMY-Thr-ARP adducts were calculated to be C-6-DMY-Thr-ARP. Furthermore, the formation of DMY-furfural caused furfural consumption. The formation of the adducts also shunted the pathway of both Thr-ARP and 3-DX conversion to furfural, resulting in a decrease in the level of furfural production.

AB With the continuous development of urbanization in our country, the contradiction between the protection of traditional village heritage architecture and the development of modern urban lifestyle is becoming increasingly prominent. With the introduction of China's rural revitalization strategy, improving the rural living environment, promoting sustainable development, utilizing renewable energy for power supply, and achieving low-carbon architecture have become particularly important. This article investigates the relationship between solar energy system and site layout in illustrative historic buildings, and uses thermal-economic methods for feasibility analysis of such old building retrofitting program toward nearly zero energy construction. The preliminary results indicate that integrating solar panel roof with old building body for renewable energy exploitation can achieve good economic benefits while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This work provides reference insights into the sustainable transformation of traditional rural heritage conservation buildings in our country and proposes feasible solutions to reconcile the contradiction between the preservation of traditional architectural heritage and sustainable modernization demands.

DT Article
DE Lossy image compression; artifact reduction; transformer; deep learning
AB This paper proposes an image compression algorithm based on Swin Transformer and residual network (STRN), aiming to reduce blurring and distortions in traditionally compressed images. The algorithm utilizes a dual-channel mechanism to remove artifacts from the image, which takes advantage of the complementary features of the transform and residual networks. The Swin Transformer networks address the issue of long-range dependency, leading to an enhanced and improved reconstructed image quality. The residual network is an effective network that mitigates gradient loss and recovers image details during the image compression process. The paper demonstrates that image compression can be achieved by training a convolutional network based on a transformer and residuals network, which significantly reduces artifacts and provides better reconstructed image quality compared to previously used and current mainstream methods based on traditional convolutional neural networks. The proposed approach can remove blocking artifacts by subtracting estimated artifacts from the input image, while still preserving most of the original details. Therefore, our proposed method is highly effective in improving image quality and reducing visual artifacts caused by traditional compression methods. Moreover, this method is useful for enhancing image transmission and storage efficiency in various computer vision systems that employ digital visual codecs.

AB Thaumarchaeota are predominant in oligotrophic habitats such as deserts and arid soils, but their adaptations to these arid conditions are not well understood. In this study, we assembled 23 Thaumarchaeota genomes from arid and semi-arid soils collected from the Inner Mongolia Steppe and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Using a comparative genomics approach, integrated with 614 Thaumarchaeota genomes from public databases, we identified the traits and evolutionary forces that contribute to their adaptations to aridity. Our results showed that the newly assembled genomes represent an early diverging group within the lineage of ammonia-oxidising Thaumarchaeota. While the genomic functions previously identified in arid soil lineages were conserved across terrestrial, shallow-ocean and deep-ocean lineages, several traits likely contribute to Thaumarchaeota's adaptation to aridity. These include chlorite dismutase, arsenate reductase, V-type ATPase and genes dealing with oxidative stresses. The acquisition and loss of traits at the last common ancestor of arid soil lineages may have facilitated the specialisation of Thaumarchaeota in arid soils. Additionally, the acquisition of unique adaptive traits, such as a urea transporter, Ca2+:H+ antiporter, mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase and phosphatase, DNA end-binding protein Ku and phage shock protein A, further distinguishes arid soil Thaumarchaeota. This study provides evidence for the adaptations of Thaumarchaeota to arid soil, enhancing our understanding of the nitrogen and carbon cycling driven by Thaumarchaeota in drylands.

AB Earlier onset of rigor mortis is a critical physiological progress occurring in the development of pale soft and exudative (PSE) meat. However, how rigor cross -bridges denature under different physiological conditions and their impacts on water -holding capacity remains unclear. To address this scientific question, we firstly established a method to quantify the extent of rigor cross -bridge denaturation using skinned fibres prepared from porcine longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle. Effects of pH and temperature on the kinetics of rigor crossbridge denaturation, actomyosin denaturation and shrinkage of muscle fibre were studied. We then manipulated the number of rigor cross -bridges before the denaturation condition was initiated (pH 5.5, 38 degrees C). Results suggested that the loss of water -holding capacity in PSE meat is determined by the number of denatured rigor cross -bridges. Physiochemical analysis on myofibrils demonstrated that increase in protein oxidation, surface hydrophobicity and loss of electrostatic repulsive force between myofibrils may be involved in the mechanism.

TI Enterococcus faecium inhibits NF-κB/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway to

AB Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can cause intestinal inflammation and diarrhea in yaks, which has a negative impact on their economic value. In recent years, probiotics have gained increasing attention as a pure, natural, nontoxic, harmless, and residue-free additive. However, the underlying mechanisms by which probiotics safeguard against ETEC are not completely elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) against ETEC infection in mice through oral gavage. Morphological changes were examined through light microscopy. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, NF-kappa B, and NLRP3), tight junction protein (ZO-1, Claudin-1), and pyroptosis (Caspase-1, Caspase-4, and gasdermin D (GSDMD)) were detected using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. The results indicate that ETEC infection triggers the activation of inflammation-related pathways (NF-KB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the expression of a large number of inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the activation of NLRP3 leads to the release of GSDMD activation through Caspase-1, ultimately resulting in inflammatory injury and pyroptosis. Feeding mice E. faecium early resulted in an increase in the expression of tight junction protein, a reduction in inflammatory cytokines, and alleviation of inflammatory injury and pyroptosis in intestinal tissues. Our research indicates that E. faecium has the ability to antagonize ETEC and provide protection to the gastrointestinal mucosa in mice.

AB A comb spectrum generator based on the substrate integrated suspension line (SISL) is presented. The circuit is placed in an air cavity formed by the stacking of multilayer substrates. The spectrum generator has good structural stability, self-packaging, high electromagnetic shielding, and a small footprint. Moreover, it can achieve high efficiency and rich harmonic signals output from the L- to K -band. The measured results demonstrate that the power of the 18th harmonic signal of the comb spectrum generator is higher than -32 dBm under the input fundamental frequency range from 500 MHz to 1 GHz at 2 dBm.

AB The ruminants, as the main group of livestock, have been extensively studied in terms of their physiology, endocrinology, biochemistry, genetics, and nutrition. Despite the wide geographic distribution and habitat diversity of animals in this group, their ecology and evolution remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the gene copy number, selection, and ecological and evolutionary processes that have affected the evolution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes across ruminant lineages based on available genomic data. The 51 species analyzed represented all six families of ruminants. Our finding indicated that the architecture of the MHC region is conserved in ruminants, but with variable copy numbers of MHC-I, MHC-IIA, and MHC-IIB genes. No lineage-specific gene duplication was observed in the MHC genes. The phylogenetic generalized least squares regression (PGLS) model revealed association between ecological and biological factors (habitat and lifespan) and gene duplication in DQA and DQB, but not in DRB. The selection pressure of DQA and DQB were related with lifespan, diet, and the ratio of genetic repeat elements. These results suggest that the MHC evolution in ruminants, including copy number and selection, has been influenced by genetic repeat elements, pathogen exposure risk, and intrinsic cost of possessing multiple MHC genes.

AB Millettia speciosa Champ. (MSCP) enjoys widespread recognition for its culinary and medicinal attributes. Despite the extensive history of MSCP cultivation, the disparities in quality and bioactivity between wild and cultivated varieties have remained unexplored. In this study, 20 wild and cultivated MSCP samples were collected from different regions in China. We embarked on a comprehensive investigation of the chemical constituents found in both wild and cultivated MSCP utilizing UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS technology and multivariate analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). In total, 62 chemical components were unequivocally identified or tentatively characterized. Via the multivariate statistical analysis, we successfully pinpointed nine compounds with the potential to serve as chemical markers, enabling the differentiation between wild and cultivated MSCP varieties. Moreover, both genotypes exhibited substantial antioxidant and anti-fatigue properties. The bioactivities of wild MSCP were marginally higher when compared to their cultivated counterparts. This study illuminates the impressive antioxidant and anti-fatigue potential present in both wild and cultivated MSCP genotypes, further augmenting the allure of this species and opening new avenues for the economic valorization of MSCP. Hence, this study provides a valuable method for the identification and quality control of MSCP and a method in chemistry and pharmacology to assess an alternative possibility for cultivated MSCP.

AB In mega -constellation Communication Systems, efficient routing algorithms and data transmission technologies are employed to ensure fast and reliable data transfer. However, the limited computational resources of satellites necessitate the use of edge computing to enhance secure communication. While edge computing reduces the burden on cloud computing, it introduces security and reliability challenges in open satellite communication channels. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain architecture specifically designed for edge computing in mega -constellation communication systems. This architecture narrows down the consensus scope of the blockchain to meet the requirements of edge computing while ensuring comprehensive log storage across the network. Additionally, we introduce a reputation management mechanism for nodes within the blockchain, evaluating their trustworthiness, workload, and efficiency. Nodes with higher reputation scores are selected to participate in tasks and are appropriately incentivized. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a task result reliability of 95% while improving computational speed.

AB The use of taste agents to regulate the grazing behavior of livestock is a new attempt in pasture management, but the effects on grassland plant communities are not clear at present. Therefore, the following scientific questions need to be addressed: (1) how do different taste agents affected plant community structure by changing feed intake? (2) What was the mechanism of this effect? We proposed the following hypotheses: (1) Salt and sweetener increased feed intake of livestock and decreased the biomass of plant community, while bitters did the opposite. (2) Taste agents can regulate the relationship between plant species, and different taste agents can enhance or weaken the competitiveness of the different plants. In order to test the hypothesis, a grazing experiment with yaks was conducted in the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau. Denatonium benzoate (Bitterant), NaCl (Salt), and sodium cyclamate (Sweetener) were sprayed onto the meadows twice a year, along with a control treatment of tap water. The results showed that (1) Salt increased the feed intake of yak significantly; bitterant decreased the feed intake of livestock and increased the biomass of plant community. (2) Salt increased the Pielou index of the plant community significantly. (3) The stability of plant community ranking from high to low is as follows: Control > Bitterant > Sweetener > Salt. (4) Bitterant and salt improved grazing tolerance of grassland and salt reduced the edibility of grassland. (5) The use of taste agents reduced the correlation between dominant species and led to the fragmentation of the relationship chain. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for using taste agents to regulate the community, species biodiversity management, restoration of degraded grassland, promoting utilization of grassland though controlling livestock selectivity.

AB Rhizopus arrhizus is a fungus that can cause central nervous system infections in animals, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, but the mechanism of injury is rarely reported. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Rhizopus arrhizus damage to the central nervous system of mice by observing the clinical neurological symptoms and resolving the pathological changes in the ultrastructure of brain tissues, combined with the alteration of apoptosis-related genes and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed that all the mice in the treated group died, the brain pyknosis of neurons, there were black mycelium aggregates around the blood vessels, and apoptotic vesicles were produced. The RT-qPCR results showed that, compared with the control group, the relative transcriptome levels of Caspase 8 and BcL-2 genes were significantly increased (P < 0.05), the relative transcriptome level of Caspase 9 gene was highly significant (P < 0.01), the relative transcriptome level of Caspase 3 and Bax gene was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the brains of the treated group. TUNEL staining showed that the rate of neuronal apoptosis in the treated group of mice was extremely significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). This study shows that Rhizopus arrhizus strain XMLO1 causes brain damage by triggering neuronal apoptosis. This study provided a theoretical basis for revealing the mechanism of Rhizopus arrhizus infection.

AB The design of Junction Termination Extension (JTE) is an important step for meeting the reliability requirement of SiC PiN diode radiation detectors. For early evaluation, Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) software is often used to simulate the electronic property of detectors with different JTE parameters. But it is time consuming, which need 1 h or even longer for one case. Here, a TCAD augmented Machine Learning (ML) method based on the fully connected Neural Network (NN) algorithm is proposed to predict the breakdown performance quickly with different parameters of Spatial Modulation (SM) JTE. Utilized similar to 5000 datum generated by TCAD simulation, the ML model could be established and achieve good prediction of breakdown voltage and location within a few seconds. As a semi-supervised learning model, its prediction accuracy of breakdown location is higher than 89.4 % and the determination coefficient R-2 of breakdown voltage could be up to 0.97 compared with TCAD simulations. Moreover, this model could give the relationship curve of breakdown voltages and doping concentration, which is useful to choose an ideal structure with a wide implantation dose window. Based on this ML prediction model, the design cycle of SiC PiN diode radiation detectors could be reduced significantly.

AB Objective :To compare the diagnostic performance of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in breast cancer. Methods: Published studies were collected by systematically searching the databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. The sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were confirmed. The symmetric receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC) was used to assess the threshold of ABUS and CEUS. Fagan's nomogram was drawn. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were applied to search for sources of heterogeneity among the included studies. Results: A total of 16 studies were included, comprising 4115 participants. The combined sensitivity of ABUS was 0.88 [95% CI (0.73-0.95)], specificity was 0.93 [95% CI (0.82-0.97)], area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.96 [95% CI (0.94-0.96)] and DOR was 89. The combined sensitivity of CEUS was 0.88 [95% CI (0.84-0.91)], specificity was 0.76 [95% CI (0.66-0.84)], AUC was 0.89 [95% CI (0.86-0.92)] and DOR was 24. The Deeks' funnel plot showed no existing publication bias. The prospective design, partial verification bias and blinding contributed to the heterogeneity in specificity, while no sources contributed to the heterogeneity in sensitivity. The post-test probability of ABUS in BC was 75%, and the post-test probability of CEUS in breast cancer was 48%. Conclusion: Compared with CEUS, ABUS showed higher specificity and DOR for detecting breast cancer. ABUS is expected to further improve the accuracy of BC diagnosis.

DT Article
AB Photo-responsive nanoporous polymer films (AZOF-R(NC6)) have been developed by a template method based on a hydrogen-bonding supramolecular liquid crystal (LC) and a light-sensitive azobenzene LC crosslinker in this work. Anionic nanopores were obtained after the removal of template NC6 using KOH solution. The AZOF-R(NC6) demonstrates charge-selective dye adsorption and the maximum adsorption capacity for Rh6G is 504.6 mg g-1. The AZOF-R(NC6) film without UV light treatment shows a 32% higher adsorption capacity for Rh6G than the AZOF-R(NC6) film treated with UV light within the initial 10 min. In addition, UV light can trigger the release of the adsorbed dye from the polymer film due to the pore size change arising from the trans-cis isomerization. Besides, the used polymer film can be effectively regenerated using a HCl solution. Such functional polymer films with highly ordered nanopores and photo-responsive properties hold great promise in selective adsorption and mass separations.
   A photo-responsive nanoporous polymer film (AZOF-R(NC6)) has been fabricated. AZOF-R(NC6) shows charge-selective and light-responsive dye adsorption.

AB Let a, b, c, and n be positive integers such that a + b = c(2), 2 <does not divide> c and n > 1. In this paper, we prove that if gcd(c, n) = 1 and n >= 117.14c, then the equation (an(2) + 1)(x) + (bn(2) - 1)(y) = (cn)(z) has only the positive integer solution (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 2) under the assumption gcd(an(2) + 1, bn(2) - 1) = 1. Thus, we affirm that the conjecture proposed by Fujita and Le is true in this case. Moreover, combining the above result with some existing results and a computer search, we show that, for any positive integer n, if (a, b, c) = (12, 13, 5), (18, 7, 5), or (44, 5, 7), then this equation has only the solution (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 2). This result extends the theorem of Terai and Hibino gotten in 2015, that of Alan obtained in 2018, and Hasanalizade's theorem attained recently.

AB Allenamides are special allenes, and the unique reactivity, selectivity (both stereoselective and regionally selective) and stability of allenamides have been widely studied. In this review, the development of the free radical transformation of allenamides over the last few years will be summarized. This review discusses in detail in three parts: intermolecular radical addition to C- X (X = N, S, O, Se) bonds, metal salt mediated cyclization of allenamides, and photocatalytic cyclization of allenamides. In addition, reasonable details of the mechanisms are provided for the vast majority of these transformations.

AB The quality of lamb meat is positively correlated with intramuscular fat content. In recent years, a large number of studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of miR-92a-3p on the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes. The results showed that the expression level of miR-92a-3p was low in the early stage of differentiation, reached the highest level on the third day of differentiation, and then decreased. And miR-92a-3p can inhibit the accumulation of lipid droplets and down-regulate the determinants of adipogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, by predicting target genes, we found that miR-92a-3p affects the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes and the accumulation of lipid droplets by regulating the expression of goat gene APOL6. This study provides important new information to better understand the relationship between miRNAs and the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes, thus providing a new reference for goat intramuscular adipogenesis.

AB Birds, a fascinating and diverse group occupying various habitats worldwide, exhibit a wide range of life-history traits, reproductive methods, and migratory behaviors, all of which influence their immune systems. The association between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and certain ecological factors in response to pathogen selection has been extensively studied; however, the role of the co-working molecule T cell receptor (TCR) remains poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze the copy numbers of TCR-V genes, the selection pressure (omega value) on MHC genes using available genomic data, and their potential ecological correlates across 93 species from 13 orders. The study was conducted using the publicly available genome data of birds. Our findings suggested that phylogeny influences the variability in TCR-V gene copy numbers and MHC selection pressure. The phylogenetic generalized least squares regression model revealed that TCR-V alpha delta copy number and MHC-I selection pressure were positively associated with body mass. Clutch size was correlated with MHC selection pressure, and Migration was correlated with TCR-V beta copy number. Further analyses revealed that the TCR-V beta copy number was positively correlated with MHC-IIB selection pressure, while the TCR-V gamma copy number was negatively correlated with MHC-I peptide-binding region selection pressure. Our findings suggest that TCR-V diversity is significant in adaptive evolution and is related to species' life-history strategies and immunological defenses and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying TCR-V gene duplication and MHC selection in avian species.

AB This study aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health literacy (MHL) and workplace well-being (WWB) of Chinese grassroots civil servants, with regulatory emotional self-efficacy fi cacy (RESE) and resilience as mediating variables. A questionnaire survey was conducted among Chinese grassroots civil servants, with a valid sample size of 2673 after excluding missing values and conducting relevant data processing. The PROCESS was used to examine the relationship between MHL, RESE, resilience, and WWB. The study found that MHL among grassroots civil servants was positively and significantly fi cantly correlated with WWB (r = 0.73, p < 0.01). RESE partially mediated the relationship between MHL and WWB (/3 /3 = 0.25, 95% CI [0.22, 0.28]). Resilience partially mediated the relationship between MHL and WWB (/3 /3 = 0.22, 95% CI [0.19, 0.26]). MHL had a positive effect on WWB through the chain mediating effect of RESE and resilience (/3 /3 = 0.05, 95% CI [0.03, 0.07]). There is a close relationship between MHL and WWB, where Chinese grassroots civil servants with higher levels of MHL can develop stronger RESE and resilience, leading to higher WWB. The results of this study remind organizational institutions of Chinese grassroots civil servants that enhancing MHL, RESE, and resilience is an important pathway to promoting their WWB.

AB N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is an essential biomarker for the prediction of heart failure (HF), but its prognostic ability across body mass index (BMI) categories needs to be clarified. Our study aimed to explore the association between BMI and NT-proBNP and assess the effect of BMI on the prognostic ability of NT-proBNP in Chinese patients with HF. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from the FuWai Hospital HF Center in Beijing, China. According to the Chinese adult BMI standard, 1,508 patients with HF were classified into four groups: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)), normal weight (BMI 18.5-23.9 kg/m(2), as a reference category), overweight (BMI 24-27.9 kg/m(2)), and obesity (BMI >= 28 kg/m(2)). NT-proBNP was examined for its prognostic role in adverse events as an endpoint. BMI was independently and negatively associated with NT-proBNP (beta = -0.074; P < 0.001), and NT-proBNP levels tended to decrease as BMI increased across the different BMI categories. The results of our study differ from those of other studies of European-American populations. In this study, NT-proBNP was a weak predictor of a 4-year adverse prognosis in underweight patients (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)). In other BMI categories, NT-proBNP was an independent predictor of adverse events in HF. BMI and sex significantly affected the optimal threshold for NT-proBNP to predict the risk of adverse events. There is a negative correlation between BMI and NT-proBNP, and NT-proBNP independently predicts adverse HF events in patients with a BMI of >= 18.5 kg/m(2). The optimal risk prediction cutoffs are lower in patients who are overweight and obese.

AB Achieving a balance between spectral resolution and spatial resolution in multi-spectral remote sensing images is challenging due to physical constraints. Consequently, pan-sharpening technology was developed to address this challenge. While significant progress was recently achieved in deep-learning-based pan-sharpening techniques, most existing deep learning approaches face two primary limitations: (1) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle with long-range dependency issues, and (2) significant detail loss during deep network training. Moreover, despite these methods' pan-sharpening capabilities, their generalization to full-sized raw images remains problematic due to scaling disparities, rendering them less practical. To tackle these issues, we introduce in this study a multi-spectral remote sensing image fusion network, termed TAMINet, which leverages a two-stream coordinate attention mechanism and multi-detail injection. Initially, a two-stream feature extractor augmented with the coordinate attention (CA) block is employed to derive modal-specific features from low-resolution multi-spectral (LRMS) images and panchromatic (PAN) images. This is followed by feature-domain fusion and pan-sharpening image reconstruction. Crucially, a multi-detail injection approach is incorporated during fusion and reconstruction, ensuring the reintroduction of details lost earlier in the process, which minimizes high-frequency detail loss. Finally, a novel hybrid loss function is proposed that incorporates spatial loss, spectral loss, and an additional loss component to enhance performance. The proposed methodology's effectiveness was validated through experiments on WorldView-2 satellite images, IKONOS, and QuickBird, benchmarked against current state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental findings reveal that TAMINet significantly elevates the pan-sharpening performance for large-scale images, underscoring its potential to enhance multi-spectral remote sensing image quality.

AB Mycoplasma synoviae, which causes the disease known as chicken synovitis, causes serious immunosuppression. We developed a rapid insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) assay for on -site detection of M. synoviae using a primer and probe set targeting the variable lipoprotein and haemagglutinin (vlhA) gene. In addition, the specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and clinical detection of this method were evaluated. Our iiPCR assay detected M. synoviae clinical isolates and samples successfully and produced negative results on Mycoplasma galliscepticum, avian viral arthritis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium, indicating that the PCR reactions were specific. Additionally, our iiPCR assay detected the prepared positive standard plasmid diluted 10 times (1.00 x 10-1 - 1.00 x 10-10) as a template. The undiluted positive plasmid was positive and double distilled water was negative indicating that the PCR reactions were sensitive, respectively. Finally, the vlhA positive standard plasmid with dilution multiple of 1.00 x 10-4 - 1.00 x 10-6 was repeatedly detected three times to evaluate the repeatability of the iiPCR method established in this experiment showing that the iiPCR of M. synoviae is repeatable. The established iiPCR was also used to detect 50 chicken joint enlargement samples. The thermostatic detection PCR established in this experiment was comparable to a reference real-time PCR (qPCR).

AB Online reviews play a pivotal role in shaping consumer decisions on e-commerce platforms and social media. Ensuring the authenticity and effectiveness of these reviews is essential for safeguarding consumer rights and preserving platform integrity. Nevertheless, Chinese online reviews pose unique challenges due to their linguistic complexity and the scarcity of annotated data, rendering the efficient identification of fake reviews a persistent challenge.To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel pre-training model called SGAN-SAM-ERNIE, which integrates a self-attention mechanism within a semi-supervised framework. Initially, the ERNIE3.0 pre-training model is utilized to extract high-quality language representations from online review data. Subsequently, the generator within the semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN) generates synthetic data that mimics the distribution of authentic reviews. Meanwhile, the self-attention mechanism is integrated to capture key information and semantic dependencies within the input sequences, thereby enhancing the model's comprehension of the reviews. Finally, a discriminator is employed to distinguish between authentic and fake reviews. Experimental validation was conducted using both cross-lingual and Chinese-specific datasets. The results demonstrate a notable improvement in fake review identification performance, even in scenarios with limited labeled data availability. This underscores the efficacy of the proposed SGAN-SAM-ERNIE model in addressing the challenges associated with identifying fake reviews in Chinese, thereby contributing to a more trustworthy and reliable online review ecosystem.

AB Cattleyak is a typically male sterile species. The meiosis process is blocked and the scarcity of spermatogenic stems cells are both contributing factors to the inability of male cattleyak to produce sperm. While Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is the first discovered growth factor known to promote the proliferation and self-renewal of spermatogenic stem cells, its relationship to the spermatogenesis arrest of cattleyak remains unclear. In this report, we studied the differential expression of GDNF in the testis of yak and cattleyak, and discussed the optimal concentration of GDNF in the culture medium of undifferentiated spermatogonia (UDSPG) of cattleyak in vitro and the effect of GDNF on the proliferation of cattleyak UDSPG. The results indicated that GDNF expression in the testicular tissue of cattleyak was inferior to that of yak. Moreover, the optimum value for the UDSPG in vitro culture was determined to be 20-30 ng/mL for cattleyak. In vitro, the proliferation activity of UDSPG was observed to increase with additional GDNF due to the up-regulation of proliferation-related genes and the down-regulation of differentiation-related genes. We hereby report that the scarcity of cattleyak UDSPG is due to insufficient expression of GDNF, and that the addition of GDNF in vitro can promote the proliferation of cattleyak UDSPG by regulating the expression of genes related to proliferation and differentiation. This work provides a new insight to solve the issue of spermatogenic arrest in cattleyak.

AB In the field of electronic communication warfare, accurately predicting the range and intensity of shortwave interference signals presents a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between the ionospheric parameters and the electromagnetic environment. To address this challenge, we designed a novel tool to assess the interference impact area of shortwave interference signals in a dynamically changing ionospheric environment. Considering sophisticated ionospheric radio wave propagation models and innovative spatial grid methods, this tool finishes the comprehensive spatial distribution of the interference impact area and delivers grid-based insights into the interference intensity. Furthermore, the test verification of the tool demonstrated a mean error of 8.42 dB between the measured and simulated results, underscoring the efficacy and reliability of this tool. This pioneering work is poised to make substantial contributions to the field of communication electronic warfare and holds significant promise for guiding the development of interference countermeasures.

We prove Wazwaz's proposal that the KdV-nKdV equation has continuous periodic wave solutions and give their exact expressions by elliptic integral theory. We confirm that the KdVnKdV equation has no classical solitary wave solution although it can be regarded as a fusion of the KdV equation with classical solitary wave and the nKdV equation. In addition, we obtain some novel traveling wave solutions of it including trapezoidal wave, inverted 'N' wave, and blow-up wave solutions.

AB In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to solve the (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear dispersive long wave equation. Using it, we study the data-driven solitary wave solutions, periodic wave solutions, kink wave solutions and various multiple soliton solutions for the equations with initial-boundary value conditions. On the one hand, we obtain the data-driven traveling wave solutions of the equations, which have high accuracy compared with corresponding exact traveling wave solutions. On the other hand, we set more complicated initial-boundary value problems of the equations, whose exact traveling wave solution cannot be easy to obtain, but our network still works well and gives its numerical solution. The results show that our deep learning algorithm is able to accurately capture the dynamical behavior of traveling waves of the (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear dispersive long wave equation.

AB Urea, as a feed additive, causes poisoning in excessive dosage. In this study, we explored the mechanism of lung damage in urea poisoning on Jianzhou Da'er goat by adding different levels of urea. We used pathological histological analysis and Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR to investigate the extent of lung damage. 9 Jianzhou Da'er goats of similar age and body condition were selected and equally randomized into three groups: 0 % urea group with 0 urea diet, 5 % urea group with 5 % urea diet and 10 % urea group with 10 % urea diet. Equal feeding was used 3 times daily (8:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m.) in 7-d pre-feeding stage and 21-d formal experiment. After the experiment, we found the lungs of 5 % urea group and 10 % urea group both had collagen fibrosis proliferation and hemosiderin production. The nuclei of alveolar epithelial cells in the 5 % urea group were constricted and the mitochondria swelled; the alveolar epithelial cells in the 10 % urea group were necrotic and disintegrated. The expressions of RIP3 (Receptor interacting protein kinase 3) and TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) mRNA in the lung of the 5 % urea group and 10 % urea group were increased significantly (P < 0.01) while the mRNA expressions of cIAP2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2) and TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain) in the 10 % urea group were significantly decreased (P < 0.01); the mRNA expression of NEMO (NF-kappa B essential modulator) and Caspase-8 (cysteine aspartate protease-8) in lung of the 5 % urea group and 10 % urea group were significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and the mRNA expression of HMBG-1 (High mobility group box-1) and HSP70(Heat Shock Protein 70) were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01). The expression of RIP3 protein in 5 % urea group and 10 % urea group were increased significantly (P < 0.01). In summary, evidence of lung damage from urea feeding includes disruption of alveolar structure, lysis of organelles, and a significant rise in genes associated with necroptosis. We expect to provide scientific value for the study of necroptosis and lung injury caused by urea toxicity.

Six RCTs involving 1912 patients were included. The pooled analysis provided evidence that veliparib-containing regimens could significantly improve the PFS (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61-0.83; p < 0.0001), OS (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76-0.99; p = 0.03), and ORR (RR: 1.52; 95% CI:1.06-2.18; p = 0.02) than those of controls for treating advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Breast cancer patients with BRCA-mutation tended to have a better PFS than the BRCA-wildtype group, and patients with TNBC tended to associated with a longer PFS than the non-TNBC group. Veliparib could significantly increase the risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Anemia and neutropenia should be well concerned. The veliparib-containing regimen was efficacious in treating advanced/metastatic breast cancer with a controllable safety factor.

AB To investigate suitable processing methods for improve the flavor while maintaining quality, hellgrammites were subjected to fifteen different processing methods. The samples were tested by sensory evaluation and were analyzed using HS-SPME-GC-MS. The sensory evaluation revealed that five methods for head and chest removal, three wine-fried methods, and three vinegar-roasting methods significantly reduced the levels of hexanal (3129.05 +/- 45.77 mu g/kg) and heptanal (436.72 +/- 7.42 mu g/kg), compounds responsible for fishy and earthy flavors, compared to raw samples. The latter two methods exhibited increased aroma flavor. PCA and OPLS-DA analyses suggested that acids, alcohols, and esters played a crucial role in flavor modification. Notably, vinegar-roasting methods demonstrated the highest acid content and had a substantial impact on volatile compounds. Additionally, boiling methods effectively reduced the levels of hazardous compounds, such as toluene and 1,3-Dimethyl-benzene. However, other methods did not exhibit similar efficacy in reducing hazardous compounds. The accumulation of hazardous compounds showed a decreasing trend in the whole insect, head removal, and head and chest removal groups. Moreover, the relative odor activity value consistently identified aldehyde compounds, including hexanal and heptanal, as the main contributors to aroma. Overall, boiling and head and chest removal procedures were suggested as precautionary measures during the initial processing of hellgrammites-based food products. The vinegar-roasting and wine-fried methods could be employed to impart desired flavors, aligning with consumers' preferences. These findings lay the foundation for standardizing processing techniques and ensuring the quality control of products derived from hellgrammites.

AB The shape coefficient of building (SCB) characterizes the correlation between building shape and building energy consumption. Strictly restricting the SCB was harmful to reducing energy consumption, neglecting the potential benefits of solar radiation. A novel concept and determining method of modified shape coefficient of building (MSCB) were proposed based on the energy dissipating and solar heat gain. Field measurements of the indoor air temperature of model buildings for solar radiation, building orientations, and U-values under natural and heating conditions were conducted in western Sichuan. Results demonstrated that with identical SCB, the indoor thermal environment was substantially affected by the above parameters, proving the one-sidedness of SCB simultaneously. A simulation method verified via the experiments was employed to forecast the dynamic heating load of a real building. The influence of building orientations on the MSCB under actual climatic conditions from different time scales was discussed. Results illustrated that the SCB could be reduced by 34.6% in the present case. The monthly correction factor trend and the heat consumption were consistent. The restriction on SCB could be liberalized moderately even if the heating demand was tremendous. This research could provide a reference for the energy-saving design of passive buildings.

AB Chinese calligraphic handwriting (CCH) practice has proven to be beneficial to several aspects of psychological health and has been considered a complementary therapy for mental disorders. However, less is known about whether CCH practice benefits an individual's positive affect, a core component of affective well-being. Therefore, we examined this question in Chinese adolescents by combining correlational and experimental methods. In Study 1 (N = 1460), we found that high school students who practiced CCH had higher positive affect in their daily lives than those who did not practice CCH. In Study 2, a training experiment was conducted with college students, who were randomly assigned to receive either CCH training or no treatment. A six-day short-term CCH training led to a significant benefit in positive affect in the training group (N = 23) relative to the control group (N = 27). Together, our study provides converging evidence that CCH practice can promote positive affect in adolescents, further supporting the promotion of CCH in mental health practice.

AB Following the historic destruction of China's forests, large protected forest landscapes have been reestablishment across the country in recent decades. Currently, the species assemblages inhabiting these landscapes remain widely unknown. Here, we aim to establish whether the new temperate forest landscapes in Eastern China, composed of plantation, secondary and remnant mature forest patches, are dominated by widely distributed habitat generalists, widely distributed habitat specialists, or by sets of highly localized forest habitat specialist species, using vascular plants and ground beetles as case studies. We sampled plants and ground beetles on 159 plots representing different forest types distributed across ten study regions. The Chord-normalized expected species shared (CNESS) dissimilarity for beetles and Jaccard dissimilarity for plants were calculated to establish species' turnover patterns, while we used structural equation and multiple regression models for dissimilarity matrices to establish the relative importance of location, elevation and biotic interactions in explaining largescale distribution patterns of species assemblages. Both taxa showed highly regionalized recruitment, with plant communities responding strongly to latitude, and to geographic location in general, while the composition of ground beetle communities appeared strongly governed by both the composition of the vegetation and study plot location. Both assemblages showed a distinct lack of widespread habitat generalists. Our results demonstrate for the first time that local assemblages of forest specialist species appear to have survived last century's deforestation in unknown refugia before successfully re-colonizing China's restored forest ecosystems. We argue that restored forest landscapes can play a significant role in the conservation of temperate China's biodiversity at both local and regional scales.

AB Background Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is a highly contagious pathogen that strongly influences the productivity of small ruminants worldwide. Acetylation is an important post-translational modification involved in regulation of multiple biological functions. However, the extent and function of acetylation in host cells during PPRV infection remains unknown.Methods Dimethylation-labeling-based quantitative proteomic analysis of the acetylome of PPRV-infected Vero cells was performed.Results In total, 1068 proteins with 2641 modification sites were detected in response to PPRV infection, of which 304 differentially acetylated proteins (DAcPs) with 410 acetylated sites were identified (fold change < 0.83 or > 1.2 and P < 0.05), including 109 up-regulated and 195 down-regulated proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) classification indicated that DAcPs were mostly located in the cytoplasm (43%) and participated in cellular and metabolic processes related to binding and catalytic activity. Functional enrichment indicated that the DAcPs were involved in the minichromosome maintenance complex, unfolded protein binding, helicase activity. Only protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway was enriched. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the identified proteins further indicated that a various chaperone and ribosome processes were modulated by acetylation.Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on acetylome in PPRV-infected host cell. Our findings establish an important baseline for future study on the roles of acetylation in the host response to PPRV replication and provide novel insights for understanding the molecular pathological mechanism of PPRV infection.

AB This study aimed to examine the effect of dietary cysteamine on yolk taurine content in hens during different egg production periods. In Exp. 1, China Agricultural University-3 (CAU-3) hens at the peak stage of egg production (aged 31 wks) were used to explore the effect of diets supplemented with 0.1% cysteamine on yolk taurine content, egg quality and production performance. In Exp.2, two breeds of hens (half Hy-Line Brown and half CAU-3 hens) at the late stage of egg production (68 wks) were used to investigate the influence of diets supplemented with 0, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.08% or 0.10% cysteamine on yolk taurine content, egg quality, production performance and ovary development. In Exp.1, diets supplemented with 0.1% cysteamine significantly increased yolk taurine content (p < 0.05) without negative influence on production performance or egg quality. In Exp.2, the highest yolk taurine content was observed when cysteamine was supplemented at 0.08% (p < 0.001). However, supplemental cysteamine linearly or quadratically decreased production performance over the first few weeks of feeding, and the effects disappeared with continued feeding (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study indicated that cysteamine supplementation benefits yolk taurine deposition in hens at both peak and late stage of egg production, but hens at the late stage of egg production show depressed production performance and egg quality.

AB CXCL14 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14) is an important chemokine involved in infection and immunity and plays an important role in a variety of immune-related diseases. The 446 bp cDNA sequence of the CXCL14 gene in yaks was obtained. Additionally, the prokaryotic expression vector of the CXCL14 protein with a molecular weight of 27 kDa was successfully constructed and expressed. The proliferation activities and migration abilities of spleen macrophages were significantly inhibited after treatment with the CXCL14 protein at different concentrations (1, 10 and 20 mu g/mL) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8) and interferon-alpha (TNF-alpha) were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the expression of anti-inflammatory factor interleukin 10 (IL10) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The contents of inflammatory factors in the supernatant of cells were detected using ELISA, and it was also found that the contents of TNF-alpha, IL6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2) were significantly increased under different CXCL14 protein concentrations (p < 0.05). Finally, the exogenous addition of CXCL14 inhibited the activity, clonal formation and migration of hepatoma cells (HepG2). Additionally, after HepG2 cells were treated with 20 mu g/mL CXCL14 protein for 12 h, 24 h and 36 h, the expression levels of BCL2 homologous antagonist/killer (BAK) and the BCL2-associated X apoptosis regulator (BAX) were increased to varying degrees, while the expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) genes decreased compared to the control group. In conclusion, the CXCL14 protein can inhibit the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells by inducing the expression of macrophage pro-inflammatory factors and activating apoptosis-related genes to exert innate immunity. These results are helpful to further study the function of the CXCL14 protein and provide research data for the innate immune mechanism of yaks under harsh plateau environments.

AB This paper addresses an H-infinity control approach on neural networks with hybrid-triggered mechanism (HTM) under deception attacks. With the aim of mitigating the burden of the transmission network, an HTM is introduced to handle unforeseen non-ideal environment influence, which is characterized by Bernoulli distribution. The weight combination coefficients epsilon(j) related to historical information are conducted to develop an improved HTM. By taking into account network-induced delay, and the randomly happened deception attacks in transmission network, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed. Using linear matrix inequality (LMI), sufficient conditions are formed to render the system asymptotically stable and the H-infinity hybrid-triggered controller is designed. Finally, simulation examples are executed to validate the feasibility of the developed method.

AB Continuous integration (CI) is a widely applied development practice to allow frequent integration of software changes, detecting early faults. However, extremely frequent builds consume amounts of time and resources in such a scenario. It is quite challenging for existing test case prioritization (TCP) to address this issue due to the time-consuming information collection (e.g. test coverage) or inaccurately modelling code semantics to result in the unsatisfied prioritization. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware two-phase TCP framework, named SatTCP, which combines the coarse-grained filtering and fine-grained prioritization to perform the precise TCP with low time costs for CI. It consists of three parts: (1) code representation, parsing the programme changes and test cases to obtain the code change and test case representations; (2) coarse-grained filtering, conducting the preliminary ranking and filtering of test cases based on information retrieval; and (3) fine-grained prioritization, training a pretrained Siamese language model based on the filtered test set to further sort the test cases via semantic similarity. We evaluate SatTCP on a large-scale, real-world dataset with cross-project validation from fault detection efficiency and time costs and compare it with five baselines. The results show that SatTCP outperforms all baselines by 6.3%-45.6% for mean average percentage of fault detected per cost (APFDc), representing an obvious upward trend as the project scale increases. Meanwhile, SatTCP can reduce the real CI testing by 71.4%, outperforming the best baseline by 17.2% for time costs on average. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different configurations, flaky tests and hybrid techniques on the performance of SatTCP, respectively.
   semantic-aware two-phase test case prioritization (SatTCP) is a test case prioritization (TCP) framework that combines coarse-grained filtering and fine-grained prioritization to perform the precise TCP with low time costs for continuous integration testing. It first uses information retrieval to filter test cases, then leverages a Siamese language model to precisely rank test cases based on semantic similarity between code changes and test cases.image

ID CONVERGENCE RATE; GRADIENT-METHOD; ALGORITHM; SELECTION
AB In this paper, we consider a class of three-composite nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problems, where one of nonsmooth functions is further composed with linear operator. Based on the variable smoothing method, as well as first-order methods with suitable majorization techniques, we propose a proximal variable smoothing gradient (ProxVSG) method for solving this kind of problem. The ProxVSG can be implemented efficiently, thanks to the fact that at each iteration, one just separately computes the proximal mapping of each nonsmooth function, rather than that of the sum of these nonsmooth functions. Furthermore, within our broad and flexible analysis framework, we propose a new proximal variable smoothing incremental aggregated gradient (ProxVSIAG) generalizations of the ProxVSG. In ProxVSIAG, an incremental aggregated estimate of the gradient is used, instead of the full gradient. Under suitable assumptions, we prove a complexity of O( is an element of (-3)) to achieve an is an element of-approximate solution. Preliminary numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.

ID ALLOYS; TITANIUM; BEHAVIOR
AB Ti50Cu35-XNi15SnX (X = 5,6,7, wt%) Ti-based amorphous composite coatings were prepared on TA1 by atmo-spheric plasma spraying. The phase and microstructure were analysed by X-ray diffractometerand scanning electron microscope. The obtained cross-section image of the titanium-based amorphous composite coating confirmed the successful preparation of the amorphous coating. The phase analysis results indicated that an increase in Sn content resulted in a decrease in the amorphous content of the coating. The electrochemical results revealed a significant improvement in the corrosion resistance of the coating compared to the TA1 substrate, consequently enhancing the service life of the electronic material. When the Sn content was 5 wt%, the minimum current density of the coating reached 8.62 x 10-6 A/cm2 , and the corrosion rate was 16 times lower than that of the TA1 substrate. As the Sn content increased, the current density of the coating increased from 8.62 x 10-6 A/ cm2 to 5.08 x 10-5 A/cm2. Overall, the corrosion resistance of the coating exhibited a downward trend. This observation could be attributed to the decrease in amorphous content caused by the higher Sn content, resulting in a reduction in the corrosion resistance of the coating.

AB Simple Summary The yak is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and serves as an important livestock animal for Tibetan pastoral society. Phenotypic traits vary among domestic yaks. However, genomic characteristics, population structure, and the genetic relationship of domestic yaks with wild yaks have not been effectively characterized until now. In this study, six domestic populations were sequenced, and selective sweep regions involved in yak domestication were detected. Furthermore, divergence time for domestic and wild yaks was estimated. This study revealed new insight into selection for domestic and wild yaks.Abstract The yak (Bos grunniens) was domesticated in the high-altitude QTP. Research about their genetic diversity and population structure is limited. In this study, we resequenced the genome of 494 domestic yaks using Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq). The survey was conducted on six populations sampled from isolated locations in China in order to analyze their structure and genetic diversity. These six domestic populations were clearly grouped into two independent clusters, with Jinchuan, Changtai, and Jiulong showing a tight genetic relationship with the wild yak. Nerve development pathways were enriched with GO enrichment analysis of 334 domesticated genes. Major genomic regions associated with the differentiation of domestic yaks were detected. These findings provide preliminary information on the yak genome variability, useful to understand the genomic characteristics of different populations in QTP.

AB The main aim of the current work was to explore the differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes of longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) between castrated and uncastrated fattening male South Sichuan black goats (Capra hircus). Then, the key genes regulating important differential metabolites (DMs) in castrated male goats were observed by integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses. In addition, we evaluated the effects of castration on blood constituents, dressing percentage, and water holding capacity of LDM in male black goats. The results showed that the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly increased and testosterone was significantly decreased in castrated male goats compared with the uncastrated male goats, while dressing percentage of black goats and water holding capacity of longissimus dorsi muscle were not significant differences. Through metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, 23 important KEGG pathways, 13 important DMs, 32 important differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and 13 key genes related to the "Metabolism" and "Organismal systems" pathways were screened. Lipid accumulation may be elevated in the blood of fattening South Sichuan black goats after castration. Castration might play a positive role in energy provision, intercellular signaling, muscle function, softening of meat, disease reduction, and anti-oxidation of LDM. P4HA2, AKR1B1, GPT2, L2HGDH, ENSCHIG00000021660, ENSCHIG00000023861, DGAT2, ULK1, SLC38A3, PLA2G4A, SLC6A1, ENSCHIG00000026624, and ND2 might be the key genes regulating important DMs in the KEGG pathways related to "Metabolism" and "Organismal systems" of castrated male goats compared with the uncastrated male goats.

Our empirical results demonstrate that tail risk of the international stock market is statistically and economically informative about oil volatility. After controlling for EMV and VIX variables, tail risk of international stock market is still useful for predicting oil volatility. Our results prove that tail risk could provide incremental information for the connection between stock market and oil volatility.

AB Flowering time is central to plant reproductive success and is significantly influenced by the time of floral bud differentiation and development. Pleione species flower in either spring or autumn; however, the mechanisms underlying floral bud differentiation and development are yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the floral bud development of three spring flowering species and three autumn-flowering species using continuous anatomical observations. The renewed shoots grew on the side of the old pseudobulb after the fade of a previous flower, after which a new pseudobulb with 1-3 buds slowly formed at the base of the renewed shoot. For both spring-flowering and autumn-flowering species, the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth occurred in June, and flower differentiation was completed in August. The autumn-flowering species bloomed immediately after the completion of flower bud development, while the spring-flowering species went through six months of dormancy; thus, the time requirement from floral bud initiation to flowering was longer in the spring-flowering species than in the autumn-flowering species (-270 days vs. 90 days, respectively). The dormancy time of the spring-flowering species, rather than the initiation or duration of floral bud development, was the reason for their differing flowering times. Shift of flowering from autumn to spring probably related to the evolution of Pleione from subtropical areas to higher elevations. These findings will be helpful in breeding new varieties and for the regulation of flowering time in horticultural production, and will enhance our understanding of the evolution of flowering time for closely related species.

AB In recent years, the tensor completion algorithm has played a vital part in the reconstruction of missing elements within high-dimensional remote sensing image data. Due to the difficulty of tensor rank computation, scholars have proposed many substitutions of tensor rank. By introducing the smooth rank function (SRF), this paper proposes a new tensor rank nonconvex substitution function that performs adaptive weighting on different singular values to avoid the performance deficiency caused by the equal treatment of all singular values. On this basis, a novel tensor completion model that minimizes the SRF as the objective function is proposed. The proposed model is efficiently solved by adding the hot start method to the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) framework. Extensive experiments are carried out in this paper to demonstrate the resilience of the proposed model to missing data. The results illustrate that the proposed model is superior to other advanced models in tensor completeness.

AB This paper focuses on the influence of road weight captured by vibration on vibratory vibrator energy excitation and the optimization of vibratory vibrator baseplate when there is road instead of direct contact between baseplate and the ground. For this purpose, based on the vibration attenuation formula of the foundation surface, the variation law of the captured road weight is obtained. The excitation dynamics model considering the captured road weight is constructed and verified. The energy excitation effect of vibration system is analyzed. By using topology optimization method, the baseplate is optimized, and the comparative study of vibratory vibrator excitation effect before and after optimization is carried out. In the process of energy transmission of the vibrator, the reaction mass will consume most of the energy, the actual output vibratory wave energy is only 5.5% of the total energy. The octagonal I-steel baseplate can reduce its weight by 442 kg while ensuring its rigidity, and the energy excitation effect is relatively improved by 18.2%. The research will provide a reference for improving the energy excitation effect of vibratory vibrator considering the weight of the captured road.

AB Climate change is a major driver of cyclical and seasonal changes in alpine phenology. This study investigated how climate change affects vegetation phenology's spatial and temporal responses on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) from 1981 to 2020. We used the daily two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) at a 0.05 & DEG; spatial resolution for 1981-2014, 16-day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index data for 2000-2020 at 250 m spatial resolution, and climate records from 106 meteorological stations from 1981 to 2020 to construct linear regression models and Mann-Kendall point test to understand the changes on QTP vegetation in response to climate change. We found that the temperature in April, July, and September controls vegetation growth, and spring precipitation (p < 0.05) influences the length of the growing period, with a partial correlation coefficient of -0.69. Over the past 40 years, temperature and precipitation changes on the QTP have not shown abrupt shifts despite the increasingly warm and dry spring climate. We observed a meridional distribution trend in the correlation between precipitation and alpine vegetation greening, browning and the length of the growing period. In regions experiencing strong warming, vegetation growth was hindered by a lack of precipitation. We conclude that climatic factors alone cannot fully explain the changing trends in vegetation phenology across the QTP.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens fsznc-06 and Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 on the expressions of spleen genes in weanling Jintang black goats. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens fsznc-06 (BA-treated group) and Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 (BP-treated group) were directly fed to goats, and the spleens were harvested for transcriptome analysis. The KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BA-treated vs CON group were mainly involved in digestive system and immune system, while those in BP-treated vs CON group were mainly involved in immune system, and those in BA-treated vs BP-treated group were mainly involved in digestive system. In conclusion, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens fsznc-06 might promote the expressions of genes related to immune system and digestive system, reduce the expressions of disease genes related to digestive system and might promote mutual accommodation of some immune genes in weanling black goat. Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 might promote the expressions of genes related to immune system and mutual accommodation of some immune genes in weanling black goat. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens fsznc-06 has advantages over Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 in promoting the expressions of genes related to digestive system and mutual accommodation of some immune genes.

AB The presence or absence of subcutaneous adipose accumulation will affect the energy storage, insulation resistance and metabolism of animals. Proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes play a significant role in lipid deposition. The objective of this study was to clone the goat CXCL17 gene and investigate its potential functions on goat subcutaneous preadipocytes' proliferation by gaining or losing function in vitro. The goat CXCL17 gene was cloned by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and bioinformatics analysis was performed. The expression of the CXCL17 gene in the different goat tissues and adipocytes at different differentiation stages was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results showed that the cloned sequence of goat CXCL17 gene is 728 bp and the CDS region is 357 bp, encoding 118 amino acids. CXCL17 protein is located in nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria and extracellular matrix. Tissue-expression profiles revealed that CXCL17 expressed in all of the examined tissues. In visceral tissues, the highest expression level was found in lung (p < 0.01); in muscle tissues, the highest CXCL17 expression level was found in the longissimus dorsi (p < 0.01) and in adipose tissues, the highest expression level was found in subcutaneous adipose (p <0.01). Compared with those cells before differentiation, CXCL17 expression levels upregulated at 48 h (p < 0.01), 72 h (p < 0.01), 120 h (p < 0.01) and downregulated at 96 h (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the results of crystal violet staining and semi-quantitative assay showed that transfection with 1 mu g CXCL17 expression plasmid reduced the cell numbers in vitro. Meanwhile, the expression of CCND1 was significantly decreased. A similar consequence happened after interfering with CXCL17 expression. However, plasmid transfected with 2 mu g pEGFPN1-CXCL17 increased the number of cells in vitro. These results suggest that CXCL17 is involved in the proliferation of goat subcutaneous preadipocytes.

AB To understand the influence of doping Sr atoms on the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of the infinite-layer NdSrNiO2, we carried out the screened hybrid density functional study on the Nd9-nSrnNi9O18 (n = 0-2) unit cells. Geometries, substitution energies, magnetic moments, spin densities, atom- and lm-projected partial density of states (PDOS), spin-polarized band structures, and the average Bader charges were studied. It showed that the total magnetic moments of the Nd9Ni9O18 and Nd8SrNi9O18 unit cells are 37.4 and 24.9 emu g(-1), respectively. They are decreased to 12.6 and 4.2 emu g(-1) for the Nd7Sr2Ni9O18-Dia and Nd7Sr2Ni9O18-Par unit cells. The spin density distributions demonstrated that magnetic disordering of the Ni atoms results in the magnetism decrease. The spin-polarized band structures indicated that the symmetry of the spin-up and spin-down energy bands around the Fermi levels also influence the total magnetic moments. Atom- and lm-projected PDOS as well as the band structures revealed that Ni(dx2-y2) is the main orbital intersecting the Fermi level. As a whole, electrons of Sr atoms tend to locate locally and hybridize weakly with the O atoms. They primarily help to build the infinite-layer structures, and influence the electronic structure near the Fermi level indirectly.

AB This article is concerned with the practical stability performance of nonlinear impulsive stochastic functional differential systems driven by G-Brownian motion (G-ISFDSs). Comparing with traditional Lyapunov stability theory, practical stability can portray qualitative behaviour and quantitative properties of suggested systems. By employing G-Ito formula, Lyapunov-Razumikhin approach and stochastic analysis theory, some novel conditions for pth moment practical exponential stability and quasi-sure global practical uniform exponential stability of G-ISFDSs are established. The obtained results show that impulses may influence dynamic behaviour of the addressed system. Two numerical examples are given to verify the validity of our developed results.

AB Cuproptosis is a newfound cell death form that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells. Studies on the relationship have covered most common cancer types and analyzed the links between cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) and various aspects of tumor characteristics. In this study, we evaluated the role of cuproptosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and constructed the cuproptosis-related score (CuS) to predict aggressiveness and prognosis in LUAD, so as to achieve precise treatment for patients. CuS had a better predictive performance than cuproptosis genes, possibly due to the synergy of SLC family genes, and patients with a high CuS had a poor prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the correlation between CuS and immune and mitochondrial pathways in multiple datasets. Furthermore, we predicted six potential drugs targeting high-CuS patients, including AZD3759, which is a targeted drug for LUAD. In conclusion, cuproptosis is involved in LUAD aggressiveness, and CuS can accurately predict the prognosis of patients. These findings provide a basis for precise treatment of patients with high CuS in LUAD.

AB IntroductionThe study examines the impact of stereotype threat on generationally poor individuals and its effect on achievement motivation. It also explores the extent to which self-affirmation has an intervention effect on the negative impact of stereotype threat. Methods and resultsIn Study 1, statements that contained negative stereotypes were used to elicit stereotype threat in generationally poor individuals; the results show that stereotype threat reduced the performance of generationally poor individuals in a mental-rotation task. Study 2 used a questionnaire to measure the endogenous dynamics of generationally poor individuals attempting to escape poverty after experiencing stereotype threat; participants in the stereotype-threat group showed lower-level endogenous poverty-elimination dynamics than those in the control group. In Study 3, a self-affirmation intervention was administered to the stereotype-threat group after the stereotype threat was induced. Participants in the self-affirmation group were shown to have higher-level endogenous poverty-elimination dynamics than those in the control group. DiscussionThese findings confirm the negative effect of stereotype threat on endogenous poverty-elimination dynamics and verify the effectiveness of self-affirmation in mitigating the negative effects of stereotype threat.

AB In this study, we explored whether there are different types of employee procrastination. A total of 2258 multinatinal corporation full-time employees (M = 40.32 years, 46.4% male) took part in the study. Latent class analysis was implemented using 15 categorical adult procrastination items to explore classes of employee procrastination. Multinomial logistic regression was conducted to ascertain whether employee procrastination classes could be differentiated by life satisfaction and demographic variables (i.e., income). The results showed three classes regarding the employee procrastination: lowest procrastination group, lower procrastination group, and high procrastination group. Life satisfaction, age, and whether or not one has kids were predictive of group membership in certain procrastination groups compared to high procrastination group. Preventative public policy and intervention strategies designed to overcome procrastination in multinational corporation employees should improve life satisfaction and should be tailored to the type-specific reasons (e.g. high procrastination group).

AB TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1), also called TEF-1, acts as a transcriptional enhancer to regulate muscle-specific gene expression. However, the role of TEAD1 in regulating intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation in goats is unclear. The aim of this study was to obtain the sequence of TEAD1 gene and elucidate the effect of TEAD1 on goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation in vitro and its possible mechanism. The results showed that the goat TEAD1 gene CDS region sequence was 1311 bp. TEAD1 gene was widely expressed in goat tissues, with the highest expression in brachial triceps (p < 0.01). The expression of TEAD1 gene in goat intramuscular adipocytes at 72 h was extremely significantly higher than that at 0 h (p < 0.01). Overexpression of goat TEAD1 inhibited the accumulation of lipid droplets in goat intramuscular adipocyte. The relative expression of differentiation marker genes SREBP1, PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta were significantly down-regulated (all p < 0.01), but PREF-1 was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.01). Binding analysis showed that there were multiple binding sites between the DNA binding domain of goat TEAD1 and the promoter binding region of SREBP1, PPAR gamma, C/EBP beta and PREF-1. In conclusion, TEAD1 negatively regulates the differentiation of goat intramuscular preadipocytes.

AB Intramuscular fat contributes to the improvement of goat meat quality. N-6-Methyladenosine (m6A)-modified circular RNAs play important roles in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which m6A modifies circRNA before and after differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, we performed methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and circRNA sequencing (circRNA-seq) to determine the distinctions in m6A-methylated circRNAs during goat adipocyte differentiation. The profile of m6A-circRNA showed a total of 427 m6A peaks within 403 circRNAs in the intramuscular preadipocytes group, and 428 peaks within 401 circRNAs in the mature adipocytes group. Compared with the intramuscular preadipocytes group, 75 peaks within 75 circRNAs were significantly different in the mature adipocytes group. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of intramuscular preadipocytes and mature adipocytes showed that the differentially m6A-modified circRNAs were enriched in the PKG signaling pathway, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, lysine degradation, etc. m6A-circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks predicted the potential m6A-circRNA regulation mechanism in different goat adipocytes. Our results indicate that there is a complicated regulatory relationship between the 12 upregulated and 7 downregulated m6A-circRNAs through 14 and 11 miRNA mediated pathways, respectively. In addition, co-analysis revealed a positive association between m6A abundance and levels of circRNA expression, such as expression levels of circRNA_0873 and circRNA_1161, which showed that m6A may play a vital role in modulating circRNA expression during goat adipocyte differentiation. These results would provide novel information for elucidating the biological functions and regulatory characteristics of m6A-circRNAs in intramuscular adipocyte differentiation and could be helpful for further molecular breeding to improve meat quality in goats.

AB We herein report a novel chiral magnetic molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite (MMoS2/PNG-CD) with a high enantioselectivity and excellent thermosensitivity and magnetism. The prepared MMoS2/PNG-CD shows temperature-dependent chiral discrimination and enantioselectivity toward a chiral drug RS-propranolol (RS-PPL), which is based on the molecular recognition ability of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and the thermosensitivity of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). The synthesized MMoS2/PNG2-CD by using a monomer molar ratio of GMA to NIPAM of 2 : 1 demonstrates a high selectivity toward R-PPL over S-PPL due to the synergistic effect of the PNIPAM moieties and beta-CD hosts. The thermo-induced volume phase transition (VPT) of the introduced PNIPAM moieties significantly affects the inclusion constants of the beta-CD/R-PPL complex, and thus the loading and desorption of R-PPL on the MMoS2/PNG2-CD. The enantioselectivity at temperatures below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNG-beta-CD grafting chains is much higher than that at temperatures above the LCST. As a result, the regeneration of the MMoS2/PNG2-CD is easily achieved via simply changing the operating temperature. Moreover, the regenerated MMoS2/PNG2-CD can be readily recovered from the RS-PPL solution under an external magnetic field for reuse. Such a multifunctional molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite with a high enantioselectivity and excellent thermosensitivity and regenerability is promising to serve as a high-performance nanoselector for direct resolution of various beta-blocker drugs.

AB This work investigates the finite-time stability (FTS) issue for a class of inertial neural networks (INNs) with mixed-state time-varying delays, proposing a novel analytical approach. Firstly, we establish a novel FTS lemma, which is entirely different from the existing FTS theorems, and extend the current research results. Secondly, an improved discontinuous reliable control mechanism is developed, which is more valid and widens the application scope compared to previous results. Then, by using a novel non-reduced order approach (NROA) and the Lyapunov functional theory, novel sufficient criteria are established using FTS theorems to estimate the settling time with respect to a finite-time stabilization of INNs. Finally, the simulation results are given to validate the usefulness of the theoretical results.

AB The poor oral bioavailability of arctiin caused by its low water solubility is the biggest obstacle in developing it as a drug. In this work, a new water-soluble glucuronide derivative of arctiin (arctigenin-4 '-O-glucuronide) was synthesized through 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl mediated oxidation reaction. Subsequently, its anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by mice acute lung injury model in vivo. The results showed that the glucuronide derivative of arctiin not only had better water solubility but also displayed improved anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, thus serving as an innovative compound in the drug development of arctiin.

AB Oil leakage incidentally occurs and leads to environmental disasters. Because of their porous and hydrophobic characteristics, graphene sponges are often studied as an oil adsorbent to repair oil spills at sea. Graphene materials are very expensive, and their biological toxicity has been given serious concerns; however, the easier preparation and eco-friendly, biomass-derived porous carbon materials can be used as an alternative to graphene materials. In this study, we prepared a porous carbon sponge (PCS) for oil and organic solvent removal by carbonizing white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a fast-growing microorganism for the production of lignin-degrading enzymes and the environmental remediation. P. chrysosporium fungus balls were converted into black PCS by carbonization at high temperatures, where PCS was light (density of 56 g/L), hydrophobic (contact angle of 115 degrees) and porous. According to the results of BET and XPS analysis, the surface area of PCS was 14.43 m(2)/g, and the carbon in PCS is mainly sp(2) carbon. PCS could adsorb pure oils and organic solvents within seconds. The adsorption capacities of PCS were 20.7 g/g for gasoline, 30.1 g/g for peanut oil, 27.7 g/g for toluene, 18.5 g/g for dodecane, 32.5 g/g for chloroform, 27.1 g/g for tetrahydrofuran, 23.7 g/g for acetone and 13.7 g/g for ethanol. According to the reusability study, there was no obvious capacity loss after recycling up to 10 cycles. Our results indicated that white-rot fungi could be adopted as a cheap carbon resource for oil and organic solvent removal.

AB Understanding the diet of threatened wildlife is vital for species-specific conservation and habitat management measures. The Red-crowned Crane (Grus japonensis) is a vulnerable bird distributed in Northeast Asia. Previous dietary studies of this bird focused mainly on its plant food composition based on field observations and microhistological identification. Herein, a total of 45 fecal samples were collected in November, December and January (15 fecal samples each month) from wintering cranes, and then subjected to a high throughput sequencing meta-barcoding approach to determine the primary plant (rbcL) and animal (COI) food items in their diet. A total of 230 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of plant foods and 371 OTUs of animal foods were obtained. The main plant foods in the wintering period were Miscanthus, Zea, and Hordeum genera, which were similar to those in the breeding and the migration periods. Both agricultural and natural plants were detected, indicating a relatively broad dietary niche for this crane species. However, the main animal foods were representatives of Theridiidae, Megascolecidae, and Agelenidae, in sharp contrast to previous studies. The higher number of small terrestrial arthropods in animal foods might be due to the indirect intake of plants. The composition of both plant and animal foods in the diet showed the highest diversity in December, while it was homogeneous in January. The plant of Zea genus became the main source of nutrition in late winter, as supplementary feeding was performed in the reserve, which could help Red-crowned Cranes to get through the cold season. The results obtained in this work would contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies for the Red-crowned Crane.

AB Context Wuzi Yanzong Prescription (WYP) has long been used to treat male infertility, with convincing clinical evidence. However, its mechanism of action is not clear. Objective WYP chemical components were quantified by HPLC, and the effect on oligoasthenozoospermia rats was explored based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS metabonomics technology. Materials and methods The solution was extracted by alcohol and water; the content of eight components in the extracting solution was determined by HPLC. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (CG), model (MG) and administration (PG) groups. Oligoasthenozoospermia was induced for 30 days in all, but the CG with daily oral doses of 20 mg/kg Tripterysium glycosides (TG). PG was given daily oral doses of WYP solution (1.08 g/kg), CG and MG received the same volume of distilled water, all administered for 30 days. After the last administration, the serum samples were collected and detected by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Results An HPLC method for simultaneous determination of chlorogenic acid (0.081%), ellagic acid (0.021%), hyperoside (0.032%), verbascoside (0.011%), isoquercitrin (0.041%), astragalin (0.026%), kaempferol (0.009%) and schisandrin (0.014%) was established. Moreover, the 74 potential biomarkers and eight metabolic pathways related to oligoasthenozoospermia were identified by multivariate analysis and metabolite profiling. WYP can regulate 36 markers, mainly involving amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. Discussion and conclusions This is a simple and accurate method for quality control of WYP. It further enriches the potential mechanism of WYP in the treatment of oligoasthenozoospermia. It can provide a theoretical basis for the rational application of WYP.

AB To investigate the characteristics and functions of yak 8-defensin 124 (DEFB124), prokaryotic expression, analysis of gut microbiological and other methods were used in this study. The results showed that the sequence of yak DEFB124 gene was 306 bp in length and 207 bp in open reading frame, which encoded 68 amino acids. Yak DEFB124 protein was highly conserved and had the closest relationship with cattle. Yak DEFB124 protein was a secreted cationic 8-defensin. The recombinant expression plasmid pET32a-DEFB124 was constructed, and an about 24 kDa protein was successfully expressed. Yak DEFB124 protein had inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and its MIC value was 64 mu g/mL. After treating with yak DEFB124 protein, the activities of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) were higher (P < 0.01) in the jejunum tissue, but the activity of lysozyme (LZM) was lower (P < 0.01). The number of goblet cells in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of the mice in the DEFB124 group was increased (P < 0.01). Besides, the ex-pressions of MUC2 mRNA and protein were increased (P < 0.05) after the treatment with yak DEFB124 protein. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in jejunum of mice in DEFB124 group was also increased. In summary, yak DEFB124 protein could increase the number of goblet cells in mice intestine and the abundance of intestinal probiotics Lactobacillus, thereby protecting the intestinal tract and alleviating intestinal damage.

AB Dissatisfaction with facial appearance is one of the strongest contributors to body image disturbance among young Chinese females and leads to a series of psychological and behavioral disorders. By conducting behavioral and ERP experiments, this study illustrates how young females in China with facial dissatisfaction process different levels of facial attractiveness. Experiments 1 and 2 are behavioral experiments in which the dot-probe paradigm was used to explore the participant's attentional bias to facial attractiveness. The results showed that regardless of whether the face image was presented above or below the threshold, young females with facial dissatisfaction exhibited attentional orientation toward lowly attractive faces and attentional avoidance to both lowly and highly attractive faces, while the control group showed difficulty in attentional disengagement from highly attractive faces. In experiment 3, the learning-recognition task was used to examine mnemonic bias toward facial attractiveness among females with facial dissatisfaction, and EEG data were also recorded during the encoding and retrieval phases. The study found that young females with facial dissatisfaction exhibited a mnemonic preference for lowly attractive images at both the encoding and retrieving stages, with higher P1, N170, P2, and N300 induced by lowly attractive faces, while the control group preferred highly attractive faces. In conclusion, young females with facial dissatisfaction tend to exhibit attentional orientation and mnemonic bias toward lowly attractive faces.

AB Machine reading comprehension (MRC) is an important research topic in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, traditional MRC models often face challenges of information loss, lack of capability to retain long-distance dependence, and inability to deal with unanswerable questions where answers are not available in given texts. In this paper, a Chinese reading comprehension algorithm, called the Attention and Conditional Random Filed (AT-CRF) Reader, is proposed to address the above challenges. Firstly, RoBERTa, a pre-trained language model, is introduced to obtain the embedding representations of input. Then, a depthwise separable convolution neural network and attention mechanisms are used to replace the recurrent neural network for encoding. Next, the attention flow and self-attention mechanisms are used to obtain the context-query internal relation. Finally, the conditional random field is used to handle unanswerable questions and predict the correct answer. Experiments were conducted on the two Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets, CMRC2018 and DuReader-checklist, and the results showed that, compared with the baseline model, the F1 scores achieved by our AT-CRF Reader model has improved by 2.65% and 2.68%, and the EM values increased by 4.45% and 3.88%.

AB Sichuan Qionglai is located in the Chengdu Plain, where the largest scale and most concentrated stone carves were found in Chengdu. Due to the wet and semi-open storage environment, the statues were seriously damaged, and there is a lack of relevant scientific analysis and research. In this paper, 12 paint samples collected from cliff images in Huazhi Temple, Pantuo Temple in Lincliong Town and Stalagmite Mountain in Datong Town in the Qionglai area were used to obtain the paint information through ultra-depth of field microscopic observation, X-ray fluorescence analysis, X-ray diffraction and micro laser Raman spectroscopy analysis. The results show that the red pigments are hematite [Fe2O3] and lead red [Pb3O4]. The green pigment is copper arsenate [Cu(AsO3) (OH)center dot 2H(2)O] and Euchlorine [KNaCu3O(SO4)(3)]; The white pigment is gypsum [CaSO4]; The yellow pigment is yellow ochre [Fe2O3]. The black pigment is the change product of red lead [Pb3O4], and the blue pigment is lapis lazuli [Na6Ca2Al6Si6O24(SO4)(2)]. It is worth noting that the analysis results of green pigments, in which copper arsenate substances are often detected in the analysis of color painting in recent years, and most of them appear in southwest China. It is judged that it is the product of the change of modern and modern synthetic pigment Paris green, and then it is speculated that there is the possibility of modern and modern repainting here. In addition, the green pigment with Euchlorine has been detected for the first time in this paper, which enriches the analysis of examples of ancient coloring pigments, and it is judged that it may be the result of the change of some green copper minerals. Sichuan area humid environment, some unstable mineral pigments are prone to chemical changes, some produce color change, some color change is not obvious, but the composition has produced new substances. In this paper, the color paints in Qionglai caves were analyze to obtain the relevant information about the pigments used in cliff statues in Sichuan, which provided a scientific basis for the pigment restoration. It was also helpful for cultural relic workers to carry out targeted protection work and provided a reference for the research and protection of color painted grottoes in Sichuan.

AB Vanadium is a long-confined contaminant. In this study, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by the modified Hummers' method and used to remove vanadium(IV). The adsorption isotherms and kinetics of vanadium(IV) on GO at pH 2.5 and three temperatures are measured in batch experiments. The influences of ionic strength is investigated and the regeneration of GO is evaluated by washing with HCl. The results show that the adsorption isotherm corresponds to Temkin model with an adsorption capacity of 70.56 mg/g at 298 K, while the kinetic process coincides with pseudo-second-order model and approaches to equilibrium in 6 h. The adsorption capacity of GO is not influenced by Na+ ionic strength, but sharply inhibited by Ca2+. The superior adsorption is dominated by electrostatic interaction, coordination bonding, and hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the GO is reusable, as shown by maintaining 53.4 % of the initial efficacy after five sequential adsorption-desorption cycles.

AB Tribbles homolog 2 (TRIB2) plays an important role in the follicular development of female mammals. However, its expression and function in the yak (Bos grunniens) are still unclear. In this study, we predicted the molecular characteristics of TRIB2, and revealed its expression pattern in yak (Bos grunniens) tissues and ovarian granulosa cells. We cloned the full length of the yak TRIB2 gene obtained by RT-PCR was 1368 bp and the coding sequence (CDS) was 624 bp, encoding 207 amino acids (AA). Homology analysis showed that the yak TRIB2 is highly conserved among species. TRIB2 was detected to be extensively expressed in seven tissues of the yak liver, spleen, lung, kidney, ovary, oviduct and uterus by qPCR. The expression of TRIB2 mRNA in the ovary during gestation was significantly lower than that in the non-pregnant (p < 0.05). At each stage of follicle development, the TRIB2 mRNA in granulosa cells showed a significant upward trend with the development of follicles. The expression of TRIB2 gradually decreased with the increase of the culture time of the granulosa cells in vitro. In conclusion, these results suggest that TRIB2 may play an important role in the follicular development of yaks.

AB Density functional theory has been used to investigate the structures and properties of Pt-adsorbed carbon nanotubes and Pt-adsorbed thiolated carbon nanotubes. The S-containing ligand provides electrons to the Pt. The HOMO-LUMO gaps of the Pt-adsorbed thiolated carbon nanotubes are also reduced by the S-containing ligand, which improves the activity, stability, and conductivity of the catalyst in the fuel cell. The results can explain the experimental observation of enhance adsorption of Pt atom by S-containing ligand and indicate that thiolated carbon nanotubes would be a good candidate supporter of Pt atom for the fuel cell applications.

These complexes were characterized by FT-IR, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric (TG) ana-lyses, UV-vis, X-ray structural analyses and fluorescence spectra. Complexes 1 and 4 are neutral mixed-ligand molecules. Complex 2 exhibits a 2D chain constructed by [CdCl2(imi)(2)] units. Complex 3 possesses [Ni(imi)(6)](2-)anions with uncoordinated tolulate anions. In complexes 1-4, each imidazole ligand provides one nitrogen atom for coordination. Tolulate and mandelate ligands coordinate to the metal through carboxyl oxygen or hydroxyl oxygen atoms. Plenty of intramolecular hydrogen bonds as N-H...O and O-H...O interactions are observed in these complexes. Fluorescence properties of the complexes have been deeply investigated and the result reveals that Fe3+ ion has the greatest effect on fluorescence intensity of complex 3. The fluorescence intensity decreases with the increase of iron concentration.

AB This paper explores the decentralized, centralized and bargaining models of a supply chain involving an electricity generator and a retailer. We found that the investment cost coefficient negatively impacts the supply chain profits but positively affects price decisions. In contrast, the probability of meeting the COVID-19 emergency positively impacts the supply chain profit and negatively affects price decisions. We contribute by designing a bargaining contract for energy supply chain firms to improve profits on low investment, thereby improving their financial health and competitive advantage. The results imply that financial managers can bridge the revenue gap in COVI9 19 period.

AB Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans) is an ascomycetous fungus that can cause disseminated infection in humans or animals. The present study aimed to explore the pathogenesis and host spleen immune response after infection with A. nidulans. Thirty KM mice were divided into control group (C) and treated group (T). Serum was collected for the detection of inflammatory markers. Spleens were collected for histopathological examination, fungal culture and transcriptomic analysis. Compared with the control group, the concentrations of serum total protein (TP), globulin (GLO) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly increased (P < 0.01), but the concentration of albumin (ALB) and the ratio of albumin/globulin (A/G) were significantly decreased in the treated group (P < 0.01). In addition, the splenic red pulp was hyperemic, and the white pulp was infiltrated by inflammatory cells in treated group. The chromatin was aggregated, and the mitochondria were swollen in the spleen lymphocytes of treated group. Transcriptome sequencing results showed that 47.2 million and 44.9 million clean reads were obtained in the control group and treated group, respectively. 946 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained, including 372 up-regulated genes and 574 down-regulated genes. GO analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly involved in the immune responses, antigen binding, immunoglobulin receptor binding, bacterial defence responses, endopeptidase activity and so on. Moreover, KEGG analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in the following pathways: complement and coagulation cascades, retinol metabolism, cytochrome p450, IL-17 signalling pathway and so on. Additionally, 9 DEGs was validated by qRT-PCR approach. In summary, this study revealed the immune response mechanism of spleen in A. nidulan-infected mice. It will benefit for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of A. nidulans.

DT Article
ID MICRORNAS; NAD(+); EXPRESSION
AB To investigate the effects of miR-499-5p on muscle metabolism in broiler chickens, eight broiler chicks were assigned to the control group and eight to the treatment group, and then we monitored the effects using metabolomics. Chicks were fed basal diets without or with miR-499-5p delivery. Gastrocnemius muscle samples were collected and analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that miR-499-5p injection altered the concentrations of a variety of metabolites in the gastrocnemius muscle. Thereby, a total of 46 metabolites were identified at higher (P<0.05) concentrations and 30 metabolites were identified at lower (P<0.05) concentrations in the treatment group compared with the control group. These metabolites were primarily involved with the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Further metabolic pathway analysis revealed that fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were the most critical pathway which may partially interpret the effects of miR-499-5p. To our knowledge, this research is the first report of metabolic signatures and related metabolic pathways in the skeletal muscle for miR-499-5p injection and provides new insight into the effect of miRNA on growth performance.

AB Simple Summary Cattle-yak is the hybrid between male cattle (Bos taurus) and female yak (Bos grunniens). Male cattle-yak can not produce normal sperm. The mechanisms that underlie cattle-yak male sterility have not been elucidated. Histone acetylation is a common regulation mode that plays an important role in the development of gametes. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of male sterility in yak hybrids based on histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), two enzymes that regulate histone acetylation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HAT1 in the testes of adult cattle-yaks were significantly lower than in adult yaks, and the protein expression levels of HDAC1 were significantly higher than in yaks. In addition, H3K9 acetylation levels in cattle-yak testes were significantly lower than in yaks. These results suggest that male sterility in cattle-yaks might be associated with decreased histone acetylation levels in the testes. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of male sterility in yak hybrids based on HAT1 and HDAC1. Total RNA was extracted from the testes of adult yaks (n = 11) and sterile cattle-yaks (n = 11) followed by reverse transcription. The coding sequence (CDS) of yak HAT1 and HDAC1 were obtained by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene cloning. The testicular mRNA and protein levels of HAT1 and HDAC1 in yaks and cattle-yaks were detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively, and the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) histone acetylation level in the testes of yaks and cattle-yaks was assayed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the CDS of HAT1 and HDAC1 were 1242 bp and 1449 bp in length, encoding 413 and 482 amino acids, respectively; yaks had a similar mRNA sequence as cattle in both genes. The testicular mRNA and protein levels of HAT1 of cattle-yaks were significantly lower than those of yaks, and the protein level of HDAC1 was significantly higher than that of yaks. ELISA showed that the acetylation level of testicular H3K9 was significantly lower in yak hybrids than that of yaks. The present results suggest that the decreased level of HAT1 and increased level of HDAC1 may result in the decreased H3K9 acetylation in cattle-yaks and might be associated with their sterility.

AB Tick-borne diseases have become a global health concern in recent decades. Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae have been recognized as important pathogens of human tick-borne diseases worldwide. In this study, Dermacentor everestianus (n = 646) and Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis (n = 172) ticks were collected from yaks (Bos grunniens) in Shiqu county, eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. SFG rickettsiae were identified and characterized in these ticks. A total of 49.9% (408/818) ticks were infected by Rickettsia spp. with infection rates of 58.1% (100/172) and 46.7% (308/646) detected in H. qinghaiensis and D. everestianus ticks, respectively. Furthermore, 95% of Rickettsia spp. were Rickettsia raoultii-like bacteria, and 5% were related to Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SFG rickettsiae infections were firstly reported in Shiqu county for these tick species. Our results indicated that H. qinghaiensis and D. everestianus ticks from Shiqu county became highly infected with a R. raoultii-like bacteria during their feeding process. This observation is alarming because of the zoonotic potentiality of these species. Overall, the present study detected a widespread of R. raoultii-like bacteria in ticks that are considered a serious threat to domestic animals and humans in Shiqu county. The prevalence of R. raoultii-like bacteria in human and wildlife hosts should be further investigated in the future.

AB Meconopsis bhutanica Tosh.Yoshida & Grey-Wilson (Meconopsis Vig., fam: Papaveraceae), is a Critically Endangered species utilized in Tibetan medicine. Due to the very limited numbers of wild individuals, the chemical and biological basis of its medicinal value has not been studied. The objective of this study was to explore the chemical constituents of Meconopsis bhutanica and to determine the antityrosinase activity and influence on human melanoma cell lines A375. The chemical constituents were mainly isolated through column chromatography and semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography, and the structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The inhibition on tyrosinase was examined by microplate reader. High performance liquid chromatography, spectrofluorophotometer, and molecular docking were used to analyze the effects on the function and structure of tyrosinase. The influence on A375 cells were measured by the Cell Counting Kit. Finally, a total of eleven phenolic compounds were isolated and identified from Meconopsis bhutanica. All of these compounds were found in this plant for the first time. The results of antityrosinase activity assay showed that compound 9 exhibited tyrosinase inhibition obviously. Furthermore, compound 9 could decrease the oxidation products and fluorescence emission intensity of tyrosinase. However, compound 9 had no effect on the proliferation of human melanoma A375 cells at high concentrations. The present paper uncovered the chemical composition of Meconopsis bhutanica and assessed the tyrosinase inhibition activity, which will provide data for comparing bioactive chemical constituents between the wild and cultivated ones. This study paved the way for the conservation, cultivation, and application of Meconopsis bhutanica.

AB Inflammatory chemokine CCL5 can mediate the occurrence of inflammatory reactions and participate in various disease processes. (Ch)CCL5 gene of Jintang black goat (Capra hircus, C. hircus) was cloned. The CDS (coding sequences) was 276 bp in length and encoded 91 amino acids. The 26.5 kDa recombinant protein was expressed by Escherichia coli system and purified by Ni-Agarose. The viabilities of primary goat lung fibroblasts could be enhanced after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and heat-shock proteins (Hsp70) genes were upregulated after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL). Besides, the viabilities and phagocytic abilities of primary mouse peritoneal macrophages could be enhanced after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). The expression levels of IL-1 beta, IL6, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOs) and TNF-alpha genes were upregulated after treating with ChCCL5 protein (12.5, 25, 50 mu g/mL) (P < 0.05). These results indicated that goat CCL5 might play a role in the inflammatory response by regulating the inflammatory cytokines produced by lung fibroblasts and macrophages.

AB A one-pot, three-component difunctionalization of quinones with indoles and arylamines has been developed to synthesize indole functionalized p-iminoquinones derivatives. The approach employed AgOAc as the catalyst in the presence of 3-chlorophenylboronic acid, giving a series of indole functionalized p-iminoquinones derivatives in moderate to good yields. This catalytic approach represents a step-economic and convenient strategy for the difunctionalization of quinones. A plausible reaction pathway has been proposed based on a series of control experiments.

AB Malignancies including ovarian cancer (OvCa) are genetically unstable. Genomic integrity is maintained by tumor suppressor p53 and DNA damage response network, which crosstalk to each other via not well characterized mechanisms. In this work, we characterize features of damage-related signals in cultured epithelial OvCa cells and tumor biopsies. We found that endogenous burden of DNA damage in OvCa tissues were ubiquitously accumulated in high-grade malignancies than lower grade of cancer that cannot be obviously explained by disturbed function of in DNA damage response (DDR). In contrast, CHK1 phosphorylation (CHK1-pS345) marking the checkpoint activation in nucleolar compartments are prevalent in high-grade OvCa, coincident to the elevated DNA damage in nucleoplasm. Generation of CHK1-pS345 requires the presence of p53 protein in addition to the well-known activities of ATM/ATR kinases. Apparently, mutant forms of p53 possess higher activity in triggering CHK1 phosphorylation than wild type, implying a potential role of p53 in maintaining rDNA integrity. Loss of p53 function would cause replication stress in nucleoli. Altogether, our study reveals endogenous nucleoli stress in OvCa that is coupled to perturbed function of p53 in DNA repair.

ID USER EXPERIENCE; DATA PLACEMENT; STRATEGY
AB In recent years, with the continuous development of internet of things and cloud computing technologies, data intensive applications have gotten more and more attention. In the distributed cloud environment, the access of massive data is often the bottleneck of its performance. It is very significant to propose a suitable data deployment algorithm for improving the utilization of cloud server and the efficiency of task scheduling. In order to reduce data access cost and data deployment time, an optimal data deployment algorithm is proposed in this paper. By modeling and analyzing the data deployment problem, the problem is solved by using the improved genetic algorithm. After the data are well deployed, aiming at improving the efficiency of task scheduling, a task progress aware scheduling algorithm is proposed in this paper in order to make the speculative execution mechanism more accurate. Firstly, the threshold to detect the slow tasks and fast nodes are set. Then, the slow tasks and fast nodes are detected by calculating the remaining time of the tasks and the real-time processing ability of the nodes, respectively. Finally, the backup execution of the slow tasks is performed on the fast nodes. While satisfying the load balancing of the system, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can obviously reduce data access cost, service-level agreement (SLA) default rate and the execution time of the system and optimize data deployment for improving scheduling efficiency in distributed clouds.

ID EVOLUTION
AB The stomach lysozymes of ruminants play a paramount role in digestion and offer the chance to probe evolutionary changes in complex organisms on a biochemical basis. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of the catalytic properties of Tibetan ruminant (TR) stomach lysozymes and provide a comparative study of TR stomach lysozymes and nonplateau ruminant stomach lysozymes. The stomach lysozymes were purified with a Carboxymethyl (CM) Sepharose Fast Flow (FF) column and a Bio-Gel P-100 column. The purified stomach lysozymes were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate??? polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS???PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDITOF) analyses. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using an agar diffusion method, and the pH, ion strength, temperature, pepsin and trypsin effects on enzymatic activities were evaluated by normal biochemistry methods. The stomach lysozymes of TRs (cattle:TC, yak:TY, and sheep:TS) exhibit maximum activity at pH 5 and ionic strengths below 0.02. TC and TS stomach lysozymes are more resistant to higher temperatures than nonplateau lysozymes. Stomach lysozymes of TRs exhibit greater enzymatic activity than nonplateau lysozymes, in the presence of pepsin and trypsin. Stomach lysozymes from TS retain 86% of their initial enzymatic activity against pepsin inactivation. After trypsin treatment, the stomach lysozymal activities of TRs were significantly affected by trypsin inactivation, with the exception of TS, whose enzymatic activities in the presence of trypsin were 5-and 10-fold higher than those of nonplateau lysozymes. The stomach lysozymes of TRs are more resistant to environmental factors such as pH, temperature, pepsin, and trypsin than nonplateau lysozyme C.

AB The kinetic theory is applied to investigate the impact of knowledge level on the proportion of wealth in the stock market. Assume that each agent's wealth is non-negative in the financial market and agents are allowed to choose their own portfolios in the stock and bond. The nonlinear Boltzmann models describing the investment proportion of wealth between the two assets and knowledge formation are discussed. In the models, the agent's knowledge level and psychological factors affect their investment strategies and risk prediction. A value function containing the current price and intrinsic value of the stock is used to depict the agent's psychological factors. The asymptotic procedure is employed to obtain the Fokker-Planck equation relating to the Boltzmann model. The numerical simulation experiments illustrate that knowledge has the potential to increase the proportion of wealth invested in the stock and improve the wealth status of agents.

The porous morphology of the material increases the benzene gas contact area. The maximum adsorption capacity of benzene, according to the Langmuir model, is 128.98 mg/g and 132.22 mg/g, respectively. The method has a large adsorption capacity, good adsorption effect, non-toxic and harmless, low recycling cost, recyclable multiple times, simple operation, stable structure, no secondary environmental pollution, etc., and has good application prospects in the wood drying industry.

AB Conducting a second production run can improve the company's capability of meeting the market demand. Few works examine optimal input quantity decisions under the mode with two production chances considering demand and yield uncertainty. We propose a vendor-managed inventory (VMI) supply chain with one supplier and one retailer. The supplier has two production chances and faces yield uncertainty in each production run. It is necessary for the supplier to make trade-offs between the cost and benefit of the second production run, then decide whether to conduct the second production run. We investigate the supplier's optimal input quantity decision in each production run and obtain the supply chain members' expected profits. As a comparison, the mode with one production chance is also developed. We find that two production chances can help improve the performance of the supply chain under yield uncertainty. A revenue-sharing contract is introduced to coordinate the supply chain with two production chances, and efficient profit allocation is achieved through adjusting the revenue-sharing ratio and the wholesale price. An extension is conducted for a sensitivity analysis of unit punishment cost on the supplier's input quantity decisions.

AB Animal husbandry is the pillar industry in some ethnic areas of China. However, the communication/networking infrastructure in these areas is often underdeveloped, thus the difficulty in centralized management, and challenges for the effective monitoring. Considering the dynamics of the field monitoring environment, as well as the diversity and mobility of monitoring targets, traditional WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) or IoT (Internet of Things) is difficult to meet the surveillance needs. Mobile surveillance that features the collaboration of various functions (camera, sensing, image recognition, etc.) deployed on mobile devices is desirable in a volatile wireless environment. This paper proposes the service function chaining for mobile surveillance of animal husbandry, which orchestrates multi-path multifunction (MPMF) chains to help mobile devices to collaborate in complex surveillance tasks, provide backup chains in case the primary service function chain fails due to mobility, signal strength, obstacle, etc., and make up for the defects of difficult deployment of monitoring facilities in ethnic areas. MPMF algorithm models both mobile devices and various functions deployed on them as abstract graph nodes, so that chains that are required to traverse various functions and hosting mobile devices can be orchestrated in a single graph based query through modified and adapted Dijkstra-like algorithms, with their cost ordered automatically. Experiment results show that the proposed MPMF algorithm finds multiple least-costly chains that traverse demanded functions in a timely fashion on Raspberry Pi-equipped mobile devices.

AB In meteorological and electric power Internet of Things scenarios, in order to extend the service life of relevant facilities and reduce the cost of emergency repair, the intelligent inspection swarm is introduced to cooperate with monitoring tasks, which collect and process the current scene data through a variety of sensors and cameras, and complete tasks such as emergency handling and fault inspection. Due to the limitation of computing resources and battery life of patrol inspection equipment, it will cause problems such as slow response in emergency and long time for fault location. Mobile Edge Computing is a promising technology, which can improve the quality of service of the swarm by offloading the computing task of the inspection equipment to the edge server nearby the network. In this paper, we study the problem of computing offloading of multidevices multi-tasks and multi-servers in the intelligent patrol inspection swarm under the condition of a dynamic network environment and limited resources of servers and inspection equipment. An effective adaptive learning offloading strategy based on distributed reinforcement learning and multi-classification is proposed to reduce the task processing delay and energy consumption of the intelligent inspection swarm and improve the service quality. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is superior to other offloading strategies in terms of time delay, energy consumption and quality of service.

ID MODEL
AB The concepts of ecology, environmental protection, health, and sustainable development are gradually being deepened in economic activities. Ecological, environmentally friendly, low-carbon and green marketing, as a mainstream marketing model in the 21st century, is sweeping the world. By studying sustainable corporate development methods such as green products, green services, and green marketing models, the companies could win the trust and support of the public, increase market profit opportunities, and ensure their survival and development. This paper uses the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight to establish a nonferrous metal enterprise green marketing performance evaluation model. Three companies from Jiangxi Copper, Jinchuan Group and Shaanxi Nonferrous Metals are selected for empirical analysis. The research shows that from the perspective of economic performance, Jiangxi Copper is the one with more outstanding economic benefits, and its green marketing economic performance index is up to 0.3999, indicating that the company has strong competitiveness in the green marketing system. From the perspective of ecological performance, Shaanxi Nonferrous Metals has good results in energy consumption (0.1641) and pollution control (0.0758), while Jiangxi Copper's ecological performance (0.0838) is relatively low with the highest energy consumption. Jinchuan Group has the smallest investment in ecological protection and energy saving and emission reduction. Therefore, the ecological performance score (0.0148) is the lowest, indicating that Jinchuan Group has not implemented the green marketing concept into production and business activities. From the perspective of social performance, the highest score of public welfare-related indicators in the social performance of Jinchuan Group is 0.0668, indicating that the company pays attention to its responsibilities in society. The empirical analysis shows that the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is suitable for the evaluation of the company's green marketing performance. Constructing a corporate green marketing performance evaluation system and using scientific methods to correctly evaluate corporate green marketing performance can guide companies to implement green marketing activities, identify weak links in green marketing performance, and improve corporate green marketing performance.

AB H+6%He mixed neutral beam with a power density of 8 MV m(-2) and fluence of 10(25) m(-2) is produced to induce irradiation damage at surface temperatures of 400, 800, and 1300 degrees C in WK alloy, and at 400 and 800 degrees C in pure W samples. Doppler-broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (DB-PAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are used to probe the evolution of vacancy-type defects in the samples after irradiation. The results show that for the WK alloy, the S-parameters for the 400, 800, and 1300 degrees C samples increase sequentially because of the increase in vacancy-type defect concentrations or volumes. The WK sample at 1300 degrees C exhibits a wider defect damage layer and more complicated vacancy-type defects than those in the WK samples at 400 and 800 degrees C. For pure W, the S-parameter of the 800 degrees C samples is larger than that of the 400 degrees C samples, which is attributed to the aggregation and growth of vacancy-type defects. Based on a comparison of the WK and pure W samples, the pinning effect of K bubbles in the WK samples has an influence on the transportation of H/He atoms and the migration and aggregation of vacancy-type defects.

AB KLF7 belongs to the Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) family, which function as transcriptional regulators controlling a number of basic cellular processes, involving proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Here, we reveal insights into the differentiated expression of KLF7 in different goat tissues and different stages of growth, and the inhibition role of KLF7 knockdown to differentiation by using goat intramuscular and subcutaneous preadipocytes. We demonstrate that KLF7 expression is obviously changed during the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Knockdown of KLF7 inhibited lipid droplet accumulation, reduced the expression of adipogenic markers both in intramuscular and subcutaneous preadipocytes in goats, suggesting that KLF7 is a novel regulator of adipogenesis. KLF7 expression changed also up or down-regulation the other KLF family members, but there were differences between these two types of cells. Investigation into the mechanism that KLF7 regulates preadipocyte differentiation revealed that KLF family members KLF1, KLF5, KLF6, KLF8, KLF11, KLF12, KLF16, KLF17 and adipogenic markers C/EBP alpha and SREBP1 promoter region present KLF7 transcriptional binding sites. Altogether, the data here identify KLF7 as a novel regulator of adipogenesis.

AB In this paper, we consider two types of traveling wave systems of the generalized Kundu-Mukherjee-Naskar equation. Firstly, due to the integrity, we obtain their energy functions. Then, the dynamical system method is applied to study bifurcation behaviours of the two types of traveling wave systems to obtain corresponding global phase portraits in different parameter bifurcation sets. According to them, every bounded and unbounded orbits can be identified clearly and investigated carefully which correspond to various traveling wave solutions of the generalized Kundu-Mukherjee-Naskar equation exactly. Finally, by integrating along these orbits and calculating some complicated elliptic integral, we obtain all type I and type II traveling wave solutions of the generalized Kundu-Mukherjee-Naskar equation without loss.

AB The visual characteristics of animals with different circadian habits, especially colubrid snakes, exhibit highly variable photoreceptor morphology. While studies have reported on the diversity in retinal cell morphology among snakes with different circadian patterns, few studies have examined the expression of genes related to vision. To explore gene expression patterns in the eyes between diurnal and nocturnal snakes, we carried out RNA sequencing of six tissues (eye, heart, liver, lung, kidney, and muscle) in two colubrids with disparate circadian activities, i.e., diurnal Ahaetulla prasina and nocturnal Lycodon flavozonatum, followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The genes in the two most correlated modules were primarily enriched in different functional pathways, thus suggesting different biological functions. Three opsin genes (RH1, LWS, and SWS) were differentially expressed between the two species. Moreover, in the phototransduction pathway, different genes were highly expressed in the eyes of both species, reflecting specific expression patterns in the eyes of snakes with different circadian activity. We also confirmed the dominance of cone- and rod-related genes in diurnal and nocturnal adaptation, respectively. This work provides an important foundation for genetic research on visual adaptation in snakes and provides further insight into the adaptive evolution of such species.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis disequilibrium in mitochondrial apoptosis and its impact on yak meat tenderness. Results indicated that CaCl2 treatment significantly promoted glycolysis by increasing lactic acid level and decreasing glycogen content, pH, and ATP production (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). The activities of Na+-K+-ATPase pump and Ca2+ ATPase pump in the early aging stage were significantly influenced by CaCl2 treatment. The activities of synchronous digital hierarchy and citrate synthase were also significantly improved by CaCl2 treatment (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly higher in the CaCl2 group than in the control group (P < 0.01); at 24 h, the value in the Ca2+ group was 64.27% higher than that in the control group. Furthermore, CaCl2 treatment significantly enhanced the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade reaction and meat tenderization by improving the myofibril fragmentation index and shear force (P < 0.01). These results demonstrated that the imbalance of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis played a significant role in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by regulating energy metabolism factors, meat intracellular environment, mitochondrial functions, and ROS-mediated oxidative stress. These conditions further improved meat tenderization during postmortem aging.

AB The performance and quality of electric vehicle batteries have an important impact on the user experience of new energy vehicles. The power battery pack needs to go through a strict inspection process before being installed on the vehicle. There is no doubt that the efficiency of battery testing is the key to the production capacity of new energy vehicles. Develop an efficient, practical and stable battery testing system to automate the battery testing process, reduce the misoperation of the testing personnel, ensure the safety of the testing personnel as much as possible and greatly increase the production capacity of new energy vehicles. Nevertheless, the method of general measuring instrument in traditional EOL field test is manual debugging, which has low efficiency and low degree of automation, which cannot meet the increasingly complex field test circuit. Hence, it is very necessary to integrate component automation systems to further improve measurement efficiency. Based on the test content in the EOL test, this paper designs and develops a highly automated test and diagnosis system, introduces several general measuring instruments into the system and discards the VB and MFC in the host computer and replaces it with the introduction of SCPI commands and python. The use of Ethernet to form a path between the physical layer and program control aims to make the automatic testing of general electronic equipment and remote circuit modules a reality. This article introduces the instrument circuit hardware module and host computer language programming module in detail. The final results show that the system has good portability and robustness and is suitable for running on various platforms.

AB Wound healing process is usually accompanied by infection and the wound dressing loaded with antibiotics is usually used to treat skin wound. However, the intensive use of antibiotics may lead to development of resistance and the antibiotic resistance has become a major global problem. Finding new wound dressing with sustained antibacterial property to overcome the problem of resistance is one of clinical challenge. In this work, phenolic acids in Spenceria ramalana Trimen and sliver nanoparticle incorporated thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibrous membrane (TPU/AgNPs/TPA) are fabricated via electrospinning. The TPU/AgNPs/TPA membrane exhibits excellent physicochemical properties with uniform morphology, good mechanical capacity, and appropriate hydrophilia providing suitable environment for wound healing. Moreover, the TPU/AgNPs/TPA membrane shows mild antioxidant property and exhibits continuous antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli especially against drug-resistant E. coli. The antibacterial efficiency is as high as 99% lasting for 36 h. Furthermore, the TPU/AgNPs/TPA membrane used as wound dressing can accelerate wound healing through downregulating TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor. Therefore, the TPU/AgNPs/TPA membrane presented in this work with good antibacterial activity is an excellent wound dressing and has great potential in wound healing applications to overcome the problem of resistance.

AB The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most widely distributed nonhuman primate species, and captive populations play an important role in biomedical research due to close phylogenetic and physiological similarity to human beings. However, to our best knowledge, the spondyloarthritis (SpA) in rhesus macaques has been exclusively reported in captive or semicaptive populations rather than wild counterparts. In the present study, we report 2 cases of SpA observed in Taihangshan macaques (Macaca mulatta tcheliensis) inhabiting the Taihangshan Macaque National Nature Reserve, Henan Province, China. Among these 2 cases, one can be diagnosed as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) following accepted medical criteria, and another case showed evident fusion at the pubic symphysis which could be specific to rhesus macaque AS. We discuss the potential causes leading directly or indirectly to the development of SpA.

AB Given the complexity and uncertainty of the current COVID-19 risks, the elderly people in long-term care facilities are at the highest risk for infection. In order to study the prevention and control strategies of COVID-19 risks in long-term care facilities, this paper uses the prospect theory to construct the decision-making model of COVID-19 risk behavior of long-term care facilities, analyses the risk behavior strategies of the caregivers and managers, and reveals the impact of risk management cost, risk loss and external supervision on the risk behavior decision-making of the caregivers and managers. Furthermore, from the perspective of long-term care facilities, this paper analyzes the constraints that enable it to achieve optimal risk management strategy. Combined with the simulation analysis, it is found that the decision of risk behavior of the caregivers and managers is positively related to the risk behavior choice, risk loss, and supervision. Then, only when the incentives set by the supervision are within a reasonable range can the caregivers and managers be motivated to take proactive risk management strategies. The study has important theoretical and practical significance for the management of COVID-19 risks in long-term care facilities.

Without any parameter constraints, we investigate their traveling wave systems in detail from the geometric point of view. Due to the existence of a two dimensional invariant manifold, all bounded and unbounded orbits are identified and studied in different parameter bifurcation sets. Furthermore, by calculating complicated elliptic integrals along these orbits, we obtain exact expressions of all possible single wave solutions of two types of GBS equations.

In existing approaches, the sequence information of switching subsystems is seldom exploited. By exploiting the sequence information, threshold values can be less restrictive and more appropriate for the situation. We study two cases in this paper: (a) all subsystems are unstable, and (b) part of the subsystems are unstable. Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are studied, and a numerical example is given to show the advantage of our approach.

AB A 200-cm-long, 300 mu m-depth and 80 mu m-wide gas chromatographic (GC) column was fabricated on the silicon chip by microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technique in this work. Unlike the traditional open gas chromatographic column, the design and fabrication of the MEMS-based GC column folded in a wavy configuration which was filled with a circular micro column with a diameter of 30 mu m. The size, shape and distribution of the semi-packed column in the prepared micro. chromatographic column were analyzed by finite element analysis software to obtain the optimized preparation parameters. The simulation revealed that MEMS-based semi-packed gas chromatography wavy column achieved an even flow velocity, resulting in a successive improvement of the flow uniformity at the zones between two adjacent bends, as well as a more nonsymmetric distribution at the bends. Benzene and toluene were separated by the fabricated GC column within 1.5 min. In addition, the N-alkane component were separated and the plate number reached 4790 plates/m.

AB This paper investigates the problem of estimating a random parameter in a linear observation model when the transformation matrix suffers stochastic uncertainties. In practice, the uncertainties can be either the bounded uncertainties or the Gaussian uncertainties. The existing minimax robust estimation method is only applicable to the bounded uncertainties, and minimizes the worst-case mean squared error (MSE) over the region of uncertainties, irrespective of the probability of such worst-case scenario, so it tends to be overly conservative. A probability-constrained (PC) robust linear estimation method is proposed in this paper to minimize the MSE with a guaranteed probability, which can handle bounded uncertainties as well as Gaussian uncertainties. However, the formulated problem is not analytically tractable due to the unspecified distribution of the uncertainties, so two approximate PC robust estimators are derived by tackling two upper bounds of the original optimization problem and converting them to semidefinite programming problems with the safe tractable approximation techniques. The comparative analysis reveals that there is a tradeoff between the MSE performance and computation complexity in the proposed two PC estimators. The Monte Carlo simulations are used to corroborate the theoretical results, which demonstrate that the proposed PC estimators are robust to the uncertainties compared to the nominal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the nominal best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), and are less conservative compared to the traditional minimax robust estimator.

AB Bitcoin mining consumes tremendous amounts of electricity to solve the hash problem. At the same time, large-scale applications of artificial intelligence (AI) require efficient and secure computing. There are many computing devices in use, and the hardware resources are highly heterogeneous. This means a cooperation mechanism is needed to realize cooperation among computing devices, and a good calculation structure is required in the case of data dispersion. In this paper, we propose an architecture where devices (also called nodes) can reach a consensus on task results using off-chain smart contracts and private data. The proposed distributed computing architecture can accelerate computing-intensive and data-intensive supervised classification algorithms with limited resources. This architecture can significantly increase privacy protection and prevent leakage of distributed data. Our proposed architecture can support heterogeneous data, making computing on each device more efficient. We used mathematical formulas to prove the correctness and robustness of our system and deduced the condition to stop a given task In the experiments, we transformed Bitcoin hash collision into distributed computing on several nodes and evaluated the training and prediction accuracy for handwritten digit images (MNIST). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Electrochemical coupling halobenzene into biphenyl on a reusable Pd

SO NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Electrochemical organic synthesis (EOS) employing electrons to directly activate the reactants can readily complete the chemical conversion under mild conditions. Here, it presented an efficient electrochemical coupling halobenzene into biphenyl on a Pd nanoparticle-coated cathode. The biphenyl product can be obtained with a yield up to 77% at 35 mA, 6 h (3.9 F mol(-1)). In addition, after consecutive fifth run of the coupling reaction, the yield still remained at ca. 40%, suggesting its considerable recyclable capacity. In addition, the preliminary kinetics study via the off-line gas chromatography analysis of the reaction mixture shows a two-section reaction process, including the introduction process (IP) and fast conversion process (FCP). Further, the estimated reaction kinetics constant value of 0.196 min(-1) for FCP suggests a more effective conversion than that obtained by the previous study. This study adopts a simple way to fabricate a low-cost and reusable Pd electrode, achieving a high-efficiency electrochemical strategy for the Ullmann-type coupling reaction at mild conditions, and holds a great promise to extend this synthesis route to other important organic synthesis.

ID CALICIVIRUS
AB Neboviruses (NeVs) are important causative agents of calf diarrhea that belong to the family Caliciviridae. In this study, we investigated the genomic characteristics of a NeV strain from yaks that has a novel RdRp genotype. The complete genome of this strain (YAK/NRG-A9/19/CH) is 7454 nt in length and shares 68.3%-79.7% nt sequence identity with those of other NeVs. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of this strain shares 66.5%-78.5% nt sequence identity (74.0%-89.3% aa sequence identity) with the eight available complete NeV RdRp sequences, and a phylogenetic analysis based on these sequences showed that the new strain formed an independent branch, indicating that the RdRp of strain YAK/NRG-A9/19/CH may represent a novel RdRp genotype of NeV. These results contribute to a further understanding of the molecular characteristics and genetic evolution of NeVs.

AB Impairment of genome instability drives the development of cancer by disrupting anti-cancer barriers. Upon genotoxic insults, DNA damage responsive factors, notably ATM kinase, is crucial to protect genomic integrity while promoting cell death. Meanwhile, cytotoxic therapy-inducing DNA lesions is double-edged sword by causing cancer metastasis based on animal models and clinical observations. The underlying mechanisms for the procancer effect of cytotoxic therapies are poorly understood. Here, we report that cancer cells subjected to cytotoxic treatments elicit dramatic alteration of gene expression controlling the potential of epithelium-mesenchyme transition (EMT). Resultantly, EMT-dependent cell mobility is potently induced upon DNA damage. This stimulation of EMT is mainly Ataxia-Telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent, as the chemical inhibitor specifically inhibiting ATM kinase activity can suppress the EMT gene expression and thus cell mobility. At last, we show that cancer cells with ATM activation display increased metastatic potential in ovarian cancer tissues. Taken together, we reveal a novel role of ATM in promoting metastatic potential of cancer cells by favoring EMT gene expression.

AB The phospholipase pl-S.t gene of Sphingobacterium thalpophilum 2015 was cloned and the gene sequence was submitted to NCBI with Accession Number KX674735.1. The phylogenetic analysis showed that this PL-S.t was clustered to phospholipase D (PLD). As far as we know, the PL-S.t with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa is the lowest of the currently purified bacterial PLDs, which belongs to a non-HKD PLD enzyme. This PL-S.t was resistant to a wide range of alkali pHs (7.5-9.0) after 1 h incubation, retaining more than 90% of its maximum activity. The PL-S.t activity can be enhanced by Ni2+, Co2+ and Mn2+. This PL-S.t has only one cysteine residue and fewer negatively-charged amino acids (AAs). The hydrogen bonds network was found around the cystein108, which may be beneficial to the stability and activity of PL-S.t in Ni2+ solution. This study has laid the foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of the catalytic characteristics of low molecular weight alkalic PLD from S. thalpophilum 2015.

AB Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a common and high-efficiency technique for detecting the mRNA levels of genes where suitable reference genes were introduced to normalize the data of RT-qPCR. However, little is known about the suitable reference genes in the adipose tissue of Jianzhou da'er goat. Here, six housekeeping genes, including the ACTB, ALAS1, EIF3K, HSP90, RPLP0, and UXT, were selected as candidate reference genes, while the FASN, HSL, LPL, and PID1 were used as the target genes for the validation of the suitability of identified reference genes. After detecting the expression levels of selected genes, the geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder softwares were applied to analyze the obtained data of candidate reference genes. The suitability analysis showed that the HSP90 was the most stable candidate reference gene, followed by the ALAS1 and RPLP0 gene. The validation experiment not only verified that the HSP90 was more stable than ACTB as the reference gene, but also confirmed that the HSP90 alone and a combination of HSP90, ALAS1, and RPLP0 could play the same roles in the normalization of target genes. Therefore, we strongly suggested that the HSP90 alone and the combination of three genes (HSP90, ALAS1, and RPLP0) could be used as the suitable reference for normalizing gene expression data in adipose tissue of Jianzhou da'er goat.

AB The study explored the psychological factors of post-traumatic stress disorder, which occurs as a result of stress on the background of COVID-19. An outbreak of a previously unknown disease, prolonged self-isolation, contradictory information in the media, and an economic crisis - all these are today's realities that have arisen due to the coronavirus pandemic. In such conditions, society is particularly in need of developing measures to overcome post-traumatic stress, which is preceded by the identification of its patterns, connections with certain psychological and other factors. Hypothesis: negative coping strategies and low indicators of subjective well-being are correlated with high indicators of post-traumatic stress in a sample of Chinese students. As a sample a total of 306 Chinese students were interviewed, including 161 students studying in China and 145 students studying outside their country (Russia, England, USA). Methods: "Subjective well-being" (IOW); post-traumatic stress self-assessment questionnaire (PTSD); assessment of stress management style (SCSD). A sample of students from China showed a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.221**), the overall mood and stress index (0.356**), and subjective well-being and stress (0.191*); negative correlation between active coping strategies and the overall mood index (-0.321"). In the sample of Chinese students studying abroad, there is a positive correlation between passive coping strategies and stress (0.394**), active coping strategies and subjective well-being (0.283*), and the mood and stress index (0.178*); a negative correlation was found between active coping strategies and the overall mood of Chinese students (-0.325**). Conclusions: Chinese students studying in China and abroad do not show the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder and prefer active strategies for coping with stress, related to pandemia COVID-19.

AB This study determined the effects of wheat stage, preservation treatment, and harvest time on the fermentation characteristics, methane production, and bacterial diversity. In this study, processing wheat into hay can reduce methane production. The MWS7 (wheat harvested at 7:00 in milk stage and preserved as silage) group had a significantly lower CO2 compared with the DWS15 (wheat harvested at 15:00 in dough stage and preserved as silage) group. Neutral detergent fiber degradation in the hay treatment harvesting at 7:00 was significantly higher than that in other treatments. The butyrate proportion in the DWH7 (wheat harvested at 7:00 in dough stage and preserved as hay) group was higher than that in the MWS7 group. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that there were differences in the relative abundance of some minor rumen microbiota among the treatments. The MWS7 group had greater microbial diversity and the MWH7 group (wheat harvested at 7:00 in milk stage and preserved as hay) had higher species richness. In addition, the MWH7 group had a lower Methanobrevibacter abundance and methane production. Overall, the MWH7 group may have advantages of rumen fermentation and reduce methane production.

AB To evaluate the relationship between spiritual experience and hysterical experiences in Buddhist participants in ethnic groups in China, this cross-sectional study recruited 39 participants aged 16-57 years old, and self-administered surveys were administered in two villages, one city and one town by four research assistants in the Inner Mongolia and Qinhai areas. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors associated with somatoform dissociation symptoms. Surveys were completed by 639 participants (mean age 31 years; 54.6% females) in 2017. Binary regression models showed that diverging from tradition and having a college education or above were associated with suffering from somatoform dissociation symptoms. By contrast, participants with higher experiences and older people were less likely to experience somatoform dissociation symptoms. Our current research highlights the contribution of spiritual experiences and traditional values to reducing somatization dissociation symptoms, and the findings could help to promote a new relationship between psychiatry and spiritual experiences that will benefit both mental health professionals and those who seek their assistance.

AB Oxygen is contributing to the deterioration of the beer and shortening the shelf-life of the packaged product. The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) on oxidative and structural characteristics of protein in beer during forced ageing was examined. Results showed that increased DO decreased obviously protein content in beer, and further reduced antioxidant activities of beer and lipid transfer protein 1 (LTP1). Meanwhile, the increase of DO decreased significantly the free thiol groups content and enhanced the disulfide bonds level in beer and LTP1. Results from circular dichroism, surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential illustrated that the increase of DO dramatically changed the secondary and tertiary structure of LTP1 with the decrease in the surface hydrophobicity, alpha-helix and beta-turn contents, and the increase in the random coil and negative zeta potential. These results indicated that increased DO could damage the structure of LTP1 and had a negative impact on oxidative stability of beer.

AB The blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus), the only species in the genusIthaginis, lives in an extremely inhospitable high-altitude environment, coping with hypoxia and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. To further investigate the phylogeny of Phasianidae species based on complete genomes and understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of the high-altitude adaptation of the blood pheasant, we de novo assembled and annotated the complete genome of the blood pheasant. The blood pheasant genome size is 1.04 Gb with scaffold N50 of 10.88 Mb. We identified 109.92 Mb (10.62%) repetitive elements, 279,037 perfect microsatellites, and 17,209 protein-coding genes. The phylogenetic tree of Phasianidae based on whole genomes revealed three highly supported major clades with the blood pheasant included in the "erectile clade." Comparative genomics analysis showed that many genes were positively selected in the blood pheasant, which was associated with response to hypoxia and/or UV radiation. More importantly, among these positively selected genes (PSGs) which were related to high-altitude adaptation, sixteen PSGs had blood pheasant-specific missense mutations. Our data and analysis lay solid foundation to the study of Phasianidae phylogeny and provided new insights into the potential adaptation mechanisms to the high altitude employed by the blood pheasant.

AB Potential energy curves of dipole moments for 12 electronic states correlating with the Se+((4)Su) H((2)Sg), Se+((2)Du) H((2)Sg) and Se+(Pu-2) H((2)Sg) dissociation channels of SeH+ anion are calculated by the is-MRCI + Q method. The AV5Z-DK basis set for Se atom and H atom are chosen. Scalar relativistic effect, core-valence correction, and spin-orbit coupling effect are also taken into account. In MRCI calculations, Se(1s2s) orbitals are frozen, H(1s) and Se(4s4p) orbitals are selected as active space, and the remaining orbitals are used for the core-valence correlation.
   Spectroscopic parameters of 12 Lambda-S states and 9 low-lying Omega states are obtained. All Lambda-S states we selected are bound states. The X-3 Sigma(-), a(1)Delta, b(1)Sigma(+), A(3)Pi and c(1)Pi states each possess a large well, but the others each have a shallow well. The a(1)Delta, b(1)Sigma(+), A(3)Pi, c(1)Pi and 1(5)Sigma(-) states cross in 30000-40000 cm(-1) regions. The X-3 Sigma(-), a(1)Delta and b(1)Sigma(+) come from the 4 pi(2) electronic configuration around the equilibrium region, and three states have similar values of R-e. The splitting dissociation channels are obtained at a spin-orbital coupling level. The calculated energy differences among five dissociation channels are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, and the maximal error is smaller than 0.5%. Due to the avoided crossing between the low-lying Omega states, the a2, b0(+), A(1)2, A(2)1, A(3)0(-), A(4)0(+) and c1 states all have two wells. The splitting parameters A(SO) of the X-3 Sigma(-) state and the A(3)Pi state are predicted at the same time, i. e. A(SO)(X(2)1 - X(1)0(+)) = 252.4 cm(-1), A(SO)(A(2)1 - A(1)2) = 858.9 cm(-1), A(SO)(A(3)0(-) - A(2)1) = 1213.5 cm(-1) and A(SO)(A(4)0(+) - A(3)0(-)) = 199.5 cm(-1). The transition dipole moments of the A(3)Pi <-> X-3 Sigma(-) and A(2)1 <-> X(1)0(+) transitions are obtained. The oscillator strengths, Franck-Condon factors, and radiative lifetimes of these two transitions are also predicted. The radiative lifetime of A(3)Pi state and A(2)1 state are 746.6 and 787.8 ns, respectively. It implies the ability of electron transition for these two transitions.

As a novel concept, P-strict feasibility for a bifunction variational inequality is introduced. Moreover, it is proved that a pseudomonotone bifunction variational inequality has a nonempty and bounded solution set if and only if it is P-strictly feasible in reflexive Banach spaces. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the validity of the main results.

AB Genetic modification provides a means to enhancing disease resistance in animals. In this study, the first generation of genetically modified (GM) sheep overexpressing TLR4 was produced by microinjection for better disease resistance. To compare semen characteristics including sperm quality, seminal plasma biochemical index, sperm DNA methylation and pregnancy rate of three-year old transgenic sheep with TLR4 overexpressed (toll like receptor 4, TLR4) and non-transgenic ram. Sixteen transgenic ram of F0 generation were produced by microinjection of the TLR4 plasmid into the pronucleus of fertilized ova. Seven transgenic sheep of F1 generation was produced by breeding F0 transgenic founders with non-transgenic sheep of the same breed. There were no significant differences between transgenic and control rams for all semen quality parameters, including semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm viability, and percentages of sperm with an intact plasma membrane, acrosomal integrity, and viable sperm with high mitochondrial membrane potential in both F0 and F1 generation. Furthermore, no significant differences were found for seminal plasma concentrations of zinc, neutral alpha-glucosidase, acid phosphatase or fructose, nor for levels of H19 and IGF2R methylation in sperm DNA. In addition, pregnancy rate was also similar between these two groups. In conclusion, there was no evidence that TLR4 overexpression altered the sperm quality, seminal plasma or sperm DNA of transgenic sheep. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the sustainable development of mobile communication technology and the increasing demand for indoor services, Location-based Service (LBS) is attracting more and more attention. Determining the mobile target's location is a core problem of LBS. The traditional WiFi signal fingerprint-based positioning technology mainly determines the location information of the mobile target by received RSS, which has high real-time positioning but low positioning accuracy. The fingerprint-based positioning technology using image mainly determines the location information of the mobile target by matching the features of the foreground images, which has the high positioning accuracy but low real-time positioning. This paper presents an indoor positioning method fusing information of the WiFi signal and RGB image to improve the positioning performance. The WiFi signal is transformed into the W-image according to indoor space and correction radius parameters, then the W-image and RGB image information are fused with LBP feature by the uniform-LBP algorithm. Afusion positioning model based on the sparse representation is established and solved using Lasso and BPDN positioning method. The positioning methods are tested in manufacturing workshop, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the complexity of the positioning method and achieve the higher positioning accuracy under same conditions.

AB In quantum swarm intelligence algorithms, the tunneling effect of the particles is determined by the potential energy acting on the particles. The tunneling effect of the particles affects the global search ability and convergence speed of the algorithm. Quantum algorithms with a single potential energy are prone to premature convergence under certain complex test functions. In this paper, we propose a multiscale quantum gradual approximation algorithm (MQGAA), which simply uses different approximation strategies to obtain different potential energy functions, to solve the premature problem of the optimization algorithm. In the MQGAA, particles undergo a transition from an unconstrained state to a constrained state at each scale. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out with several common and effective stochastic algorithms on N-dimensional double-well potential functions and classical benchmark functions. We also use the Wilcoxon rank test to detect the performance of MQGAA. The experimental results show that the algorithm using a step-by-step approximation strategy achieves a better optimization performance on some complex test functions.

DE Nardostachys jatamansi; traditional medicine; elemental concentration;
   ICP-OES; biosafety; quality
AB Background: Nardostachys jatamansi DC. is indigenous to the Himalayan regions of India and Tibetan plateau of China, and widely used as drugs for treating various neurological disorders, insomnia, hysteria and depressive illness. However, beyond the huge efforts to the organic components in N. jatamansi, the elemental contents have not been investigated, which are important for the quality control and biosafety evaluation of N. jatamansi.
   Objective: In this study, we quantified the element concentrations in N. jatamansi.
   Methods: Twenty-five N. jatamansi samples were collected in Sichuan, Tibet, Qinghai and Gansu provinces. The samples were digested and subjected to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) measurements.
   Results: The results indicated that Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pd, Si, Sr, Ti and Zn were detected in N. jatamansi samples. The chemometrics approaches indicated that N. jatamansi samples from Sichuan and Tibet shared similar elemental patterns. The altitude did not statistically influence the elemental patterns of N. jatamansi samples, while the K, P, Ba and Cd showed meaningful decreases. The high Ba contents in all samples suggested the potential toxicity of heavy metal to patients.
   Conclusion: The inorganic element quantification of N. jatamansi is useful in the genuine regional drug identification, quality control and biosafety evaluations.

AB This paper proposes a Hilbert stereo reconstruction algorithm based on depth feature and stereo matching to solve the problem of occlusive region matching errors, namely, the Hilbert stereo network. The traditional stereo network pays more attention to disparity itself, leading to the inaccuracy of disparity estimation. Our design network studies the effective disparity matching and refinement through reconstruction representation of Hilbert's disparity coefficient. Since the Hilbert coefficient is not affected by the occlusion and texture in the image, stereo disparity matching can conducted effectively. Our network includes three sub-modules, namely, depth feature representation, Hilbert cost volume fusion, and Hilbert refinement reconstruction. Separately, texture features of different depth levels of the image were extracted through Hilbert filtering operation. Next, stereoscopic disparity fusion was performed, and then Hilbert designed to refine the difference regression stereo matching solution was used. Based on the end-to-end design, the structure is refined by combining the depth feature extraction module and Hilbert coefficient disparity. Finally, the Hilbert stereo matching algorithm achieves excellent performance on standard big data set and is compared with other advanced stereo networks. Experiments show that our network has high accuracy and high performance.

AB The viewpoint that sacred religious texts related to prosocial values may facilitate prosocial tendencies has many proponents. However, many sacred texts addressing fundamental doctrines are unrelated to prosocial values. In this study, the Muslims participating in the trust game learned texts excerpted from the Quran and the Hadith. These texts focus only on glorifying Allah and are unrelated to prosocial morality. This property of the sample allowed us to examine whether sacred texts of this kind could facilitate Muslims' trust and trustworthiness. The results revealed that: (1) although the Muslims showed trust and trustworthiness to others, learning sacred texts glorifying Allah had no effect on either of these characteristics; and (2) unconditional kindness and reciprocity could explain trust and trustworthiness, but learning texts of this kind could not facilitate these prosocial tendencies by affecting their function. The results of this study could contribute to a more complete understanding of how sacred texts may affect prosociality.

In this paper, a constructive proof based on the method called ladder technique is presented. A practical example is proposed to illustrate that this method can be used to prove some hard inequalities on ternary quartic forms.

AB Soil moisture is a central theme in eco-hydrology. Topography, soil characteristics, and vegetation types are significant factors impacting soil moisture dynamics. However, water loss (evapotranspiration and leakage) and its factors of the self-organized vegetation pattern are not clear, which has significant ecologic functions and contributes to different hydrological ecosystem services. From an eco-hydrological point of view, we relied on the observation of rainfall, soil moisture, and soil temperature in the growing season of a drought year to compare soil moisture and temperature dynamics in terms of frequency/probability distribution and water loss among three typical vegetation types in the Qilian Mountains, China. The results indicated that shrubland (the semi-shaded slope) had the highest average soil moisture at the surface soil (0-40 cm) and soil profile during the growing season, while grassland (the south-facing slope) had the lowest daily average soil moisture and highest daily average soil temperature at the surface soil and soil profile. Spruce forest (the shaded slope) had the lowest daily average soil temperature at the surface soil and soil profile (p < 0.001). Water loss among the three vegetation types has a clear positive relationship with soil water content and a negative relationship with soil temperature. The values of water loss between values of water loss at the wilting point and maximum evapotranspiration point tend to occur in wetter soil moisture under the spruce forest and shrubland, whereas that of grassland emerges in drier soil moisture. The spruce forest and shrubland experienced higher water loss than the grassland. Although the spruce forest and shrubland had a better capacity to retain soil water, they also consumed more soil water than the grassland. Soil moisture may be the main factor controlling the difference in water loss among the three vegetation types. These findings may contribute to improving our understanding of the relationship between the soil moisture dynamics and vegetation pattern, and may offer basic insights for ecosystem management for upstream water-controlled mountainous areas.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB With the application of wireless sensor networks in the fields of ecological observation, defense military, architecture and urban management etc., the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Characteristics and constraint conditions of wireless sensor networks such as computing power, storage space and battery have brought huge challenges to protection research. Inspired by the danger theory in biological immune system, this paper proposes an intrusion detection model for wireless sensor networks. The model abstracts expressions of antigens and antibodies in wireless sensor networks, defines meanings and functions of danger signals and danger areas, and expounds the process of intrusion detection based on the danger theory. The model realizes the distributed deployment, and there is no need to arrange an instance at each sensor node. In addition, sensor nodes trigger danger signals according to their own environmental information, and do not need to communicate with other nodes, which saves resources. When danger is perceived, the model acquires the global knowledge through node cooperation, and can perform more accurate real-time intrusion detection. In this paper, the performance of the model is analyzed including complexity and efficiency, and experimental results show that the model has good detection performance and reduces energy consumption.

AB Effects and correlation analysis of four typical thermal treatment modes on milk stability and the subsequent quality of fermented milk were investigated. The hydrophobicity and the sulfuryl content of the heated milk showed obvious augment trend with the elevated heat temperature. Fermented milk from thermal treatments of 85 degrees C for 15 s or 120 degrees C for 15 s exhibited significantly higher viscosity, hardness and WHC, lower acetaldehyde or diacetyl content, and significantly less scores for smell and taste evaluation. The results suggested that stability changes of raw milk still had a significant effect on the physicochemical characteristics, sensory and texture properties, and flavor compounds of subsequent fermented milk. Medium pasteurization (85 degrees C for 15 s) or low pasteurization (65 degrees C for 30 min) could be practical for the production of fermented milk products based on the comprehensive consideration of milk stability, texture, flavor and the sensory evaluation.

TI An acceptability judgment study of 1+1 NN compounds in Chinese

LA English
DT Article
DE NN compounds; Length patterns; Elastic words; Judgment; Acceptability
AB Chinese 1+1 NNs refer to compounds made of two monosyllabic nouns, such as shu-bao 'book-bag' and ji-dan 'chicken-egg'. They occur frequently, do not violate any prosodic constraint, and appear to be highly productive. However, in Qin and Duanmu (2017), it was found that the mean acceptability ranking was quite low for randomly constructed 1+1 NNs. Since the focus of Qin and Duanmu (2017) was on a different issue, the set of 1+1 NNs was small and not of balanced design. In this study, we gathered acceptability scores from 17 Chinese native speakers on 1000 randomly constructed 1+1 NNs. It is found that the mean acceptability score is only 22.6%, even lower than that of Qin and Duanmu (2017). In addition, while Qin and Duanmu (2017) found ambiguity, naturalness, and frequency to have significant effects on acceptability scores, the present study did not find ambiguity to be relevant. We also found that 1+1 NNs consisting of two elastic nouns are significantly less acceptable than those consisting of one or two non-elastic nouns, although the effect size is rather small. Possible reasons for the low acceptability of 1+1 NN compounds are discussed, including semantic transparency, grammatical relations between the two nouns of a compound, and modern vs. classic vocabulary.

AB While software-defined networking (SDN) has been widely applied in various networking domains including datacenters, WANs (Wide Area Networks), QoS (Quality of Service) provisioning, service function chaining, etc., it also has foreseeable applications in energy internet (EI), which envisions an intelligent energy industry on the basis of (information) internet. Global awareness provided by SDN is especially useful in system monitoring in EI to achieve optimal energy transportation, sharing, etc. Link layer discovery protocol (LLDP) plays a key role in global topology discovery in software-defined energy internet when SDN is applied. Nevertheless, EI-related status information (power loads, etc.) is not collected during the LLDP-based topology discovery process initiated by the SDN controller, which makes the optimal decision making (e.g., efficient energy transportation and sharing) difficult. This paper proposes MonLink, a piggyback status-monitoring scheme over LLDP in software-defined energy internet with SDN-equipped control plane and data plane. MonLink extends the original LLDP by introducing metric type/length/value (TLV) fields so as to collect status information and conduct status monitoring in a piggyback fashion over LLDP during topology discovery simultaneously without the introduction of any newly designed dedicated status monitoring protocol. Several operation modes are derived for MonLink, namely, periodic MonLink, which operates based on periodic timeouts, proactive MonLink, which operates based on explicit API invocations, and adaptive MonLink, which operates sensitively and self-adaptively to status changes. Various northbound APIs are also designed so that upper layer network applications can make full use of the status monitoring facility provided by MonLink. Experiment results indicate that MonLink is a lightweight protocol capable of efficient monitoring of topological and status information with very low traffic overhead, compared with other network monitoring schemes such as sFlow.

AB We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to fully investigate the rash and pruritus of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in cancer patients. The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were retrieved, and a systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published up to April 2018. Nineteen randomized controlled trials and 11,006 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of PD-1 inhibitors significantly increases the risk of developing the all-grade rash (risk ratio [RR] 1.41; 95%CI 1.14-1.76; P = .002) and pruritus (RR 1.77; 95%CI 1.26-2.49; P = .001), and there was no difference between high-grade rash and pruritus. The RR of all-grade rash and pruritus did not vary significantly according to the type of drug, type of cancer, the line of therapy, or the treatment regimen. But both all-grade rash and pruritus varied significantly according to control therapy. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of PD-1 inhibitors significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade rash and pruritus. Physicians should be aware of these adverse events and should monitor cancer patients who are receiving PD-1 inhibitors.

AB Phytoremediation is a promising, low-cost and environmentally friendly technology. By simulating different concentrations of Pb, Pb+Zn and Pb+EDTA in aqueous solutions, taking Acorus calamus, Eichhornia crassipes and Iris tectorum as experimental material, hydroponics was used to study the enrichment of aquatic plants to Pb in water under different conditions. The results show that Eichhornia crassipes has the best bioconcentration capacity, Acorus calamus has good bioconcentration and Iris tectorum has weak bioconcentration. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) are more than 1 and the BCFs of the underground parts are greater than that of the aboveground parts. However, the translocation factors (TFs) are less than 1. The presence of Zn enhances the enrichment of the aquatic plants to Pb. The presence of EDTA reduces the enrichment, but promotes the transfer of Pb from underground parts to aboveground parts. All of the conclusions can provide reference for the application of aquatic plants for Phytoremediation of Pb.

AB Objective: To investigate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of cucurbitacin I on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
   Methods: HepG2, QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture medium under suitable conditions. HepG2, QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cultured with cucurbitacin I at different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L and 10 mol/L) for 12 and 36 hours respectively. The activity of HepG2, QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721 cells was detected by CCK-8 method. HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were treated and cultured in cucurbitacin I medium containing different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L, 10 mol/L). After Hoechst 33343 staining, the cloning formation of HepG2 cells was observed by clone formation assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Detection of anti-apoptotic factors by Western blot.
   Results: Compared with the control group, the activity of HepG2, QGY-7703 and SMMC-7721 cells cultured with cucurbitacin I at different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L and 10 mol/L) decreased significantly after 12 and 36 hours (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the cloning rate of HepG2 cells treated with cucurbitacin I at different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L and 10 mol/L) was significantly lower (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, HepG2 cells were treated with cucurbitacin I at different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L, 10 mol/L). With the increase of cucurbitacin I concentration, there were chromatin shrinkage and cell nucleolysis in HepG2 cells, which aggravated cell apoptosis. The levels of anti-apoptotic factors Mcl-1, survivin, p-STAT3 (Y705) and STAT3 in HepG2 cells treated with cucurbitacin I at different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 5.5 mol/L and 10 mol/L) were significantly decreased.
   Conclusion: Cucurbitacin I can aggravate apoptosis by reducing the level of anti-apoptotic factors, thus inhibiting the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

AB We used the density functional theory (DFT) with the unrestricted B3LYP exchange-correlation potential and LanL2DZ basis sets to optimize the geometries of SbnAl and SbnAl (+/- 1) (n = 1-10) clusters. We mainly utilized Gaussian 03 W software to calculate the data. In order to find the most stable structure of each isomer, we calculated the total energy, the spin multiplicity (S), point group symmetry (PG), the electronic state (State), and the average bond lengths of Sb-Al bond and Sb-Sb bond (R-1 and R-2). Through the calculations and analysis of these data, we found the ground state structure of each group isomer. By discussing the average binding energy (E-b), fragmentation energy (E-f), and the second-order energy difference (Delta E-2), the stabilities of the SbnAl ((0, +/- 1)) clusters were studied. The results of the electron transfer show that the Sb4Al and Sb8Al clusters are different with the other neutral clusters. In order to study the electric properties of SbnAl ((0, +/- 1)) clusters, the energy gap (E-g) between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), AEA, VDE, AIP, and VIP were calculated. Besides, the magnetic moment of the positive and negative clusters have the same effects when n = 2-9.

ID DISTRIBUTED ESTIMATION
AB Decentralized estimation fusion based on quantized local estimates is investigated. Motivated by the fact that the variance of quantization noise suffers from bounded uncertainty, we address the robust quantized estimation fusion problem in energy constrained wireless sensor networks. The quantization levels and fusion weights are jointly determined by minimizing worst-case of mean squared error of fused estimate among the uncertainties. Moreover, the effects of observation noise correlations on the fusion performance is explored by considering three different correlation scenarios. The optimal solution of the proposed robust fusion problem in each scenario is derived, in a closed-form or by solving a semidefinite programming. Theoretical analysis indicates that if the correlations exist, the fusion performance might improve or degrade, depending on correlation structure. However, appropriate usage of the correlations in fusion center can asymptotically improve the estimation fusion performance. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the theoretical analysis, and the results illustrate the good performance of the proposed method. (C) 018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tibetan Plateau has an extremely harsh and cold climate and scarce natural resources but abundant solar energy. Optimisation of thermal design for buildings is highly essential for indoor thermal comfort improvement and energy efficiency of buildings. In this paper a modified heat transfer model of building envelopes in Tibetan Plateau is established, considering locally unique climatic features. Furthermore, the influence of low air density on convection is analysed and heat transfer correction factor is used to evaluate the effects of solar and long-wave radiations on external walls of buildings from different directions. The results show that the convection coefficients decline with rising elevation and heat-transfer correction factor decreases with increasing solar radiation. It also indicates that by aiming at minimising overall heat loss, the optimal thermal resistance of each external wall should be in positive proportion to the square root of its heat-transfer correction factor. A case study in Lhasa illustrates that inserting thermal insulation materials into the external walls can significantly improve indoor thermal comfort. Compared to balanced thermal insulation, the integrated uncomfortable degree of unbalanced thermal insulation can be reduced by about 20% after optimisation. This work is important for guiding the practical thermal design of buildings in plateau areas.

AB We investigate and experimentally demonstrate the impact of continuous wave (CW) injection from a malicious ONU on the upstream transmission in a power splitting-based PON. Both OOK signal as used in a TDM-PON and OFDM signal in an OFDM-PON are considered. In our experiment, 10-Gb/s NRZ-PRBS and OFDM signals were used to test the effect of CW injection in TDM-PON and OFDM-PON, respectively. A bit error rate floor is observed for the upstream OOK signal when the signal-to-crosstalk ratio is reduced to 7.7 dB. Similarly, the CW injection from a malicious ONU also impose severe power penalty to the upstream OFDM signal. To overcome this security issue, we propose a novel protection scheme via harvesting the optical energy at the remote node (RN) that is originally wasted in a common power splitting-based PON. The proposed protection scheme can maintain the passive nature of the RN.

TI Time-aware service-classified spectrum defragmentation algorithm for
   flex-grid optical networks
SO OPTICAL FIBER TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID PATH NETWORK; ASSIGNMENT; EFFICIENT; ALLOCATION
AB By employing sophisticated routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithms together with a finer spectrum granularity (namely frequency slot) in resource allocation procedures, flex-grid optical networks can accommodate diverse kinds of services with high spectrum-allocation flexibility and resource-utilization efficiency. However, the continuity and the contiguity constraints in spectrum allocation procedures may always induce some isolated, small-sized, and unoccupied spectral blocks (known as spectrum fragments) in flex-grid optical networks. Although these spectrum fragments are left unoccupied, they can hardly be utilized by the subsequent service requests directly because of their spectral characteristics and the constraints in spectrum allocation. In this way, the existence of spectrum fragments may exhaust the available spectrum resources for a coming service request and thus worsens the networking performance. Therefore, many reactive defragmentation algorithms have been proposed to handle the fragmented spectrum resources via re-optimizing the routing paths and the spectrum resources for the existing services. But the routing-path and the spectrum-resource re-optimization in reactive defragmentation algorithms may possibly disrupt the traffic of the existing services and require extra components. By comparison, some proactive defragmentation algorithms (e.g. fragmentation-aware algorithms) were proposed to suppress spectrum fragments from their generation instead of handling the fragmented spectrum resources. Although these proactive defragmentation algorithms induced no traffic disruption and required no extra components, they always left the generated spectrum fragments unhandled, which greatly affected their efficiency in spectrum defragmentation. In this paper, by comprehensively considering the characteristics of both the reactive and the proactive defragmentation algorithms, we proposed a time-aware service-classified (TASC) spectrum defragmentation algorithm, which simultaneously employed proactive and reactive mechanisms in suppressing spectrum fragments with the awareness of services' types and their duration times. By dividing the spectrum resources into several flexible groups according to services' types and limiting both the spectrum allocation and the spectrum re-tuning for a certain service inside one specific spectrum group according to its type, the proposed TASC defragmentation algorithm cannot only suppress spectrum fragments from generation inside each spectrum group, but also handle the fragments generated between two adjacent groups. In this way, the proposed TASC algorithm gains higher efficiency in suppressing spectrum fragments than both the reactive and the proactive defragmentation algorithms. Additionally, as the generation of spectrum fragments is retrained between spectrum groups and the defragmentation procedure is limited inside each spectrum group, the induced traffic disruption for the existing services can be possibly reduced. Besides, the proposed TASC defragmentation algorithm always re-tunes the spectrum resources of the service with the maximum duration time first in spectrum defragmentation procedure, which can further reduce spectrum fragments because of the fact that the services with longer duration times always have higher possibility in inducing spectrum fragments than the services with shorter duration times.
   The simulation results show that the proposed TASC defragmentation algorithm can significantly reduce the number of the generated spectrum fragments while improving the service blocking performance.

AB Hide or skin, a by-product of the meat industry, is composed of collagen fibers with tight network. Tanning is the process which converts the waste hide into useful artefacts, such as sofa and automotive cushion, shoes, bags and garment. Although several types of tanning methods have employed for tanning of hide, chrome tanning which endow leather unparalleled properties are still considered as the most popular in the leather industry worldwide. Generally, only 60-80% of the offering chrome is effectively utilized and chrome-contained leather shavings and effluent is discharge into the environment, which triggers to severe environmental pollution. Hence, finding a sustainable solution to reduce chrome disposal is a prime challenge for global tanners and researchers. This review focuses the methodology of cleaner chrome tanning, that is, integrated chrome tanning process, high exhaustion agents or auxiliaries based on chemical materials are discussed in this review.

AB To enhance the piezoelectric properties and maintain relatively higher Curie temperature (T-C), (1-x)K0.48Na0.52NbO3-xBi(0.45)Nd(0.05)(Na0.92Li0.08)(0.5)ZrO3 ((1-x) KNN-xBNNLZ) ceramics were prepared by conventional solid-state method. The effects of BNNLZ content on the phase structure and electrical properties of the ceramics were investigated in details. The results show that all ceramic samples exhibit higher T-C (>300 degrees C). With the increase of BNNLZ content, both orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition temperature (TO-T) and rhombohedral-orthorhombic phase transition temperatures (TR-O) shift to room temperature simultaneously, and finally the R-T phase coexistence is constructed near room temperature in the compositions range of 0.05<x<0.07. The phase transitions of the ceramics caused by BNNLZ addition lead to values of d(33), epsilon(r), P-r, and k(p) increase firstly and then decrease. The ceramic with x=0.06 exhibits optimal properties: d(33)=313 pC/N, k(p)=42%, P-r=25.48 mu C/cm(2), epsilon(r)=1353, tan delta=2.5%, together with a higher T-C of 327 degrees C.

TI An incremental anomaly detection model for virtual machines
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; SYSTEM
AB Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm as an unsupervised learning method has been applied in anomaly detection due to its capabilities of self-organizing and automatic anomaly prediction. However, because of the algorithm is initialized in random, it takes a long time to train a detection model. Besides, the Cloud platforms with large scale virtual machines are prone to performance anomalies due to their high dynamic and resource sharing characters, which makes the algorithm present a low accuracy and a low scalability. To address these problems, an Improved Incremental Self-Organizing Map (IISOM) model is proposed for anomaly detection of virtual machines. In this model, a heuristic-based initialization algorithm and a Weighted Euclidean Distance (WED) algorithm are introduced into SOM to speed up the training process and improve model quality. Meanwhile, a neighborhood based searching algorithm is presented to accelerate the detection time by taking into account the large scale and high dynamic features of virtual machines on cloud platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness, experiments on a common benchmark KDD Cup dataset and a real dataset have been performed. Results suggest that IISOM has advantages in accuracy and convergence velocity of anomaly detection for virtual machines on cloud platform.

AB This article addresses the robust analysis on a delayed system with uncertainties. A geometric sequence division (GSD) method is applied for delay partition. Then, a GSD-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is newly proposed, in which the integral interval relevant with the state variables forms in geometric progression. In addition, by applying the convex combination method, parameter uncertainties and the delay derivative d. (t) can thus be flexibly overcome. As a result, unnecessary enlargement for estimating the LKF derivative is eliminated. Numerical example shows that this proposed work achieves expected results.

The modulation depth of downstream differential phase-shift keying is properly reduced to facilitate phase remodulation and Rayleigh noise mitigation.

ID MULTIUSER MIMO SYSTEMS; FADING CHANNELS; EFFICIENCY
AB We study the optimal precoding for a full-duplex (FD) system, where one FD multi-antenna base station (BS) respectively transmits to and receives from two half-duplex single-antenna mobile users (MUs) on the same time slot and frequency band. At the FD BS, the received signal from the desired MU is severely affected by the extremely strong self-interference (SI) from its transmit antennas to the receive antennas. In the presence of residual SI after imperfect SI cancellation, the downlink transmission rate maximization problem subject to a targeted uplink rate is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem to characterize the achievable rate region for the considered system. Considering the case in which the SI channel is strongly correlated, the above problem is transformed into a convex problem by exploiting the rank-one property of the SI channel, which can be solved efficiently. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB We propose and experimentally demonstrate a multicast-enabled survivable architecture for wavelength- division-multiplexed passive optical networks. By manipulating the sinusoidal control clock and the wavelength of the light source for each downstream wavelength channel at the optical line terminal, different optical subcarriers are generated to provide subscribers with not only multicast data transmission but also survivability against fiber failure in either distribution or feeder fibers. The simultaneous transmissions of 10-Gb/s unicast data and 10-Gb/s multicast data under normal working mode, as well as the 10-Gb/s transmissions for unicast data under protection mode, are experimentally demonstrated.

AB This paper proposes a Trajectory-Based Hierarchical Adaptive Forwarding (THAF) scheme, tailored and optimized for the efficient multihop vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) data delivery in vehicular ad hoc networks. We utilize the trajectories of vehicles provided by GPS-based navigation systems to predict forward delay and access area in a privacy-preserving manner. Different from existing trajectory-based forwarding schemes, we establish a hierarchical VANET topology to optimize forwarding path and adopt adaptive diffusion strategy to forward data in light-traffic situations. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that our design performs better than the existing schemes.

AB We investigate the portfolio diversification problem by maximizing the risk adjusted return (RAR) of the underlying portfolio. The model in this article has two primary advantages over the original portfolio selection model with maximal RAR: (1) it considers the set of available assets containing any number of assets instead of only two assets, which is more reasonable in practical applications and (2) it incorporates the general linear constraint other than the simple budget constraint, which can deal with additional constraints for rational investors. An application including in-sample and out-of-sample tests is provided where the results illustrate that the portfolios selected by our method lead to considerable increases of RAR in comparison with those by the minimization of variance approach, and the outperformance persists using different sample frequencies.

AB Cadmium (Cd) is a demonstrated pollutant in the aquatic environment. The bioaccumulation of Cd in fish affects the mitochondrial viability such as free radicals generation and lipid peroxidation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma co-activator a (PGC-1 alpha) is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. However, only a few PGC-1 alpha s have been identified in fish, and their functions remain obscure. In the present study, PGC-1 alpha gene was cloned from Ctenopharyngodon idellus (grass carp). Sequencing analysis revealed that grass carp PGC-1 alpha also contained a PPAR. binding site, a RNA recognition motif and several serine-arginine repeats like other PGC-1 alpha s, suggesting a similar function of PGC-1 alpha in grass carp compared with that in mammals. PGC-1 alpha expression was mainly observed in tissues with high content of mitochondria such as kidney and red muscle, then heart>brain> white muscle> liver > adipose. When the fish were exposed to cadmium for 24h, 5 mu M cadmium promoted mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity and PGC-1 alpha expression enhancement. While 20 mu M cadmium slightly raised the enzyme activity, which was consistent with PGC-1 alpha expression increment. These results suggested that grass carp PGC-1 alpha was involved in cadmium induced stress and it may be associated with mitochondrial function.

AB Due to the porous structure and hydrophobicity, graphene sponge has huge adsorption capacity for oils and organic solvents. In this study, we reported that graphene sponge could be prepared by vapor phase reduction (denoted as VPRGS) for oil and organic solvent removal. Graphene oxide was lyophilized and reduced by steamy hydrazine hydrate to produce VPRGS. VPRGS had huge capacity for oils and organic solvents (72-224 g g(-1)). In particular, the adsorption capacity for crude oil reached 165 g g(-1), suggesting that VPRGS could be applied in oil leakage remediation. VPRGS could treat pollutants both in pure liquid form and in the simulated sea water, where the hydrophobic nature of VPRGS allowed the floating of VPRGS on simulated sea water. VPRGS could be easily regenerated without obvious capacity loss up to 9 cycles. The implications to the applications of VPRGS in oil/water separation and water remediation are discussed.

AB This paper presents improved stability results by introducing a new delay partitioning method based on the theory of geometric progression to deal with T-S fuzzy systems in the appearance of interval time-varying delays and nonlinear perturbations. A common ratio alpha is applied to split the delay interval into multiple unequal subintervals. A modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed with triple-integral terms and augmented factors including the length of every subintervals. In addition, the recently developed free-matrix-based integral inequality is employed to combine with the extended reciprocal convex combination and free weight matrices techniques for avoiding the overabundance of the enlargement when deducing the derivative of the LKF. Eventually, this developed research work can efficiently obtain the maximum upper bound of the time-varying delay with much less conservatism. Numerical results are conducted to illustrate the remarkable improvements of this proposed method.

AB Spongy graphene has been widely applied in oil removal. However, spongy graphene is hardly applicable for crude oil removal, because the complexity and high viscosity of crude oil. Herein, we reported that graphene/polyester staple composite (GPSC) could be used for the removal of oils and organic solvents, in particular crude oil. Graphene oxide was in situ reduced in the presence of polyester staple by hydrazine hydrate to form GPSC. GPSC efficiently adsorbed oils and organic solvents with high adsorption capacities. Demonstrations of treating pure oils and those in simulated sea water by GPSC were successfully performed. Due to the loose structure, GPSC adsorbed crude oil quickly with an adsorption capacity of 52 g g(-1). During the regeneration, the adsorption capacity of GPSC retained around 78% of the initial capacity up to 9 cycles. The implication to the applications of GPSC in water remediation is discussed.

DE NIRS; Elymus sibiricus; CP; NDF; IVDMD
AB Siberian wildrye (Elymus sibiricus L.) is one of the predominant pasture species in Qinghai-Tibet plateau of China. It supplies a large number of kidders to domestic animals in spring and winter, and provides a large proportion of the summer and autumn grazing in these alpine regions. Crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) are the most important aspects of nutritive value of forages. A successful application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with partial least square regression (PLSR) for the determination of four parameters (CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD) of Siberian wildrye was developed. The standard errors of calibration (SEC, %DM) and R-cal(2) values (in parentheses) were 0.329 9(0. 994 5), 0.779 9(0. 949 9), 1.343 0(0. 913 3), and 1.376 2 (0. 982 2) for CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD equations, respectively. The standard errors of prediction (SEP, %DM) and R-val(2) values (in parentheses) were 0. 362 1(0. 993 8), 0. 787 8(0. 944 9), 1. 385 2.(0. 890 7), and 1. 430 3(0. 979 0) for CP, ADF, NDF and IVDMD, respectively. A good correlation (r>0. 943 8) was found between results from NIRS and the traditional chemical method, and residual predictive deviation (RPD) ranged from 3. 02 to 12. 63. It was concluded that NIR spectroscopic technique associated with chemometrics is sufficiently sensitive to allow the accurate prediction of the concentrations of components (CP, ADF and NDF) and IVDMD of Siberian wildrye.

AB The most stable (Al16Ti)(n +/-) (n=0-3) ions were modeled and optimized using density functional theory combined with all-electron spin-polarized calculations. The geometries, stabilities, and electronic structures of the (Al16Ti)(n +/-) (n=0-3) ionic clusters, as well as the adsorption structures and adsorption energies of H2O molecules on the (Al16Ti)(n +/-) (n=0-3) ionic clusters, were studied. The results were compared with those obtained for pure (Al-17)(n +/-) (n=0-3) ionic clusters. The spatial distributions of the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals for the (Al16Ti)(n +/-) (n=0-3) ionic clusters showed that the free electrons tend to occupy Ti sites. And a few residual free electrons would occupy sites with large curvatures. An extensive structure search was performed to identify the low-energy conformations of (Al16TiH2O)(n +/-) (n=0-3) complexes. Based on the geometries of the studied adsorption complexes, it was found that the most stable structures were prone to oxygen-based adsorption onto Ti atom. (Al16TiH2O)(+) ion featured the shortest average O-H bond length, that was similar to 0.0003 nm longer than that observed in isolated H2O molecule. The O-H bond length increased with either increasing or decreasing number of the electrons. The studies implied that Ti dopant in Al ionic clusters improved the dissociation efficiency of H2O molecules. Furthermore, the doping effect played a more important role than the geometry effect in determining the electronic structures of the (Al16Ti)(n) ionic clusters and their interaction with H2O molecules.

AB Four new derivatives of p-t-butylcalix[4]arene containing two (1,3-distal) chiral unsymmetrical urea moieties at the lower rim were synthesised in four steps. Their anion recognition properties toward MeCO2-, H2PO4-, NO3-, I-, Br-, Cl- were assessed by UV-Vis titration spectroscopy. All the receptors showed the strongest recognition ability for MeCO2-, one of them having an association constant of 3139 M-1. H-1 NMR studies of this receptor complex confirmed its tight binding of MeCO2-.

AB The influence of the wheel axle bending stiffness to the wheel/rail contact dynamic force and wheelset vertical vibration of the linear metro vehicle on a straight track was investigated. Based on a vehicle dynamic model and two kinds of elastic wheelset models, a comparison was carried out between the wheelset vertical vibration and the wheel/rail vertical force. Simulation results showed that the wheelset vibration and the wheel/rail vertical force of the elastic wheelset model were different with that of the rigid wheelset model; this was due to the BM3000 type wheelset not having high enough bending stiffness. In contrast, the result of the elastic wheelset model of the wheelset of the Beijing metro railway vehicle was quite similar to the results of the rigid model since a larger bending stiffness was used. Consequently, the wheelset vibration and wheel/rail vertical force can be decreased by increasing the wheel axle bending stiffness which will improve wheel/rail dynamic contact conditions.

AB We consider a continuous-time mean-variance asset-liability management problem in a market with random market parameters; that is, interest rate, appreciation rates, and volatility rates are considered to be stochastic processes. By using the theories of stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we tackle this problem and derive optimal investment strategies as well as the mean-variance efficient frontier analytically in terms of the solution of BSDEs. We find that the efficient frontier is still a parabola in a market with random parameters. Comparing with the existing results, we also find that the liability does not affect the feasibility of the mean-variance portfolio selection problem. However, in an incomplete market with random parameters, the liability can not be fully hedged.

AB The objective of this study was to compare 12 bp-duplication polymorphisms in exon 4 of the kappa-casein gene among 3 breeds/populations of yak (Bos grunniens). Genomic DNA was extracted from yak blood or muscle samples (N = 211) and a partial sequence of exon 4 of kappa-casein gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay of the products (169 bp) revealed 2 variants. These variants differed in a 12-bp duplication of the nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acids 147-150 (Glu-Ala-Ser-Pro) or 148-151 (Ala-Ser-Pro-Glu). The genotype frequency and gene frequency of the 2 kappa-casein variants differed among the 3 yak breeds/populations. The long form of the kappa-casein gene was the predominant allele, and the Jiulong yak showed the highest frequency of the short form variant of the kappa-casein gene. In addition, 2 nucleotide differences resulting in amino acid substitutions were also identified in yaks. These results are significant for designing a breeding strategy to improve the genetic makeup of yak herds.

AB The aim of this study was to detect the expression of GSK3B gene in different tissues of goats and the expression level of intramuscular precursor adipocytes at different differentiation periods, and to further reveal the effects of overexpression and interferences of GSK3B gene on lipid deposition in intramuscular precursor adipocytes of goats. The results showed that a nucleotide sequence of 1,433 bp, CDS region 1,263 bp, encoding 420 amino acids, was obtained for the goat GSK3B gene, Goat GSK3B gene expression was highest in the lungs, lowest in the longest dorsal muscle, and highest at 120 h of induced differentiation. Overexpression of GSK3B gene significantly reduced lipid droplets in intramuscular precursor adipocytes, and also significantly down-regulated the relative expression of SREBP1, CEBP beta and PPAR gamma (p < 0.05), with no significant changes in the expression of FASN, CEBP alpha, SCD and LPL (p > 0.05), GSK3B inhibition increased lipid droplets accumulation by significantly down-regulated SREBP1, CEBP beta and PPAR gamma expression (p < 0.05). In conclusion, GSK3B expression significantly inhibited lipid deposition in goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. These results provide important data to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating intramuscular fat formation in goats.

AB Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a prevalent pathogen implicated in canine infectious respiratory disease, yet information on its genomic characteristics and pathogenicity remains scarce. To address this situation, we investigated the genetic evolution and pathogenic potential of CRCoV strains circulating in China. Five complete CRCoV genomes (GenBank: PQ725948-PQ725952) were obtained from clinical samples, and phylogenetic analysis showed these strains formed a distinct genetic branch. The evolutionary trees for ORF1ab, HE, and S genes closely mirrored the full genome tree, indicating key roles for these genes in CRCoV evolution. Multiple unique amino acid mutations were identified in the ORF1ab, HE, S, M, and N proteins. Notably, molecular docking analysis suggests that mutations S158F and L161F in the HE lectin domain are associated with improved docking scores, indicating a potential increase in receptor-binding affinity. Consecutive nucleotide deletions in two non-coding regions between non-structural protein genes-which were also identified in strains of a Thai lineage (OQ621707.1-OQ621727.1)-were observed. A CRCoV strain (106 TCID50/mL) was isolated, and experimental infection confirmed its ability to induce pneumonia and tracheal cilia loss in dogs. These findings reveal the emergence and unique genetic diversity of a novel CRCoV variant in China, highlighting the need for ongoing epidemiological surveillance.

AB Bovine Nebovirus (BNeV) and Bovine Norovirus (BNoV) are major causes of viral diarrhea in calves, leading to significant economic losses. Currently, no commercial vaccines exist for these pathogens. Here, we developed bivalent virus-like particles (VLPs) co-expressing BNeV and BNoV VP1 proteins using a baculovirus-insect cell system and evaluated their immunogenicity in mice. Both monovalent (BNoV or BNeV VLPs) and bivalent VLPs induced peak IgG titers by day 14 post-booster, with the bivalent VLPs triggering faster antibody production. Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) blocking assays (BT50) showed that bivalent VLPs induced higher blocking antibody titers, peaking at day 14 and remaining elevated at day 28. Additionally, bivalent VLPs enhanced IFN-gamma secretion and increased CD3+CD8+ T-cell proportions. These findings demonstrate that BNeV-BNoV-VP1 bivalent VLPs effectively stimulate cellular immunity and blocking antibodies, supporting their potential as vaccines against BNeV and BNoV.

AB Global warming significantly impacts soil fauna in terrestrial ecosystems, yet the differential responses of various groups, such as surface-dwelling microarthropods, soil-dwelling microarthropods, and soil nematodes, remain poorly understood. To address this, a long-term warming experiment using open-top chambers (OTCs) was conducted in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Ten years after OTC installation, surface-dwelling, soil-dwelling microarthropods and soil nematodes, plant communities, and soil properties were investigated in September in the normal precipitation year 2019 and in the wet year 2020. The results were that: (1) shifts in taxonomic composition were more pronounced in surface-dwelling microarthropods and soil nematodes than in soil-dwelling microarthropods; (2) warming increased nematode taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity but reduced nematode abundance and surface-dwelling arthropod richness in the normal year, while only nematode abundance increased in the wet year; (3) warming altered nematode trophic structure by decreasing the relative abundance of bacterivores and increasing that of plant-parasites; (4) soil moisture and temperature were the primary drivers of soil faunal community changes, with ammonium nitrogen also being an important factor for soil nematodes. Our results demonstrate that the soil nematodes exhibited the strongest response to warming, followed by surface-dwelling and soil-dwelling microarthropods, and the warming effects on soil fauna abundance and diversity were dependent on precipitation. These taxon-specific sensitivities highlight their utility as bioindicators for monitoring alpine ecosystems.

AB Psychological stress significantly influences individual behavior and group dynamics during emergency evacuations, yet its mechanisms remain underexplored in non-standard settings such as high-altitude ethnic villages with complex spatial structures. This study takes Jiangdong Village in Ruoergai County, Sichuan Province, as a case. Based on field-collected psychological stress ratings and heart rate data, a regression function linking stress scores to walking speed was established and embedded into a multi-agent simulation model on the AnyLogic platform to simulate the evacuation of 223 individuals. Results show stress significantly increased average evacuation time (82.26 s to 100.95 s), maximum time (219.57 s to 369.87 s), and variability (coefficient of variation: 0.4078 to 0.4469). Spatial analysis revealed stress-induced congestion near intersections and shelter entrances. The study validates a stress-based evacuation modeling approach, reveals dynamic coupling in the stress-behavior-density chain, and provides quantitative evidence for optimizing shelter layout, route guidance, and behavioral interventions in high-risk ethnic village contexts.

   gastrointestinal simulation reveals lipidomic alterations
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE

DT Article
DE human milk; yak milk; gastrointestinal simulation; lipidomic alterations
AB Yak milk is considered an excellent dairy source for infant formula, owing to its lipid advantages including superior fatty acid composition, abundant short-and medium-chain fatty acids, and higher phospholipid content. This study compared the physical characteristics, lipidomic profiles, and fatty acid differences between human milk and yak milk digestion products through an in vitro simulation of infant digestion. The results revealed that human milk exhibited higher lipolysis rates and greater release of free fatty acids compared with yak milk. No significant differences were observed in the average particle size of fat globules or zeta potential between the 2 milk types at the same digestion stage. Distinctive differential metabolites identified during gastric digestion included triglyceride (TG; 18:1_18:1_18:2), TG (18:0_18:2_18:3), TG (16:0_18:1_20:4), TG (O-11: 0 _14: 0 _3: 0), and sphingomyelin (d36:1). In the intestinal digestion phase, monoglyceride (MG; P-21:6), MG (O-21:6), fatty acid (FA; 22:6), FA (20:4), FA (16:0), and FA (18:0) served as characteristic differential metabolites. Palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) served as critical discriminators of fatty acid profiles between yak milk and human milk digesta, predominantly via their enrichment in key metabolic pathways, including "Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids" and "Fatty acid biosynthesis." This could provide data support for the design of yak milk-based infant formula.

AB Topologically polar structures offer a rich landscape for uncovering emergent phenomena inaccessible in traditional ferroelectric materials. In contrast to the numerous examples found in ferroelectric oxides, topological structures identified in ferroelectric polymers are extremely rare. Here, the creation of a meron-like topological polar structure is demonstrated in the non-polar alpha-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The formation of the twisted lamellae within ring-banded polymer spherulites and the resulting topological structure are revealed using combined experimental and computational methods. Non-zero polarization is demonstrated using Kelvin probe force microscopy, second harmonic generation measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy, and verify the facilitation of polarization orientation by strain in the topological alpha-phase PVDF. Accordingly, piezoelectricity in the topological alpha-phase PVDF is demonstrated through both direct and converse measurements and reveals a strong correlation between polarization, the piezoelectric coefficient, and the topological structure. This result offers a new perspective on creating polar topological structures and inducing formerly symmetry-forbidden properties like piezoelectricity in the non-polar phase of ferroelectric polymers.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to fill the gap in existing literature regarding the impact of e-government reforms on corporate investment efficiency. Specifically, it explores how such reforms influence corporate investment behavior and performance, particularly in China's context.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses a quasi-natural experiment design, using the comprehensive e-government pilot policy implemented in China in 2018. A difference-in-differences (DID) model is used to empirically examine the policy's effects on corporate investment efficiency. The study investigates the mechanisms behind the reforms, focusing on alleviating financing constraints, reducing cash holdings, and mitigating underinvestment and overinvestment.FindingsThe study finds that e-government reforms significantly enhance corporate investment efficiency. Key mechanisms include alleviating financing constraints and reducing cash holdings. The reforms mitigate underinvestment and overinvestment behaviors and reduce the influence of government-business relations. The positive effects are more pronounced in cities with higher administrative ranks, advanced digital infrastructure, nonstate-owned enterprises, and firms with lower managerial capabilities.Originality/valueThis research offers a novel perspective by empirically analyzing the impact of e-government reforms on corporate investment efficiency, an area that has been underexplored in prior literature. The findings provide important policy insights for leveraging e-government reforms to improve investment efficiency in businesses across various contexts, particularly in China.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development and physiology of mammals. However, the role of superenhancer (SE)-associated circRNAs (SE-circRNAs) in adipogenesis remains largely unexplored. In this study, RNA and H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses of yak muscle tissues with varying IMF contents were performed, and 81 differentially expressed SE-circRNAs were identified in the high IMF (intramuscular fat) group. Among them, circRHOQ was notably associated with SEs, with H3K27ac signals enriched at its genomic locus. Enhancer activity assays identified two key regulatory regions (chr9:49134487-49135239 and chr9:49136018-49136614) with significant transcriptional activation. Treatment with JQ-1 suppressed circRHOQ expression, confirming that circRHOQ is an SE-driven regulatory circRNA. Functional assays validated that circRHOQ is a cytoplasmic circRNA that promotes yak intramuscular preadipocyte adipogenic differentiation, as indicated by the increased lipid accumulation, triacylglycerol content, and adipogenic gene expression. Mechanistically, circRHOQ acts as a competing endogenous RNA by binding to miR-5093, thereby derepressing its target IRF5 and promoting adipogenesis. Dual-luciferase assays validated the direct interactions among circRHOQ, miR-5093, and IRF5. This study revealed that circRHOQ promotes yak IMF development via the SE-circRHOQ/miR-5093/IRF5 axis, thus providing a basis for further investigation into IMF deposition and improvement of high-altitude livestock breeds.

AB This article addresses the challenge of enhancing the accuracy of sensor positioning in a wireless sensor network (WSN) by leveraging time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements from multiple disjoint sources. We present a novel sensor position refinement method based on the constrained weighted least squares (CWLSs) multisource localization algorithm, which yields more accurate estimates of source positions. Utilizing these improved estimates, we generate a set of nonlinear range measurements for each sensor. These new observations, combined with the available prior information about sensor locations, form the basis of our final sensor refinement formulation, which follows the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation strategy. Although the resulting optimization problem is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard, we develop an iterative algorithm to optimize the sensor positions that efficiently addresses this complexity. In addition, our proposed algorithm is designed for distributed implementation, ensuring compliance with real-time requirements. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in scenarios with moderately high TDOA noise levels or ill-conditioned geometry.

AB The linearization method is a fundamental tool for applying linear system theory to nonlinear systems and requires the vector field of the studied system to be differentiable. This paper investigates the local stabilization problem of discrete-time nonlinear systems with time-varying delays under event-triggered control, using the linearization method. Note that even if a system itself is differentiable, the closed-loop system is generally discontinuous due to the state jumps caused by event-triggering. The basic idea of this paper is to design an event-triggered state-feedback controller for the linearized system, thereby achieving ultimate stabilization of the original nonlinear system. For this purpose, the system is transformed into an equivalent delay-free switched system via the switching transformation method. Several sufficient conditions for local exponential stabilization of the original system are derived by constructing a quadratic switched Lyapunov function based on the equivalent switched system, and two kinds of delays are considered: Arbitrarily and slowly time-varying ones. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that the linearization method has been applied to event-triggered control. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the results proposed.

AB Based on China's city panel data from 2005 to 2020, this paper investigates the impact of high-speed rail connecting on environmental quality and its economic consequences. The results show that high-speed rail opening has a significant effect on the improvement of environmental quality and economic efficiency, and the regression results are highly robust. Meanwhile, there are three aspects of heterogeneity: The environmental pollution index of non-resource-based cities has decreased significantly, but the impact on resource-based cities is relatively small; The influence coefficient is significant in the central and western cities of China, but not in the eastern cities; Compared with developed cities, less developed cities show a more significant improvement effect. The mechanism test shows that high-speed rail makes the city more attractive to talents, and the entry of human capital improves the willingness of pollution control; High-speed rail connecting has significantly increased the investment of enterprises, and the entry cost of polluting enterprises has further increased; High-speed rail can significantly promote the decline of environmental pollution index through the increase of scientific research investment. In addition, the economic consequences test shows that high-speed rail improves environmental quality, innovation capacity and industrial structure while promotes the efficiency of economic development.

AB Interparental conflict is a well-established risk factor for adolescent well-being. However, the moderating role of teacher-student relationships on the longitudinal association between interparental conflict and adolescent well-being is unclear. Using a multilevel framework, this study employed a 4-wave longitudinal design over two years to examine the interaction between teacher-student relationships and interparental conflict in adolescent subjective well-being. Participants were 484 adolescents (Mage=14.33 years, SD = 1.62) from a secondary school in southwest China. The result indicated that adolescents who reported higher cumulative experiences of interparental conflicts also perceived significantly less subjective well-being than their peers who reported fewer conflicts in the past two years. Moreover, the teacher-student relationship at the between-person level buffered the adverse association of interparental conflicts with subjective well-being at the within-person level among middle school students. These findings suggest that persistent exposure to interparental conflicts was associated with individual differences in subjective well-being, and consistently perceived positive teacher-student relationships buffered the negative association of interparental conflicts with subjective well-being among early adolescents, highlighting the protective effects of quality teacher-student relationships across contexts.

AB Droplets are critical vectors for transmitting respiratory diseases indoors. The dispersion and survival of droplets generated by human respiratory activities are closely related to their evaporation characteristics, which are strongly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity (RH). This study employs an optimized multicomponent evaporation model, incorporating both the Kelvin effect and the solute effect, to investigate droplet evaporation times and equilibrium diameters under varying indoor environmental conditions. The findings demonstrate that the improved model more accurately predicts evaporation time and droplet nuclei sizes in realistic indoor scenarios. High relative humidity and low indoor temperature conditions prolong droplet evaporation, potentially extending viral survival. For example, droplets initially sized at 50 mu m exhibited larger normalized equilibrium diameters at 90 % RH (0.44) compared to 50 % RH (0.366), and smaller droplets had lower final normalized diameters (de/d0). Additionally, increased initial droplet velocity accelerated evaporation. Based on these results, practical recommendations are proposed: Firstly, virus survival conditions are optimal shortly after droplet emission, necessitating immediate preventive measures such as social distancing and proper mask usage. Secondly, maintaining indoor environments at moderately high temperatures and medium humidity levels accelerates droplet evaporation, reducing virus viability, and thus lowering the risk of disease transmission and human exposure.

AB Firms may benefit from knowledge co-creation in the innovation ecosystem, causing the innovation ecosystem to serve as an efficient way to generate breakthrough innovation. However, the in-and-out ways of knowledge co-creation in the ecosystem have not been fully explored collectively. Drawing on knowledge-based view and dynamic capability theory, we categorize two types of knowledge co-creation between the focal firm and ecosystem partners, namely embedded knowledge co-creation and alliance knowledge co-creation. Thereafter, we link knowledge co-creation and breakthrough innovation of the focal firm and further analyze the mediating role of capability reconfiguration. An empirical examination of 382 surveys from Chinese high-tech firms reveals that both two types of knowledge co-creation can promote breakthrough innovation. Besides, substitutional capability significantly mediates the relationships between knowledge co-creation and breakthrough innovation, while evolutionary capability reconfiguration suppresses the above relationships. Our findings extend the context of knowledge co-creation to innovation ecosystems and contributes to innovation and dynamic capability literature. Our study also expounds on valuable practical implications for managers.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of alkynyl sulfides has been developed by copper catalyzing the cross-coupling reaction of alkynyl halides/terminal alkynes with arylthioaluminum reagents. Various alkynyl sulfides can be obtained with 12-96% yields from the cross-coupling between alkynyl halides and arylthioaluminum reagents using 5 mol % Cu2O/10 mol % TFP (tri(2-furanyl)phosphine) as the catalyst at 100 degrees C for 1 h. In the one-pot step-by-step method, various alkynyl sulfides can be obtained with 5-93% yields from the cross-coupling between terminal alkynes and arylthioaluminum reagents using 5 mol % Cu(OAc)2/10 mol % DPPY (2-(diphenylphosphino)pyridine) as the catalyst at 100 degrees C for 3 h. The coupling reaction can be carried out smoothly regardless of the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing group on the aromatic ring of organic thioaluminum reagents or aryl terminal alkynes. In addition, the broad substrate scope and the typical maintenance of vigorous efficiency on the gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize alkynyl sulfides. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

AB This study examines how the severance of political connections in customer firms affects the ESG performance of their upstream suppliers. Using a matched customer-supplier dataset of Chinese listed firms and the "Regulation 18" in 2013 as a quasi-natural experiment, we construct a difference-in-differences framework to identify the causal effect. The results show that the severance of customers' political ties significantly reduces suppliers' ESG scores, particularly in the environmental and social dimensions. Mechanism analyses suggest that this effect is driven by financial pressure transmission and elevated perceived default risk. Our findings highlight the inter-firm spillover of political events through supply chains and suggest that corporate ESG behavior is not only firm-driven but also relationally shaped.

TI Multifaceted reactions of difluorocarbene with amines: synthesis and
   mechanistic insights
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Review
ID N-DIFLUOROMETHYLATION; FLUORINE; IMIDAZOLES
AB Difluorocarbene (:CF2), a highly reactive fluorine-containing intermediate, has emerged as a central research subject in the interdisciplinary domain of modern fluorine chemistry and synthetic methodology, owing to its unique electronic structure and diverse reactivity. The application scope of this intermediate as a versatile "carbon source" is not limited to conventional fluorination reactions but also includes non-traditional transformations. In organic synthesis, difluorocarbene exhibits a remarkable diversity of reactivity with amines. For instance, primary amines undergo nucleophilic attack to form fluoroimine and isocyanide intermediates, which can be further converted into fluorinated heterocyclic compounds, other heterocycles, and nitriles. Secondary amines, in turn, follow nucleophilic substitution pathways to achieve nitrogen-centered difluoromethylation or formylation. Tertiary amines, on the other hand, evolve into ammonium ylides through N-difluoromethylation, subsequently triggering cascade reactions, including cyclization, fluorination, C-N bond cleavage, and coupling processes. Herein, this review systematically summarizes the multifaceted reactivity of difluorocarbene with amines and highlights recent breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.

AB The practical application of manganese-based cathodes in aqueous zinc-ion batteries is hampered by structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, controlled synthesis of MnO2 polymorphs was achieved by modulating hydrothermal preparation methods. Using (NH4)(2)C2O4 and NH4F as precursors, we fabricate oxygen-deficient MnO1.88 nanomaterials (denoted 1(#) and 2(#), respectively) featuring distinctive nanowire morphologies. When tested in Zn||MnO2 cells with 2 M ZnSO4 + 0.2 M MnSO4 aqueous electrolyte at room temperature and comparable electrode loadings (similar to 1.5 mg cm(-1)), the optimized 2(#) cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 358 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and maintained 85 % capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1). Structural and electrochemical analysis reveals that the synergistic combination of oxygen vacancies and possible F-Mn interactions in the 2(#) material synergistically enhances Zn2+ diffusion kinetics and effectively mitigates Jahn-Teller distortion-induced structural degradation. This work establishes a precursor-guided strategy for engineering MnO2 cathodes with simultaneously improved rate capability and cycling stability for aqueous zinc-ion batteries.

AB The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) increases the vulnerability of power systems to cyber-physical threats, particularly denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that exploit transient instabilities caused by renewable generation fluctuations. These attacks disrupt communication channels, leading to cascading frequency deviations and increased risk of systems instability. To address this challenge, we propose a multilayer defense framework integrating attack modeling, adaptive control, and stability guarantees. First, a frequency-driven DoS attack model is constructed by analyzing frequency trends to identify vulnerable regulation periods and support proactive threat prediction. Second, a hybrid information-based reinforcement learning (HIRL) strategy is developed to adaptively optimize transmission intervals under DoS attacks, balancing regulation performance and communication efficiency. Third, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy load frequency control with virtual synchronous generator (VSG-LFC) scheme is designed to enhance frequency stability through inertia emulation, mitigating both renewable intermittency and attack-induced oscillations. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to establish theoretical guarantees for the coupled cyber-physical systems. Finally, simulation results on the New England nine-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed framework, showing superior frequency stability compared to conventional methods.

AB This paper presents a novel load frequency control (LFC) strategy for energy storage system (ESS)-integrated power systems, leveraging interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy logic and an adaptive integrated event-triggered scheme (AIETS). The proposed IT-2 fuzzy LFC addresses the nonlinearities in governor and turbine dynamics, ensuring robust system performance. To enhance bandwidth efficiency, AIETS introduces a time-varying threshold and historical state feedback. Additionally, a fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) control are designed to stabilize the system. Moreover, a machine learning-driven optimization algorithm is designed, further improving the system's dynamic response. Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) with less restrictive conditions are constructed to derive relaxed stability criteria. Simulations validate the proposed method's superior performance and demonstrate its practical advantages.

AB The clinical application of Chuanminshen violaceum polysaccharides (CVP), a natural immunomodulator with intrinsic antioxidant activity, is constrained by rapid systemic clearance, limited tissue specificity, and short-lived bioactivity. To address these limitations, a multifunctional biomimetic nanoplatform incorporating erythrocyte membrane camouflage, mannose-mediated active targeting, and squalene-stabilized Pickering emulsion technology was developed. CVP-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (CVPP) were fabricated via solvent evaporation, coated with erythrocyte membranes, and subsequently functionalized with mannose to obtain CVPP@M-M. This dual modification enabled selective recognition by macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) mannose receptors, while the erythrocyte membrane imparted prolonged systemic circulation. Subsequent emulsification for the first time with squalene yielded CVPP@M-M-PPAS, a Pickering emulsion designed for enhanced lymph node delivery. In vitro, CVPP@M-M-PPAS significantly promoted macrophage activation, as evidenced by elevated CD80(+)/CD86(+) expression, compared with free CVP. In vivo, intramuscular co-administration with ovalbumin (OVA) antigen induced pronounced DC maturation and T cell polarization in the spleen. This formulation also elicited robust and sustained production of antigen-specific IgG, accompanied by increased upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In vivo imaging demonstrated prolonged lymph node retention (> 336 h) with a near-linear fluorescence decay profile, confirming controlled release kinetics. By integrating stealth properties, receptor-specific targeting, and emulsion-enabled lymphatic trafficking, this nanoplatform effectively circumvents the pharmacokinetic and biodistributional barriers of plant-derived polysaccharides, enabling durable humoral and cellular immune responses. This strategy offers a generalizable framework for translating natural immunomodulators into clinically viable nanotherapeutics.

SO APL MATERIALS

AB Thermal cyclic annealing (TCA) is recognized as the key process in improving Ge film quality during epitaxial growth on Si substrates. In Ge-on-Si systems, annealing temperatures rarely exceed 900 degrees C due to the limitation of the Ge melting point (938 degrees C). In this study, ultra-high temperature TCA is performed on a series of 500 nm Ge buffer layers grown on Si (001), with the upper limit ranging from 900 to 950 degrees C. The structural properties of the Ge thin films are investigated, indicating that an optimized TCA profile occurs with the upper annealing temperature just below the melting point of Ge. Higher annealing temperature above the melting temperature of Ge results in homogeneous alloying of Ge and Si, induced by enhanced Si diffusion into Ge. This process produces a Ge0.75Si0.25 layer with a threading dislocation density of 3.5 x 10(8) cm(-2) and a surface roughness of 3 nm. These findings inspire a novel approach for creating Ge-rich GeSi layers on Si, which potentially benefits the Ge/GeSi/Si (001) heterostructures and their applications in advanced Si-based semiconductor devices.

AB Positive encouragement plays a significant role in parent-child interactions and preschool education, yet its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to explore how positive encouragement affects preschool children's psychological and neurophysiological responses during a block-stacking task. A total of 45 children (average age 5 years) were assigned to either an encouragement group or a non-encouragement group. The facial expressions, heart rate variability, and brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were spontaneously measured. The results revealed significant differences in oxyhemoglobin levels in the Middle Temporal Gyrus (channel 2), the Frontal Eye Fields (channel 21), and the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (channel 5). The encouragement group exhibited significantly higher proportions of happiness, lower negative emotions, and stronger functional connectivity between specific brain regions compared to the non-encouraged group. Additionally, heart rate variability was more stable, and the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals was significantly lower in the encouraged group. These findings suggest that the positive encouragement may enhance the ability to regulate emotions, improve cognitive performance, and help maintain emotional stability, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying emotional and cognitive responses to positive social interactions in preschool children.

While most studies on cognitive bias focused on its negative effects, this study aims to investigate the positive influence of cognitive bias on business model innovation (BMI) through the mediating effect of effectuation, which was not found in previous literature.Design/methodology/approachThe study use two-wave survey data from 206 startups in China, and structural equation modeling, bootstrap and hierarchical regression methods to test the hypotheses.FindingsThe results reveal that overconfidence (OC) and illusion of control (IC) positively affect BMI, and effectuation (EF) mediates the relationship between OC/IC and BMI. In addition, environmental hostility is found to moderate the effects of OC/IC/EF on BMI.Originality/valueThis study conclusion challenges previous assumptions about cognitive bias and extends the research on antecedents of BMI from the perspective of cognition, and provides an important reference for startups to manage cognitive bias and make decision.

AB Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is widely used to inhibit virus replication and transmission. However, it lacks targeting capabilities and sustained-release properties. In contrast, carbon quantum dots can not only inhibit virus replication directly but can also serve as drug carriers to enhance the targeting capacity and efficacy of antiviral drugs. In this study, CGA carbon dots (CGA-CDs) were prepared using a microwave-assisted synthesis method. The physicochemical characteristics and antiviral activities of CGA-CDs against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) were explored through a series of experiments. The average particle size of CGA-CDs was 5.675 +/- 0.15 nm. The CGA-CDs were non-ordered carbon structures composed of C and O, with uniform size, good dispersion properties, and a surface rich in-COOH, -OH, and other hydrophilic groups. The optimal excitation wavelength of CGA-CDs was 390 nm, the emission wavelength was 450 nm, and the CGA-CDs thus emitted blue fluorescence. Notably, CGA-CDs produced significantly stronger antiviral effects than equivalent concentrations of CGA and could successfully inhibit virus adsorption and replication. Furthermore, CGA-CDs significantly inhibited virus-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial autophagy, and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) degradation, providing superior antiviral efficacy. In vivo experiments further demonstrated the good biocompatibility of CGA-CDs. Moreover, in NDV-infected chickens, CGA-CDs significantly reduced the viral load in the spleen and proventriculus, alleviated pathological damage to major organs, enhanced antibody responses, and markedly lowered the mortality rate. In summary, CGA-CDs showed significant anti-NDV activity by inhibiting NDV adsorption and replication, likely through the inhibition of virus-induced mitophagy and MAVS degradation. These findings highlight the potential of CGA-CDs as potent antiviral agents.

AB Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the largest flux of carbon from land to the atmosphere and is strongly influenced by soil moisture. Nevertheless, the response of ER to soil moisture remains poorly understood. Here, the ER-soil moisture response curves at 135 sites from the global FLUXNET are analyzed. In contrast to the typically assumed monotonic increase in respiratory carbon emissions with increasing soil moisture derived from land surface models, the study shows that 106 sites exhibit a unimodal soil moisture response with a peak in ER at an apparent optimum soil moisture (SMER opt), implying a prevalent inhibitory effect of soil moisture excess on ER. Among the 12 biotic and abiotic variables examined, the SMER opt is mostly related to local water availability, with drier sites showing lower SMER opt than wetter sites, possibly reflecting water adaptation of ER. This adaptation is further supported by a field experiment that exclusively manipulates water and holds other factors constant, showing a downward shift in SMER opt after long-term water deficit. These results reveal the large variation of SMER opt and the water adaptation of ER, providing novel insights for understanding and forecasting carbon-climate feedbacks.

AB Selaginellin A (Sela A), a derivative from Selaginella tamariscina, exerts antitriple-negative breast cancer effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteomic profiling identified 1136 differentially expressed proteins after Sela A treatment, predominantly downregulated (n = 889). Enrichment analyses revealed that Sela A significantly downregulated pathways critical for DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression, while upregulating ribosomal biogenesis and protein processing. Mechanistically, Sela A acts as a PTP1B inhibitor (IC50 = 7.4 mu m), binding key residues (PHE-182, GLU-186). This inhibition activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTOR). Consequently, mTOR activation stimulates ribosomal synthesis but concurrently triggers a p70S6K-mediated negative feedback loop, degrading IRS1. IRS1 loss suppresses Akt signaling, reducing expression of cell cycle proteins and inducing G1-phase arrest. Thus, Sela A may block MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation via PTP1B inhibition driving mTOR/IRS1/Akt dysregulation.

   Nanosphere Probes
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The identification and detection of specific autophagy signaling pathways in live cancer cells are critical to modulate chemotherapy sensitivity in cancer treatments. However, conventional autophagy signaling pathway detection approaches are challenged by specificity and sensitivity. Here, with the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticle (NP)-DNA nanospheres (ZnO-DNA NSs) using palindromic DNA sequence scaffolds, we propose a new strategy for sensitive detection of a specific autophagy signaling pathway in cancer cells via simultaneously imaging the upstream miRNA-34a and downstream autophagy-related 4B cysteine peptidase (ATG4B). The miRNA-34a-responsive, Zn2+-dependent I-R3 DNAzyme (I-Dz) and ATG4B-specific peptide-DNA signal probes are integrated into the ZnO-DNA NSs. Upon readily being delivered into cancer cells, the acid microenvironment leads to the dissolution of ZnO NPs to release the Zn2+ cofactor for I-Dz. Subsequently, miRNA-34a and ATG4B initiated cyclic cleavage of the signal probes to yield distinct fluorescence for highly sensitive detection of miRNA-34a and ATG4B, thereby achieving specific autophagy pathway detection. Besides, the dynamic concentration interplay between miRNA-34a and ATG4B upon drug stimulation can also be monitored by the ZnO-DNA NSs to realize effective discrimination of drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells to access chemoresistance reversion, revealing the robust potential of ZnO-DNA NSs for detecting different autophagy pathways and screening potent therapeutic drugs.

AB Fostering and steering New-Quality Productivity (NQP) to underwrite the sustainable development of the Economic-Social-Environmental System (ESES) in ethnic-minority regions is both an intrinsic requirement and a strategic fulcrum for advancing modernization at the sub-national level. Despite growing policy attention, county-level evidence on how NQP translates into sustainability outcomes-and through which mechanisms-remains insufficient. Embedding NQP within a region-specific sustainability framework, this study first articulates the theoretical channels through which NQP can transform and sustain ethnic areas. It then exploits panel data covering 67 ethnic counties in Sichuan Province from 2005 to 2024 and applies benchmark regressions, multiple-mediator models, and spatial Durbin specifications to identify the mechanisms and impact footprints of NQP. Three core findings emerge: (1) NQP exerts a robust, positive effect on ESE sustainability that varies across geography, development stages, and sectoral structures. (2) Technological innovation, industrial upgrading, and optimized resource allocation all transmit NQP's influence, with industrial upgrading displaying the strongest mediating power. (3) NQP generates positive spatial spillovers that extend its sustainability dividends to neighboring ethnic counties. These results sharpen the academic understanding of the NQP-sustainability nexus in ethnic contexts, expand NQP assessment frameworks, and furnish county-level policymakers with evidence to design differentiated strategies that align NQP cultivation with broader goals of regionally inclusive and sustainable development.

AB Yak milk, a nutritionally dense dairy product indigenous to high-altitude ecosystems, exhibits unique compositional features distinct from those of bovine milk. The developmental trajectory and functional diversification of its whey proteome across key lactation phases (colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk) remain poorly understood. This study implemented high-resolution Astral data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics to systematically map stage-specific whey proteome dynamics. Quantitative analysis identified 1344, 1334, and 1309 unique whey proteins in colostral, transitional, and mature phases, respectively. Multidimensional functional annotation (GO, KEGG, and EggNOG) revealed stage-specific divergence: colostrum proteins were predominantly associated with immune system processes, while transitional and mature milk proteins shifted toward cell transportation, secretion, and vesicle transportation. Temporal expression patterns were deciphered through mFuzz clustering, identifying nine representative whey proteins. This comprehensive investigation elucidates lactation-stage-specific proteomic signatures and their biological implications, advancing insights into yak milk's bioactive properties.

AB The animal husbandry industry is a major source of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, and methods to reduce methane production from livestock during rumen fermentation are an important research issue. Distillery spent wash (DSW) is a by-product of the brewing industry, and to our knowledge, its application in feed processing has rarely been reported. This work investigated the effect of using DSW as an additive on silage fermentation and in vitro methane production. A small-scale silage production system for whole-plant maize was applied, and maize was treated without (control) and with DSW (G2, 10 mL<middle dot>kg(-1) fresh matter (FM); G4, 20 mL<middle dot>kg(-1) fresh matter). After 60 days of ensiling, the pH value of G2- and G4-treated whole-plant maize was reduced (p < 0.05), while lactic acid production was significantly enhanced to 3.40% DM for G2 and to 3.43% DM for G4, effectively improving silage fermentation. In fact, the addition of DSW shifted the bacterial community structure in whole-plant maize silage, significantly increasing the dominance of Lactiplantibacillus from 10.1% (CK) to 74.1% (G2) and 62.5% (G4) and thereby decreasing the diversity indices of silage samples. However, DSW application increased the ammonia-N levels in silage by 135.29-147.06% compared with the control. Importantly, there was a reduction of 0.70 and 0.55 percentage units in CK for G2 and G4, respectively, which represent 57.6% and 44.0% reductions in the acetic acid concentration, respectively, which were accompanied by a trend of decreasing methane production and Methanobrevibacter abundance. In conclusion, DSW exhibits potential for enhancing lactic acid fermentation by increasing Lactiplantibacillus and for inhibiting in vitro rumen methane production by promoting Methanobrevibacter dominance.

AB This study aimed to elucidate how rosmarinic acid (0, 0.01, 0.03 g/100 mL) affects the microbial activity, antioxidant capacity, and metabolite profiles of fermented milk co-cultured with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and commercial starter. Rosmarinic acid supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) boosted bacterial survival. Furthermore, incorporation of rosmarinic acid accelerated acid-producing capacity of starter cultures, and improved antioxidant capacity of fermented milk, particularly at a concentration of 0.03 g/100 mL. Metabolomics analysis revealed that rosmarinic acid induced distinct metabolic alterations, leading to the identification of 80 differential metabolites in samples treated with 0.03 g/100 mL rosmarinic acid compared to the untreated samples. Notably, rosmarinic acid-fortified samples exhibited higher levels of peptides and polyphenol metabolites but lower levels of oligosaccharide and lipid metabolites compared to the non-fortified samples (P < 0.05). Overall, rosmarinic acid can be incorporated as an active ingredient in milk fermentation to develop a novel functional food with substantial health benefits.

AB Against the backdrop of deepening implementation of the "Dual Carbon" strategy and increasing awareness of green consumption, corporate "greenwashing" behaviors have attracted growing social attention. Using Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2023 as the sample, this paper systematically analyzes whether the level of green consumption can effectively restrain corporate greenwashing behaviors. It also introduces green credit as a moderating variable to explore its role within the green governance mechanism. The empirical results show that the level of green consumption significantly suppresses corporate greenwashing, and this conclusion remains robust after a series of consistency checks. In addition, green credit strengthens the inhibitory effect of green consumption on corporate greenwashing behaviors. Further heterogeneity analysis reveals that the restraining effect of green consumption on greenwashing is more pronounced in the central and western regions and among state-owned enterprises. This study not only enriches the theoretical connotation of external constraints in green governance, but also provides micro-level empirical support for improving green financial policies and consumption guidance.

AB The ability to generate dynamic, expressive dance routines that adapt to various musical compositions has broad applications in activity recognition, performance arts, entertainment, virtual reality, and interactive media, offering new avenues for creative professionals and audiences alike. In this article a deep learning framework is developed for music-synchronized dance choreography through modified vision transformers and graph convolutional networks based on Mexican hat wavelet function for position quantization and motion forecasting. More explicitly high-dimensional pose characteristics are extracted from dance video frames using modified vision transformer to generate a skeletal graph, while modified graph convolutional network captures the spatial and temporal relationships between human joints. The process of discretizing continuous pose data is performed by using K-mean clustering and vector quantized variational autoencoders, respectively. The music synchronization beat-aligned loss was optimized, and the best-tuned weight coefficients were found using two variants of the differential evolution algorithm, based on controlled mutation factors \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:\mathcal{F}$$\end{document} =log-sigmoid () and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\:\mathcal{F}$$\end{document} =rand().

AB To elucidate the driving mechanisms behind postharvest spatial moisture diffusion variations in Phyllostachys edulis, cell wall structure across different regions of bamboo shoots was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe microstructure, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for determining cellulose crystallinity index, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for identifying functional groups (hydroxyl, carboxyl) of cellulose and hemicellulose, and Congo Red assay for assessing hydroxyl group accessibility of hemicellulose. Combined with osmotic substances (sugars, proteins), oxidative stress markers, and moisture distribution (via low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)), this study clarified synergistic regulation of moisture by cell wall architecture, osmotic pressure, and oxidative stress. Results indicated that the spatial moisture distribution in bamboo is jointly governed by cell wall differentiation and osmotic pressure gradients-from the shoot apex to the base, the base showed increased lignification (hardness rising from 49.61 N to 90.68 N), enhanced cellulose crystallinity (from 46.23 % to 52.05 %), and increased intensity of characteristic peaks of hemicellulose and cellulose hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, alongside altered monosaccharide composition. The dense physical barrier at the bamboo shoot base, combined with a highly soluble matrix, sustains higher osmotic pressure, delaying water loss. In contrast, the shoot apex dehydrates rapidly (moisture content from 91.78 % to 87.98 %), activating peroxidase and increasing malondialdehyde, leading to membrane damage and accelerated dehydration. This study reveals that structural features and osmotic pressure regulate spatial water distribution, while oxidative stress at the apex exacerbates structural damage, providing a theoretical basis for moisture retention strategies in perishable horticultural products.

AB Hydrogen embrittlement critically compromises the performance of structural materials in fusion reactors. Through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated the vacancy and chromium effects on hydrogen behavior in pure Fe and Fe9Cr alloys. The roles of Cr and vacancies on geometric structures, dissolution energy, trapping energy, stability, and electronic structures were emphasized. In both systems, energetic analysis revealed that H atoms preferentially occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites in defect-free lattices, but shift to nearoctahedral sites near vacancies in vacancy-containing lattices. Fe9Cr has a hydrogen dissolution energy 0.1-0.35 eV higher than that of pure Fe. Although Cr enhances the system overall stability, it concurrently induces local lattice strain, reducing vacancy formation energy. The additional single vacancies serve as effective trapping sites for H atoms, which substantially impedes hydrogen diffusion. These findings elucidated the mechanistic role of Cr in mitigating hydrogen embrittlement, providing fundamental insights for developing radiation-resistant structural materials in fusion applications.

AB The Tibetan pig, as a typical highland breed, has a higher newborn-to-sow weight ratio than low-altitude breeds, which may be associated with better offspring survival in high-altitude environments. This suggests Tibetan pigs need a healthier physiological state during gestation. Understanding physiological changes during pregnancy is thus crucial for improving their reproductive performance. The ovaries secrete pregnancy-related hormones, while the spleen regulates immunity as a key immune organ. Both are vital for maintaining maternal health, yet their physiological changes during pregnancy in Tibetan pigs remain unclear. This study compared the transcriptome changes of the ovaries and spleens in non-pregnant and pregnant Tibetan pigs. The ovaries showed more pronounced transcriptional changes, with 757 differentially expressed PCGs (466 upregulated, e.g., ISM1, PRKAA2, STAR, CEBPB; 291 downregulated, e.g., BMP15, MOS) and 53 differentially expressed lncRNAs (34 upregulated, 19 downregulated). In the spleen, 229 PCGs were differentially expressed (76 upregulated, e.g., ISM1, PRKAA2, ESR1, CXCL8; 153 downregulated, e.g., NFATC4), along with 14 differentially expressed lncRNAs (5 upregulated, 9 downregulated). Functional analysis revealed enhanced ovarian hormone synthesis and suppressed oocyte activity, alongside reduced splenic inflammation during pregnancy. Notably, both organs showed increased lipid metabolism, and inflammation-related pathways were activated in the ovaries. Key candidate genes and regulatory factors potentially involved in pregnancy-related changes were also predicted. Overall, this study highlights transcriptional shifts in Tibetan pig ovaries and spleens during pregnancy, offering insights into plateau animal reproduction and strategies to improve Tibetan pig fertility.

AB With the progress of rural revitalization, understanding the influence of fire pit heating on the indoor thermal environment has become increasingly important. This study investigates the dynamic effects of fire pit heating through field surveys and parameter decomposition. Three primary fire pit factors-material, inlet air velocity, and wall thickness-were coupled with architectural parameters such as envelope materials and window-to-wall ratios, as well as outdoor conditions including temperature and wind speed. The dynamic residual heating process during winter nights was analyzed. Results show that, at the fire pit level, the significance of parameters on indoor thermal comfort follows the order: material > thickness > inlet air velocity. At the building level, the window-to-wall ratio exerts the greatest influence, whereas local envelope materials show relatively minor effects. Furthermore, the fundamental design parameters of the fire pit were defined as follows: an inlet air velocity of 0.2 m/s, a pit thickness of 0.285 m, and ordinary brick as the construction material. Based on these parameters, the system ensures reasonable indoor air circulation and complete combustion of the fire pit without causing safety hazards. During an 8-hour nighttime cooling process, the average bedroom temperature remained 16.87 C-degrees higher than the outdoor mean, demonstrating effective heating performance. This study proposes a coupled multi-factor dynamic heating model of the fire pit to evaluate its impact on indoor thermal comfort, providing design strategies and a theoretical basis for optimizing traditional fire pit systems and improving winter thermal comfort in traditional dwellings.

AB This study investigates the developmental trajectories of aversion to both disadvantageous and advantageous inequity in a large sample of Chinese students (N = 3190) across four educational stages: primary school, junior high school, senior high school and college. Results revealed that participants' disadvantageous inequity aversion showed a continuously decreasing linear trend with grade. In contrast, aversion to advantageous inequity followed a complex, overall inverted U-shaped, stage-dependent pattern. Findings suggest that the development of inequity aversion is not a single, continuous process, but rather a dynamic pattern shaped by the type of inequity, cultural background, and specific educational stage. This study offers a new perspective on understanding of fairness, highlighting their relevance in students' moral decision-making whthin increasingly digitalized social environments.

AB Colonization of gut microbes in young ruminants plays a fundamental role in their lifelong health. Although the relationship between breast milk (BM) and the gut microbiota of young animals has been reported, its specific impact on goats has yet to be thoroughly explored. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively reveal the influence of breast milk feeding on the development of intestinal microorganisms in goat kids and the interactions between breast milk microbiome and fecal microbiome. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the richness of breast milk microbiota between the BMD1, BMD7, and BMD14 groups (P < 0.05). At the genus level, the bacterial microbiota in breast milk across different days of age was predominantly composed of Pseudomonas, Asticcacaulis, Mannheimia, Sphingomonas, and Staphylococcus. In contrast, the fecal microbiota of goat kids was primarily dominated by Escherichia-Shigella, Butyricicoccus, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Limosilactobacillus. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were observed between the microbial communities of breast milk and the fecal microbiota of goat kids. Specifically, Delftia in breast milk was positively correlated with Limosilactobacillus and Lactobacillus and negatively correlated with Lachnoclostridium in the rectal feces of goat kids, and Lactobacillus in breast milk was positively correlated with Ruminococcus_gnavus_group. These results suggest that the structure of the breast milk microbiota may influence the colonization of the intestinal microbiota in goat kids, especially for some probiotic genera such as Lactobacillus. In conclusion, this study elucidates the dynamic changes in breast milk microbiota and the shifts in goat kid fecal microbiota following breast milk feeding, as well as the correlations between them. These findings provide a scientific foundation for enhancing goat kid growth, development, and health through early microbiota modulation in practical production.

AB Oleogels are innovative fat replacers with food industry potential, which are formation through the oleogelator as a component. The main aim of this study was to modify egg white-rapeseed dual-protein microgels with Ca2+ (0-0.2 mol/L) to develop a novel oleogelator. The physicochemical properties including microstructure, particle size, and the contact angle of dual-protein microgel were analyzed. The incorporation of Ca2+ improved protein crosslinking through "calcium bridge", confirmed by molecular docking and FT-IR. The addition of Ca2+ could induce the protein structure unfolding and the hydrophobic groups exposure. The air-oil-particle contact angle of microgel decreased to 23.65 degrees, and exhibited the particle size of 116.75 mu m with 0.12 mol/L Ca2+. The pore structure, density and stronger lipophilicity of 0.12 mol/L Ca2+ dual-protein microgels, could make it easier for more oil droplets to be adsorbed in the oleogel. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relation between contact angle and oil absorption capacity of microgels (r = -0.920, p < 0.01). The oil absorption capacity of the dual-protein microgel with 0.12 mol/L Ca2+ increased by 50 % compared with the pure dual-protein sample. The microgel utilized as oleogelator, the rheological properties and thermal stability of oleogels were characterized. The oleogels exhibited characteristic semi-solid behavior (G' > G"), and the addition of Ca2+ increased the heat stability of oleogel. Consequently, these findings provided new insights into the oleogelator produced by protein-based microgel and application in the oleogel creation.

AB Under phosphate (Pi) limiting conditions, lipid remodeling serves as a critical mechanism for enhancing phosphorus (P) use efficiency in plants. This process also affects the photosynthetic process simultaneously, thereby influencing the accumulation of biomass. Our previous studies have proved that Zygophyllum xanthoxylum had a remarkable P remobilization capacity, and could maintain a high biomass under Pi deficiency environment. However, the specific patterns of membrane lipid remodeling and their regulatory effects on photosynthetic performance remain to be elucidated. In this study, the changes of photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, leaves lipid compositions, Pi content and ATPase activity of chloroplast were determined after 1D, 10D and 40D of Pi sufficient and Pi deficient treatments. We found that Pi deficiency did not cause a significant decrease in photosynthetic indices (except 40D treatment) and did not weaken the photosynthetic electron transport process. Under Pi deficiency treatment, the glyceroglycolipid content in leaves showed significant increase at 10D and 40D treatments, but the phospholipid content remained stable. The concentration of Pi and the activity of ATPase in chloroplasts at 1D and 10D treatments were significantly increased, but there was no significant difference between 40D treatment and that of the CP. The results showed that under Pi deficiency environment, Z. xanthoxylum provided structural and functional protection for electron transport process by maintaining the content stability of phospholipids and increasing the glyceroglycolipid content. In addition, more Pi was allocated to chloroplasts, enhancing ATPase activity and providing continuous and stable assimilatory power for the photosynthetic process.

AB Background: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe inflammatory condition marked by an inflammatory response, diffuse alveolar damage, and pulmonary edema. ShaGan QingFei JieDu granules (SGQF) is an established Tibetan medicine formula, commonly used to treat various lung diseases associated with lung heat. However, the role of SGQF in protecting against ALI and its mechanism remains unclear. Purpose: The study objective was to verify the therapeutic effectiveness of SGQF in treating ALI and further investigate its mechanism. Methods: In vivo, animal models of ALI were established by inducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects and molecular mechanisms of SGQF in ALI. HPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS was employed to identify the SGQF components, and a 293 T-TGF-(31 cell model was established to screen the bioactivity of major components. The MLE-12 cell injury model was then used to validate the mechanisms through which the key active components exert their effects. Results: SGQF reduced the pathological signs in the lung tissue of ALI by reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-(31, Smad2/3, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was also significantly downregulated, while Smad7 was significantly upregulated. A total of 83 compounds, consisting of phenolic acids, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, alkaloids, coumarins, terpenoids, and other categories, were successfully characterized. In a 293 T-TGF-(31 cell model and molecular docking, isoliquiritin (ILQ) significantly inhibited TGF-(31 activity. In an MLE-12 cell injury model, ILQ notably reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exerted a protective effect on alveolar epithelial cells by downregulating the expression of Smad2/3 and upregulating the expression of Smad7. Conclusion: These findings suggest that SGQF mitigates LPS-induced ALI in mice by inhibiting the TGF-(3/Smad signaling pathway, with ILQ being a key active component responsible for this regulatory effect.

AB Islanded microgrid brings advantages with more flexibility, decarbonization, affordability, and social equity. In potential real-world applications, some issues are raised up: 1) unexpected loads from end-user demand and line impedance mismatches in physical system and 2) topology variations and invading information in control signal under unforeseen network environments. This article proposes a distributed sliding-mode-based resilient secondary restoration control to deal with load changes and cyber-attacks. Through virtual impedance method, an accurate power sharing control strategy is developed to tackle line impedance mismatches. Then, a unified microgrid secondary control system model under denial-of-service and false data injection attacks is established. Sufficient conditions related to with hybrid dynamic characteristics are conducted for robust analyses. Evaluation tests show that this development has practical significance on power distribution with voltage and frequency stability in microgrid.

ID ORGANIC FRAMEWORK NANOPARTICLES; TARGETED DELIVERY; DEFENSE; ACID
AB Current agricultural practices involving foliar fertilization are hampered by significant challenges, including poor nutrient retention on leaf surfaces and consequently low utilization efficiency. To address this, we developed a novel nanoparticle-based foliar delivery system, consisting of P and K-loaded UiO-66 metal-organic framework nanoparticles (PK/UiO-66 NPs). This system was engineered to exhibit superior foliar adhesion and controlled nutrient release. The unique structure and chemical properties of PK/UiO-66 NPs conferred exceptional performance, ensuring a prolonged and steady nutrient supply to plants even after exposure to simulated rainfall. Compared to control groups, pea seedlings treated with PK/UiO-66 NPs demonstrated remarkable growth enhancement, with stem length increasing by up to 24.4% and pod fresh weight surging by 106.6%. The nano-formulation exhibited excellent resistance to rain washout and controlled-release characteristics. PK/UiO-66 NPs released only 62.3% of their P content after 48 hours, in stark contrast to conventional KH2PO4 solution, which released over 90% within 2 hours. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis provided molecular insights into the mechanism of action, revealing that PK/UiO-66 NPs significantly upregulated genes associated with photosynthesis, plant hormone signalling, and overall plant development. This study not only presents a highly effective approach to improve foliar fertilization efficiency, but also establishes a promising platform for the design of advanced, sustainable nano-fertilisers for modern agriculture.

ID PH
AB Bacteria-infected wound often emerges with accumulation of dense exudates and toxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN) released by bacteria, creating a vicious cycle of nutrient enrichment, bacterial proliferation, and toxin-induced inflammation that aggravates infection. While most current strategies focus primarily on antibacterial activity, they often neglect the critical roles of exudate clearance and inflammation control. Here, a wood-based biopatch (pro-bioP) is designed to accelerate bacteria-infected wound healing through a photothermal-triggered programmed therapeutic strategy. This approach integrates photothermal bacteria-killing, photothermal enhanced exudate drainage, and capture of LPS or PGN to mitigate excessive inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that pro-bioP exhibits potent antibacterial efficacy, efficient removal of viscous exudates, and strong anti-inflammatory activity, thereby promoting rapid tissue repair. As mentioned above, the pro-bioP provides a strategy for wound therapy with bacterial infection and accompanying inflammation.

AB Wormlike micelles, which are flexible elongated aggregates formed by the self-assembly of surfactant molecules in aqueous solutions, have been widely applied in various fields because of their unique morphology and dynamic characteristics. However, the studies on the unsaturation of tails, particularly in solutions of double-tailed surfactants, remain limited. This study examines the influence of the chemical structure of hydrophobic tails on the formation and rheological properties of wormlike micelles. Two types of double-tailed surfactants with distinct tail structures, one containing double bonds and the other without, were designed and synthesized. The results show that introducing double bonds into the tail significantly affects the formation mechanism and physicochemical properties of wormlike micelles. Wormlike micelles formed from surfactants with double bonds exhibit enhanced rheological properties and viscoelastic behavior. This study enhances the understanding of the relationship between surfactant tail structure and micelle behavior. It provides theoretical and experimental support for the future design of efficient surfactants and offers new perspectives and technical guidance for their application in enhanced oil recovery, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Future studies could explore the behavior of structurally diverse double-tailed surfactants in more complex solutions, thus expanding their potential applications across broader fields.

AB To address the challenges of information perception, this paper proposes a novel adaptive filtering algorithm. The algorithm is built upon an asymmetric cost function. It incorporates an information perception strategy, referred to as the information perception adaptive filtering (IPAF) algorithm, in which the parameters of the cost function are directly linked to statistical characteristics. The key advantage of this algorithm is that its parameters can be adaptively adjusted in real-time according to higher-order statistical properties in different environments, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed-parameter algorithms. A comprehensive performance analysis of the IPAF algorithm is presented, including convergence analysis, mean square deviation analysis, and computational complexity analysis. Extensive simulation experiments and evaluations of real datasets demonstrate that the IPAF algorithm achieves reliable information perception with excellent robustness.

AB Cryptotanshinone (CPT), the main active compound of Salvia miltiorrhiza, is known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antifibrotic effects. In this study, the hepatoprotective effect and mechanisms of CPT were explored using transcriptome and network pharmacology. A carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury (ALI) mouse model was established. The anti-ALI effects of different doses of CPT were evaluated by analysis of biochemical indicators, histopathological staining, and immunohistochemical analysis. Combining network pharmacology with transcriptomic analysis revealed therapeutic targets, which were subsequently validated through polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. CPT (40 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 beta in model mice and regulated oxidative stress indicators, including malonaldehyde, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase. MCP-1 protein expression in the liver was inhibited by treatment with CPT. Network pharmacology revealed 72 core targets involved in the treatment of ALI by CPT. By combining transcriptomic data from liver tissue, three key targets-TNF-alpha, TLR9, and ADORA2B-were identified, along with the TLR, IL-17, and TNF signaling pathways. Furthermore, PCR and Western blot assays revealed that CPT significantly decreased TNF-alpha, TLR9, and ADORA2B expression levels in the livers of ALI mice. In conclusion, the hepatoprotective effects of CPT may be related to the suppression of TNF-alpha-, TLR9-, and ADORA2B-mediated inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These results provide a foundation for the development of CPT as a potential therapeutic agent for ALI.

AB Traditional methods for identifying medicinal plant species, such as spectroscopy and chromatography, are often labor-intensive, require specific experimental conditions, and may disturb the natural ecological environment. To address these limitations, this study proposed a non-destructive, UAV-based deep learning approach for largescale resource assessment of four Gentianaceae species. The YOLO series models, known for their high detection speed and accuracy, were applied for species identification. We evaluated the impact of input image resolution, network architecture, and data augmentation strategies on model performance. The results showed that using 640 x 640 pixel images significantly improved detection accuracy compared to 160 x 160 pixels. The YOLOv5s model achieved the best performance, with a precision of 0.844, recall of 0.801, and mean average precision (mAP0.5) of 0.889 at a resolution of 640 x 640. In contrast, when the input was 160 x 160, the model's performance declined (precision = 0.76, recall = 0.60, mAP = 0.684), though training time decreased to 0.442 h. Among the improved architectures, YOLOv5s-ShuffleV2 achieved relatively high accuracy (precision = 0.785, mAP0.5 = 0.764) with fewer parameters (3.19 million), offering a lightweight solution for real-time applications. The YOLOv5s model remained the fastest and most accurate model overall (mAP = 0.889, training time = 0.629 h). Data augmentation further improved model generalization across environmental conditions. Applying the optimized model for resource assessment in 40 regions, we achieved an overall mAP0.5 of 0.798 and accuracy of 0.901, with an R2 of 0.98. Among the four target species: Gentiana straminea Maxim. (GsM), Gentiana crassicaulis Duthie ex Burkill. (GcDB), Gentiana siphonantha Maxim. ex Kusn. (GsMK), and Gentiana officinalis Harry Sm (GoHM), GsM achieved highest detection accuracy (mAP0.5 = 0.866), while GoHM was the most challenging (mAP0.5 = 0.742, recall = 0.557). This approach demonstrates the potential for large-scale, non-destructive surveys of wild Gentianaceae resources and offers significant value for similar medicinal plant resource assessments.

TI Mamba with multi-frequency perception for image super-resolution

ID NETWORK
AB Image super-resolution (SR) focuses on reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input, aiming to restore fine details and improve perceptual quality. Recently, Mamba has shown promise for SR, owing to its efficient sequential modeling capability. However, existing Mamba-based approaches often neglect the joint impact of remote-distance information decay and insufficient local information dependencies. To address this issue, we propose MFPMamba, a novel image SR method designed to enhance both the global and local feature representation capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, a multi-frequency decoupling perception module (MFDP) is introduced to augment Mamba with frequency-domain information. In this module, features are decomposed into lowand high-frequency components via the wavelet transform, and specialized decoupled convolutions are employed to effectively process each component. In addition, a multi-domain adaptive fusion module (MDAF) is developed to facilitate the integration of spatial-domain features encoded by Mamba and frequency-domain features encoded by MFDP. The channel weights are adaptively determined through the uniform quantification of features across different domains. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved. In the x4 task, our method improves the PSNR by 0.16 and 0.25 dB on the Urban100 and Manga109 datasets, respectively, over the baseline, and reduces the memory consumption by 12%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-frequency perception in assisting Mamba to achieve image SR.

AB Exploring the regulatory role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in plateau yak is crucial to understanding its metabolic network for adapting to extreme environments. By integrating transcriptomic sequencing and co-expression network analysis, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and lncRNA expression characteristics of yak liver at three growth and development stages were systematically analyzed. A total of 35,216 mRNAs and 10,073 lncRNAs were detected. Among the 288 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 88 lncRNAs related to metabolism were screened, and their potential functions in lipid metabolism, collagen remodeling, and protein transport were predicted. The age-dependent expression patterns of some lncRNAs were verified through qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) experiments, which initially revealed the status and role of lncRNAs in metabolic regulation in yak liver. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic adaptation in high-altitude species such as yak, and establishes a methodological framework for the screening and identification of functional lncRNAs in non-model organisms.

SO NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel pectic polysaccharide with dual backbones (SHP-A, 15,866 Da) was isolated from Sinopodophyllum hexandrum fruits. This polysaccharide is a heteropolymer composed of six monosaccharides. Structural characterization based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and other methods demonstrated that SHP-A features a unique architecture consisting of a rhamnogalacturonan-I backbone (alternating alpha-GalpA and alpha-Rha molecules with beta-Galp/alpha-Araf side chains) and a beta-glucomannan backbone (alternating beta-Manp and beta-Glcp molecules), interconnected via beta-Galp bridges. Bioactivity assays showed that SHP-A exerts potent immunomodulatory effects by enhancing macrophage phagocytosis and nitric oxide release. Transcriptomics analyses and NOD1 inhibitor interventions confirmed that SHP-A can activate the NOD1/RIPK2/NF-kappa B axis and induce M1 polarization in RAW264.7 macrophages, thereby upregulating various cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, SHP-A also appeared to enhance immune function through mitochondrial metabolism, which indicated its potential as an immunomodulatory agent that can be used in the development of immune-enhancing health foods in the future.

AB Establishing a simple and effective method for the visual detection of formaldehyde plays an important role in environmental emergency monitoring. In this work, L-cysteine-stabilized copper clusters were synthesized via a green, mild, and facile one-step preparation method. Through the optimization of reaction conditions, including reactant concentration and pH, the clusters exhibited stable red fluorescence. Upon exposure to formaldehyde, the fluorescence intensity of copper clusters gradually quenched with increasing formaldehyde concentration, enabling the development of a visual detection method that was successfully applied to analyze formaldehyde samples in air. Furthermore, by immobilizing the copper clusters into hydrogels, the visual detection performance and portability of the material were significantly enhanced. This method offers the advantages of simple preparation and rapid and accurate determination, demonstrating potential for semi-quantitative field detection of formaldehyde in emergency scenarios.

AB Selenium (Se) contamination may pose significant challenges to agricultural sustainability and food security in Se-rich environments. The potential of nitric oxide (NO) in improving Se tolerance in barley was investigated in this study. Selenium stress greatly increased endogenous NO content in barley, while exogenous NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP) limited Se uptake by downregulating the expression of HvPT gene. Additionally, NO accelerated Se metabolism by upregulating the expression of HvSIR, HvCS, HvC gamma S, and HvC beta L genes, thereby raising the proportion of organic Se in barley to 86.6 %. NO altered Se distribution by facilitating the translocation from nascent tissues to less active tissues, and shifted Se distribution from the soluble fraction to the cell wall at the subcellular level. SNP significantly upregulated antioxidant-related genes (Cu/Zn SOD, APX, GSH-Px), and elevated the content of non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH, AsA). These protective effects were abolished by NO scavenger (cPTIO), confirming the specific role of NO. Additionally, NO alleviated Se-induced growth inhibition by enhancing root vigor, respiration rate, and proline accumulation. Overall, this study highlights the role of NO in modulating Se metabolism and antioxidant defenses in barley and provides novel insights for optimizing Se-enriched crops.

AB The fused-ring gamma-butyrolactones are widespread occurrences in numerous pharmacologically active molecules. In this paper, a highly efficient method for the synthesis of fused-ring gamma-butyrolactone derivatives via a direct reaction of deconjugated butenolides with alpha '-substituted alpha, beta-unsaturated enones using Cs2CO3 as catalyst, has been successfully developed. A series of fused-ring gamma-butyrolactones have been obtained in moderate to good yields with good diastereoselectivities (up to >19/1 dr). Preliminary mechanistic studies have suggested that the reaction likely undergoes a Michael/Michael cascade pathway.

AB To our knowledge, the triacylglycerol (TAG) composition of giant panda milk fats (GPMFs) and its variation across lactation stages remain uncharacterized. In this study, TAG profiles of GPMFs during different lactation stages were assayed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 107 TAGs were identified in GPMFs, including those with acyl carbon number (ACN) of 26-62 and double bond (DB) of 0-10. TAG 52:2 (ACN:DB) showed the highest abundance (8.55 %-13.35 %), with oleic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid as its components. Interestingly, TAG profiles at 23 d still exhibited transitional characteristics via multivariate analysis. In colostrum, TAGs had a higher degree of unsaturation. Compared to mature milk, colostrum exhibited significantly higher levels of TAGs with 3-6 DBs and those with ACN of 52 and 54. Uncovering variation in GPMFs during lactation can provide a foundation for developing specific milk fat substitutes.

ID HUMAN ACTION RECOGNITION
AB Human motion prediction and action recognition are critical tasks in computer vision and human-computer interaction, supporting applications in surveillance, robotics, and behavioral analysis. However, effectively capturing the fine-grained semantics and dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies of human skeleton movements remains challenging due to the complexity of coordinated joint and part-level interactions over time. To address these issues, we propose a spatiotemporal skeleton modeling framework that integrates a Part-Joint Attention (PJA) mechanism with a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (Dynamic GCN). The proposed framework first employs a multi-granularity sequence encoding module to extract joint-level motion details and part-level semantics, enabling rich feature representations. The PJA module adaptively highlights critical joints and body parts across temporal sequences, enhancing the model's focus on salient regions while maintaining temporal coherence. Additionally, the Dynamic GCN dynamically constructs and updates inter-joint spatial relationships based on temporal feature similarities, facilitating effective spatiotemporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines across various prediction horizons. Specifically, it achieves a Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) of 10.2 mm at 80 ms and 57.5 mm at 400 ms, outperforming the best baseline by 9-12 percentage relative improvement across diverse actions. These results indicate the proposed method's ability to accurately capture both subtle and large-scale human motions while maintaining temporal stability. This work advances the development of interpretable and precise skeleton-based motion modeling and can benefit broader domains such as real-time human-robot interaction, intelligent surveillance, and behavior recognition in practical environments.

AB Through long-term natural and artificial selection, domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) have diverged from wild ancestors and become vital to high-altitude pastoralism, providing meat, milk, fiber, and other essential resources and transportation. Especially, based on the complex and changeable environments in the canyon of the Tibetan Plateau, the canyon-type yaks show diverse phenotypic traits, including morphology, production, and adaptation. To explore the genetic basis of this breed-specific adaptation and identify key functional genes shaped by selection, we collected 225 yaks from three canyon-type yak populations and scanned genome variation information using high-throughput resequencing. We employed three approaches, nucleotide diversity (pi), fixation index (Fst) and cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XPEHH), to detect positive selection signals in the genome. Through analyses of population structure, genetic diversity, and selection sweep signals, we identified unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that reveal significant genomic divergence among the three yak populations, which can also serve as genetic markers for population discrimination. Furthermore, shared SNPs identified by selective sweep analysis exhibited distinctive Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) distribution patterns; these population-specific SNP markers can be directly applied to develop SNP chips for breed-specific identification. A total of 13 genes related to breed-specific adaptive traits were identified. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular signatures of breed-specific adaptation under human management and natural selection. It also identifies key functional genes relevant to future breeding programs.

AB This study explored the effects of 36-hour acute sleep deprivation on the functional connectivity of auditory-related brain regions in healthy young males, examining its associations with alertness and emotional states. Sixty participants were assessed before and after sleep deprivation using psychomotor vigilance tasks, sleepiness scales, mood scales, and resting-state fMRI. The findings indicated significant changes in the functional connectivity of auditory-related brain regions, involving multiple cognitive, emotional, and motor areas. Further correlation analysis revealed a complex relationship between auditory-related brain regions and alertness, sleepiness, and mood. This study provides new evidence on how sleep deprivation influences auditory-related brain function.

ID CELL SELF-RENEWAL; TESTES
AB Cattleyak is a hybrid between cattle and yak; the underlying mechanism for its spermatogenic arrest is still unclear, and it's a typical male sterile mammal. In this work, we cloned the OTUD6A gene of cattleyak and analyzed it by bioinformatics. The expression level of OTUD6A in testicular tissues and undifferentiated spermatogonia of cattleyak was significantly lower than that in yak (p < 0.05). Overexpression of OTUD6A in cattleyak promoted the viability and proliferation activity of cattleyak undifferentiated spermatogonia (p < 0.05). Furthermore, OTUD6A overexpression resulted in significant upregulation of genes associated with proliferation (p < 0.05). Therefore, the aberrant expression of OTUD6A in undifferentiated spermatogonia of cattleyak impaired its proliferation and decreased its growth potentiality, thereby affecting the development of undifferentiated spermatogonia. This study provided a new theoretical basis for further elucidation of the molecular mechanism of spermatogenesis arrest in cattleyak.

ID NEGATIVE AFFECT; POSITIVE AFFECT; HEALTH; AGE
AB Self-control (SC) is a robust predictor of subjective well-being (SWB), and a positive linear relationship between them is often taken as the default assumption. However, some perspectives suggest that excessive SC may diminish SWB, implying an inverted U-shaped relationship. This study examined this inverted U-shaped hypothesis among Chinese adolescents, who are raised in a culture emphasizing moderation. We analyzed five samples (total N = 25,936), including four cross-sectional samples, two of which were nationally representative, and a three-wave longitudinal sample collected over two years. Participants ranged from middle school to university students, with SC assessed via self- and parent-report, and SWB through multiple indicators including positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, and one-item happiness assessment. Quadratic regression analyses and Simonsohn's two-lines test found no inverted U-shaped relationship between SC and SWB in five samples. Instead, SC consistently correlated positively with SWB across samples, regardless of measurement methods or whether data were cross-sectional or longitudinal. These findings reinforce the notion that higher SC contributes to greater SWB, with no indication of an inverted U-shape in Chinese culture. Encouraging the development of SC in adolescents might be a beneficial approach to enhancing long-term well-being, without concerns about unintended negative consequences.

AB The integration of intelligent transportation system in vehicular edge computing (VEC), powered by 5G, plays a vital role in enhancing supply chain systems (SCSs). It facilitates real-time communication and offloading tasks to edge servers, boosting logistics and optimizing transportation efficiency. However, conventional task offloading techniques in VEC cannot dynamically adapt or retrain models to respond to the ever-changing supply chain environment. To address this challenge, this study proposes a vehicular multitasking edge computing offloading algorithm based on meta-reinforcement learning (VMRL). This algorithm models complex vehicular tasks in SCS, using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), to meet the processing requirements of high-demand applications. Furthermore, by leveraging meta-reinforcement learning, VMRL quickly adapts to dynamically changing logistics demands and transportation conditions in the supply chain, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the VEC offloading strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the VMRL algorithm significantly improves system efficiency, reduces the offload delay, improves overall responsiveness and stability of the supply chain, and facilitates more intelligent and automated management of the SCS.

AB Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem. (A. elata), a deciduous shrub in the Araliaceae family, is a prized wild edible vegetable among residents in the upper reaches of the Dadu-Minjiang River. Its tender shoots are valued for their unique flavor and rich nutrition, serving not only as an edible plant but also as an economic crop with medicinal properties. This study utilized an ensemble model to simulate the potential distribution of A. elata in this region, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, and ecological niche. Additionally, a cultivation productivity evaluation model integrating ecological suitability and nutritional components was developed to delineate potential cultivation areas. Results showed that high-suitability habitats of A. elata span 0.64 x 104km(2), primarily in block-shaped distributions in Tianquan and Baoxing Counties, with fragmented patchy and linear distributions at the junctions of Maoxian-Songpan and Maoxian-Heishui Counties, as well as within Songpan County. First-level cultivation areas, covering 0.33 x 104km(2), are mainly located in eastern Tianquan and southern Baoxing Counties. Under future climate scenarios, the areas of potential suitable habitats and cultivation zones for A. elata will gradually expand with increasing temperatures, migrating toward higher-altitude regions, accompanied by enhanced niche migration. Extreme emission scenarios significantly improve core habitat quality, as indicated by these trends. Collectively, these findings provide a theoretical basis for the sustainable utilization of A. elata in the upper Dadu-Minjiang River region.

AB This study investigates the dynamic compression behavior of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-processed Ni-based superalloy GH3230 across a wide range of strain rates (1482 - 6893 s(-1)) and temperatures (-150 - 750 degrees C) using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) system. The mechanical test results revealed that as the strain rate increased from 1482 s(-1) to 6893 s(-1), the peak true stress increased from 895 MPa to 1853 MPa, with an increase of 107 %, exhibiting a significant strain rate strengthening effect. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the enhanced dislocation interactions and reduced dynamic recovery capacity. Microstructural analysis demonstrates that increasing the strain rate promotes a transition from columnar to equiaxed grain morphology through dynamic recrystallization and grain fragmentation, reducing the average grain size from 35.7 mu m to 2.36 mu m. In contrast, temperature exerts a weaker influence on grain evolution: while thermal softening decreases peak stress at elevated temperatures, recrystallized fractions remain below 5 % across all tested temperatures due to the short deformation time in SHPB tests. EBSD-based texture analysis showed strain rate-induced weakening of the initial <001>//build direction (BD) texture and gradual orientation homogenization, accompanied by increased dislocation density and intragranular misorientation. These findings underscore the dominant role of strain rate in governing both the mechanical response and microstructural evolution, whereas temperature primarily affects deformation resistance through thermal activation.

AB Non-human primates (NHPs) are close relatives of humans and can serve as hosts for many zoonotic pathogens. They play crucial role in spreading antimicrobial resistant bacteria (AMR) to humans across various ecological niches. The spread of antimicrobial resistance in NHPs may complicate wildlife conservation efforts, as it may threaten domestic livestock, endangered species as well as human's health. This review analyses the existing literature on the prevalence of AMR in NHP species, including Rhinopithecus roxellana, Macaca fascicularis, and Sapajus nigritus, to create awareness in all stake holders involve in the fight against AMR on the serious potential threats that these primates pose. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed (National Library of Medicine-NLM), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), Springer Link (Springer), and Science Direct (Elsevier) databases until January, 2025. The search strategy combined terms from the areas of non-human primates, antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial resistance, and antibacterial resistance genes (ARGs). Studies that isolated bacteria from NHPs and assessed phenotypic resistance to specific antibiotics as well as studies that identified ARGs in bacteria isolated from NHPs were included. Data were synthesised thematically across all included studies. Results: A total of 37 studies were included (explained as Cercopithecidae (n = 23), Callithrix (n = 6), Cebidae (n = 4), Hominidae (n = 3), and Atelidae (n = 1)). The results showed that the most common ARB across the various NHPs and geographical settings was Staphylococcus spp. (45.95%) and Escherichia spp. (29.73%). The tested antibiotics that showed high levels of resistance in NHPs included Tetracycline (40.54%), Ciprofloxacin (32.43%), and Erythromycin (24.34%), whereas ermC, tetA, tetM, aadA, aph (3 '')-II, and qnrS1 were the most widely distributed antibiotic resistance genes in the studies. Conclusion: NHPs are potential natural reservoirs of AMR, therefore global policy makers should consider making NHPs an indicator species for monitoring the spread of ARB.

AB Simple Summary Yaks, native to high-altitude regions, hold significant economic and research value, yet exhibit lower reproductive capacity and reduced sperm motility compared to cattle. The epididymis, where sperm maturation occurs, features the cauda region as the primary storage site, with cauda epididymal fluid secreted by epithelial cells forming the microenvironment for sperm maturation. This study used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics to analyze and compare cauda epididymal fluid components between yaks and cattle. We found that under positive and negative ion detection modes, 1098 and 1297 metabolites were identified, respectively, with the most abundant categories being organic acids and derivatives, organoheterocyclic compounds, and lipids and lipid-like molecules. Compared with cattle, yak cauda epididymal fluid showed 79 significantly upregulated and 212 downregulated metabolites in the positive ion mode, and 110 upregulated and 230 downregulated metabolites in the negative ion mode. Among the differentially expressed metabolites across both species, a total of 14 metabolites positively correlated with sperm motility or functional maturation while four negatively associated with them. Our results establish a valuable metabolomic reference dataset for yak reproductive biology and provide new insights into the molecular regulation of sperm function.Abstract The epididymis is crucial for sperm maturation, with its caudal region storing mature sperm. Yaks show poorer sperm motility and higher abnormality rates than cattle, but the metabolic mechanisms remain unknown. This study compared cauda epididymal fluid metabolites between six yaks and six cattle using untargeted metabolomics. A total of 1098 and 1297 metabolites types annotated by the Human Metabolome Database were identified in yak and cattle cauda epididymal fluid, respectively, using positive and negative ion modes. The Yak cauda epididymal fluid exhibited distinct metabolic profiles compared with cattle. A total of 79 metabolites were upregulated and 212 were downregulated in the positive ion mode, while 110 were upregulated and 230 were downregulated in the negative ion mode. Among these, 14 metabolites were reported to promote sperm quality, function or metabolism by reducing oxidative stress, blocking premature sperm capacitation and spontaneous acrosome reaction, enhancing mitochondrial energy metabolism or facilitating flagellar motility in cattle or other species. Four were reported to impair the quality or function of sperm via increasing the DNA methylation, inhibiting spermatozoa motility, upregulating the ROS levels and diminishing sperm motility. Taken together, this study established a valuable metabolomic reference dataset for yak reproductive biology and provided new insights into the molecular regulation of sperm function.

AB Biodiesel is widely regarded as a viable alternative to fossil fuels and a strategic approach to mitigating climate change. Its production, primarily through the transesterification of plant-or waste-based biomass, is influenced by a variety of experimental factors, including catalyst type, reaction temperature, and feedstock properties. However, conducting the optimization of experimental procedures and comprehensive environmental assessment remains challenging due to the diversity of feedstocks and the variability in reaction conditions, which introduce significant complexity and uncertainty in increasing the production of biodiesel while reducing its environmental impact. To address this challenge, in this work, the integration of machine learning (ML) and life cycle assessment (LCA) in biodiesel production offers a powerful approach to improving both environmental and economic performance. We compared the predictive accuracy of five ML models for biodiesel yield based on transesterification reaction. The results indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network could be a more suitable model for accurate biodiesel yield prediction because of its lowest validation RMSE (5.667) and highest correlation coefficient value (0.9165). In addition, we analyzed the environmental impact of different biomass conversion though LCA. The LCA showed methanol consumption contributed over 90 % of environmental impacts in virgin oils, while waste cooking oil's main burden came from regeneration, contributing 41.0-99.9 % depending on the impact category. This ML-LCA coupling not only improves the accuracy of process optimization but also provides a holistic view of environmental trade-offs across diverse feedstocks, paving the way for smarter and greener biodiesel production strategies.

AB Background: Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a critical porcine herpesvirus, induces severe diseases in both livestock and wildlife, imposing an incalculable burden and economic losses in livestock production. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary mechanisms and host adaptation strategies of the PRV gB gene through genomic alignment. The gB gene is highly conserved in PRV, and its encoded gB protein exhibits functional interchangeability across different herpesvirus species. Notably, the gB protein elicits the production of both complement-dependent and complement-independent neutralizing antibodies in animals, while also being closely associated with syncytium formation. Methods: Phylogenetic analysis and codon usage pattern analysis were performed in this study. A total of 110 gB gene sequences were analyzed, which were collected from [2011 to 2024] across the following regions: [Fujian, Shanxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, Chongqing, Henan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Huzhou, Shandong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu (China)], [Budapest, Szeged (Hungary)], [Tokyo (Japan)], [London (United Kingdom)], [Athens (Greece)], [Berlin (Germany)], and [New Jersey (United States)]. Results: The gB gene of PRV employs an evolutionary "selective optimization" strategy to maintain a dynamic balance between ensuring functional expression and evading host immune pressure, with this core trend strongly supported by its codon usage bias and mutation characteristics. First, the gene exhibits significant codon usage bias [Effective Number of Codons (ENC) = 27.94 +/- 0.1528], driven primarily by natural selection rather than mere mutational pressure. Second, phylogenetic analysis shows that the second codon position of gB has the highest mutation rate (1.0586)-a feature closely linked to its antigenic variation and immune escape capabilities, further reflecting adaptive evolution against host immune pressure. Additionally, ENC-GC3 plot analysis reveals the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying codon bias formation, providing molecular evidence for the "selective optimization" strategy and clarifying PRV's core evolutionary path to balance functional needs and immune pressure over time. Conclusions: Our study findings deepen our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of PRV and provide theoretical support for designing vaccines and assessing the risk of cross-species transmission.

AB As a major pathogenic fungus of the Rhizopodaceae family, Rhizopus arrhizus can infect humans and lead to severe outcomes, including life-threatening systemic infections. In this study, a fungal strain designated XML01 was isolated from a goat specimen. Following cultivation on potato dextrose agar (PDA), the isolate was identified as Rhizopus arrhizus through lactophenol cotton blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and ITS gene sequencing. To investigate the pulmonary pathogenicity and mechanistic underpinnings of this strain, a murine model was established and analyzed using histopathological techniques (HE and Gomori's methenamine silver staining), RT-qPCR, and transcriptome sequencing. Infection with R. arrhizus resulted in significant pulmonary damage, characterized by alveolar wall thickening, severe hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and interstitial hyperplasia. Transcriptome analysis revealed 318 significantly differentially expressed genes, predominantly enriched in pathways related to ciliary motility, cGMP-PKG signaling, and calcium homeostasis-indicating profound disruption of normal lung function. Key downregulated genes were associated with the IL-17 and B-cell receptor signaling pathways. Notably, SftpC and GSN were significantly upregulated, while Fth1, Scgb3a1, and Scgb1a1 were downregulated, findings that were consistent with RT-qPCR validation. Collectively, this work provides a novel and highly reproducible animal model that deepens the understanding of pathogenesis and offers a valuable tool for the development of new therapies for mucormycosis.

AB Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are a population of cells with self-renewal and self-differentiation capacities, widely recognized as critical for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Accordingly, eliminating LCSCs is considered a viable strategy for HCC treatment. However, conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy struggle to eradicate LCSCs, underscoring the critical need for LCSC-targeted therapies. Nanotechnology offers unique advantages for LCSC targeting via the selective delivery of drugs to tumor sites. Various engineered nanomedicines-including polymeric nanoparticles, biological nanomaterials, and inorganic nanoparticles-have been developed for their elimination. This article primarily reviews the biological concepts and biomarkers of LCSCs. In addition, it summarizes various strategies for targeting LCSCs using engineered nanomedicines.

AB Purpose To curb and reverse the rapidly expanding desertification and enhance ecosystem functioning, various restoration strategies have been adopted in desertified regions of China. Optimizing those efforts requires an evaluation of their impacts on biodiversity and network complexity. However, the role of bipartite interaction between plants and rhizosphere microbes in driving the soil multifunctionality during restoration is poorly understood. Methods We examined the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal diversity associated with 14 plant species distributed along a 54-year chronosequence following the implementation of straw checkerboard barriers in the Tengger Desert, China. We also analyzed the architecture of bipartite interaction networks and relationship with soil multifunctionality. We used 12 soil functions relating to the C, N and P cycling to assess soil multifunctionality. Results Our findings revealed a significant increase in soil multifunctionality (p < 0.001) and fungal diversity (p < 0.01) during restoration. In contrast, bacterial diversity did not follow this pattern; instead, declined sharply during late restoration stage. The plant-fungi bipartite network properties exhibited a significant increase, followed by enhancing the soil multifunctionality (p < 0.05). In addition, at functional diversity level, the OTU richness of fungal saprotrophs associated positively with soil multifunctionality (p < 0.001). Consistent with diversity, the architecture of plant-bacteria bipartite network exhibited no significant directional shifts during restoration and showed minimal functional coupling to soil multifunctionality. The structural random forest modelling approach further confirmed these results, accounting for 70.01% variation and identifying fungi as key driver of soil multifunctionality. Conclusion Our research underscores the effectiveness of artificial straw checkerboard barriers in enhancing the fungal diversity-soil multifunctionality relationship mediated by plant-fungi association during restoration.

AB Current studies are difficult to provide investors with accurate benefit evaluation and guidance strategies for solar hybrid systems under different climates and building types with the goal of maximizing economic benefits. Meanwhile, traditional methods usually conduct local optimum of system economy through single-stage solution and limited case comparison. To address these gaps, a two-stage co-optimization method is proposed for solar hybrid combined cooling, heating and power (SHCCHP) systems with energy storage. Unlike traditional methods, this method co-optimizes the system design and operation parameters based on a comprehensive objective from three dimensions. Based on three typical buildings in seven cities in China, the multi-dimensional benefits, energy matching and renewable energy contribution are studied for the optimized systems in different climates and buildings. The system application recommendations and design guidance methods are further obtained under different climates and building types. The results indicate that: (1) Compared to other scenarios, the normalized optimal capacities of key devices decrease by 12.7-50.4% in hot-summer and warm-winter region or offices, while they decrease by 19.7-33.9% under photovoltaic schemes. (2) For device output optimization, as the load rate increases, the load ratio of heat storage device decreases, while the load ratios of other four devices increase first and then decrease. (3) Among three variables, climate region and design scheme have significant effect on the system multi-dimensional benefits and energy supply efficiency. The above results provide crucial references and guidance for evaluating the application benefits and optimizing design and strategy of SHCCHP systems in different climates and buildings.

AB Background The yak is a unique livestock species bred on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We utilized genotypic data obtained from the yak sequencing chip "Qingxin-1" and phenotypic data measured from image photographs using conversion between pixel and distance. The primary objective of this study was to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using five models to analyze seven body size traits. Specifically, the goals were to (1) characterize the genetic structure of three major yak breeds: Maiwa, Yushu, and Huanhu; (2) identify candidate genes that significantly influence yak body size traits; and (3) compare the prediction accuracy of single-trait and multi-trait genomic selection(GS). Results A total of 94 markers were significantly (P<1e-05) associated with yak body size traits. GWAS results revealed that PRKAA2 and SNX9 were important candidate genes affecting the body size traits of yaks. The GS results indicated that combining marker-assisted selection and best linear unbiased prediction significantly improved the accuracy of predicting body size traits, the average accuracy in multi-trait GS was higher than that in single-trait GS. Conclusions Our findings provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture underlying yaks, with implications for the development and selection of yak body size traits. The identification of key genes such as PRKAA2 and SNX9 offers promising targets for breeding programs aimed at optimizing body size traits, thereby supporting genetic improvements in yak populations.

AB Global warming has induced significant shifts in spatiotemporal environmental patterns of plants. P. asiatica, highly prized for its edible and medicinal value, is widely harvested and utilized by residents in the upper reaches of the Dadu River and Minjiang River. This study employed ensemble models to simulate the potential distribution of P. asiatica in this region, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution and niche. Additionally, a production dynamics model integrating the synergistic effects of ecological suitability and nutritional components of P. asiatica was developed to delineate its current and future potential cultivation zones. The results revealed the following: (1) Currently, both suitable habitats and cultivation zones of P. asiatica are primarily distributed in low-altitude river valley areas within the upper reaches of the Minjiang River and Dadu River. (2) In future periods, high-quality suitable habitats and cultivation zones of P. asiatica will increase to varying degrees, with its niche exhibiting a trend of migration toward higher-altitude regions. (3) Under the SSP5-8.5 climate emission scenario, the areas of suitable habitats and cultivation zones of P. asiatica will experience the greatest expansion, accompanied by the largest amplitude of niche migration. This study will facilitate the formulation of suitability-based management strategies for P. asiatica in the upper reaches of the Dadu River and Minjiang River, and provide a scientific reference for the sustainable utilization of mountain plant resources under climate change.

AB With accelerating digital transformation, firms must renew how they create, deliver, and capture value to remain competitive and to advance sustainable competitiveness. This study examines how ambidextrous market orientation drives digital business model innovation (DBMI) through the mediating role of digital resource bricolage and the moderating effect of environmental turbulence. Using survey data and structural equation modeling (SEM), we find that both proactive and responsive market orientations positively affect DBMI. Digital resource bricolage partially mediates both relationships, with a stronger mediation effect for responsive orientation. Environmental turbulence strengthens the association between ambidextrous market orientation and digital resource bricolage. Complementing variable-centric tests, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) identifies three configurational pathways sufficient for high DBMI, revealing alternative routes to business-model renewal under different contextual conditions. The findings extend ambidextrous market orientation research to digital contexts, enrich the resource-recombination perspective on DBMI, and provide actionable guidance for firms seeking to orchestrate data, platforms, and legacy assets to reconfigure activity systems. By clarifying when and how market sensing and shaping translate into effective digital recombination, this study informs strategies for sustainable competitiveness in turbulent environments.

AB The addition of yak dung into alpine meadows is a crucial pathway for returning nutrients and microorganisms to enhance plant productivity and soil fertility. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) play a dominant role in nitrification, which regulates the central process in nitrogen (N) cycle of grassland ecosystems. However, the dynamic effects of yak dung addition on AOB and AOA communities, and their regulatory roles in the N cycle of alpine meadows, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of varying amounts of yak dung additions (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 kg/m(2)) on plant community characteristics, soil physiochemical properties, and the communities of AOB and AOA in an alpine meadow on the east Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Yak dung addition had distinct effects on different plant functional groups. Structural equation modeling revealed that it directly suppressed aboveground plant communities and soil available nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-), while indirectly influencing both AOB and AOA communities. Yak dung-induced changes in soil physicochemical properties positively affected the community structure and stability of AOB and AOA. During dung decomposition, AOA responded more sensitively in regulating the N cycle, whereas AOB exhibited greater adaptability to N fluctuations in alpine meadows. Our findings highlight the importance of microbe-driven N cycling in shaping plant productivity and soil fertility, offering practical insights for grazing and fertilization management in alpine grassland ecosystems.

AB Ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) transforms waste plastic-derived chemicals into high-value products, representing an upcycling strategy that enhances resource efficiency. Pt-based electrocatalysts have shown promise for oxidizing ethylene glycol (EG) to high-value glycolic acid (GA), but they still suffer from high Pt usage, limited activity and stability, and poor low-potential selectivity. In this work, we report a highly dispersed PtBiCoAgSn multi-component alloy (MCA) electrocatalyst (denoted as MCA-PtBiCoAgSn) with outstanding catalytic activity and deactivation resistance, demonstrating a remarkable EGOR mass activity of 16.65 A mg(Pt)(-1) at 0.76 V vs. RHE, which is 8-fold higher than that of commercial Pt/C (2.03 A mg(Pt)(-1)). Also, it can maintain an EGOR current density of 4.89 A mg(Pt)(-1) after an extended long-term stability test. Additionally, it shows superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2 products compared to Pt/C across the potential window of 0.5 similar to 0.9 V vs. RHE, with the FE of GA being up to 91% at a very low potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE. Moreover, in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy in a thin-layer configuration confirmed that EGOR proceeds via the C2 pathway on MCA-PtBiCoAgSn surfaces. This work may provide new insights into the design of high-efficiency and low-cost EGOR catalysts.

AB To express and purify staphylococcal enterotoxin M (SEM) using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), a signal peptide-truncated (Delta Nsp) wild-type SEM (SEMWT) was N-terminally fused in pET-28a(+) to a polyhistidine tag (His(6x)-) and thrombin cleavage site (TCS; LVPR down arrow GS), generating His(6x)-TCS-Delta NspSEM(WT). Unexpectedly, 4 degrees C desalting reduced the fusion protein's molecular weight by similar to 2.0 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry identified cleavage specifically at the arginine (R) and glycine (G) peptide bond (R-G bond) within the TCS motif. AlphaFold 3 revealed an exposed serine protease catalytic triad: histidine 172, serine 178, and aspartic acid 212 (H-172/S-178/D-212) in the beta-grasp domain, suggesting intrinsic thrombin-like activity (TLA). Sequential IMAC and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) purification eliminated contaminant concerns, while chromogenic substrate S-2238 (S-2238) assays demonstrated increasing specific activity and purification fold, supporting intrinsic TLA. Critically, the mutation of serine at position 178 to alanine (His(6x)-TCS-Delta NspSEM(S178A)) abolished TLA but preserved the secondary/tertiary structure, confirming the activity's origin within the wild-type construct. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations probed the atomistic mechanism for specific R-G bond cleavage. This work establishes a foundation for understanding Delta NspSEM(WT)'s TLA.

AB In traditional research, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), as the mainstream learning strategy in adaptive linear/nonlinear optimal estimation, is prone to severe oscillations in the region of the local minimum saddle point when dealing with the analysis of linear/nonlinear systems, resulting in a significant decline in convergence efficiency. Although combining SGD with the spline adaptive filter (SAF) has brought some optimizations, it is still challenging to overcome the limitation of local minimum saddle points, which significantly restricts the algorithm's performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes the SAF-WSGD algorithm, which is based on the Whiplash SGD method (WSGD). This algorithm leverages the unique acceleration mechanism of WSGD, which enables it to effectively bypass saddle point obstacles that are challenging to overcome with traditional methods, thereby significantly accelerating convergence speed. Through theoretical analysis, numerical modeling experiments, and verification using public datasets, this algorithm demonstrates excellent convergence performance in both time-varying and time-invariant systems, as well as in environments with both non-Gaussian and Gaussian noise. It provides a reliable solution for estimating nonlinear systems.

The adsorption of H2 on the outside wall of (9,0) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT(9,0)) were studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The tiny adsorption energy (0.023 eV) implied a high barrier of the adsorption of H2 on the outer wall of pure SWCNT, so metal atom (Pt, Fe, Ni) was used to decorate SWCNT. The result showed that Pt-SWCNT(9,0) exhibited the highest hydrogen adsorption capacity (0.791 eV) and meanwhile as the most stable catalyst structure. The hydrogen molecule underwent adsorption and dissociation on all three systems. Furthermore, the electronic structures of Pt-SWCNT(9,0) and H2/Pt-SWCNT(9,0) were discussed. It is interesting that the interaction between Pt atom and SWCNT(9,0) changed the electronic state of carbon nanotubes and enhanced the adsorption energy of H2. In the configurations involving multiple H2 molecules, most molecules exhibited physical adsorption on Pt-SWCNT(9,0), whereas only one molecule was chemical adsorption. The electron transfer of Pt was promoted with the enhancement of orbital hybridization. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO gap (Eg) increased and the conductivity (sigma) of Pt-SWCNT(9,0) changed after the adsorption of H2, which was according with the experimental studies. Our calculations reveal that Pt-decorated SWCNT(9,0) has the capabilities of hydrogen adsorption and sensing. In the future, the design of the material structure will tune the conductivity for better H-2 sensor.MethodsAll DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 16 software. GaussView 6.0 software was utilized to visualize the molecular models, molecular orbitals, and electrostatic potential (ESP) of all relevant species. Multiwfn 3.8 software was utilized to plot localized orbital locator (LOL) graph and electron localization function (ELF) distribution maps. The DFT method was the B3LYP-D3BJ. The 6-31G(d,p) basis set was utilized for the C, H atoms, and Lanl2dz basis set for the Pt, Fe, and Ni atoms. No extraneous computational parameters were used in the structure optimization and frequency calculation that could affect calculation accuracy in the gas phase.

AB Emotional communication is crucial for maintaining the romantic relationships of couples, particularly in situations of failed cooperation. However, little is known about how expressions of happiness and anger affect the subsequent behavioural performance of couples and their neural synchrony mechanisms in the context of cooperative failure. To address this, lover dyads were asked to perform a cooperative task with a high probability of failure while viewing their partner's happy or angry expressions as feedback. Meanwhile, neural activity was recorded via functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results showed that happy expressions promote intraindividual emotional experience, emotional similarity, and cooperative performance more than do angry expressions, and such a facilitated effect was associated with higher interpersonal neural synchronization (INS) in the right Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) and lower INS at right Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG). These findings can guide emotional communication strategies for couples in managing failures and promoting positive interactions.

AB The oxidation resistance of structural materials in high-temperature corrosive environments is critical for nuclear fusion reactors. This study investigates the surface physical oxidation state of Fe9Cr-based alloys from the evolution of spin-states by X-ray emission spectra. Herein, a series of in-situ heating experiments in highly concentrated nitrogen and atmosphere environments were carried out on Fe9Cr, reduced-activation ferritic/ martensitic (RAFM) and oxide dispersion strengthened ferritic (RAFM-ODS) alloys. The K(3 ' related spin states of Fe ions at different temperatures were observed. The results showed K(3 ' was discovered at a higher temperature and grew with increasing temperatures and oxygen concentration. The occurrence temperature K(3 ' peak of RAFM-ODS is higher than others, indicating superior oxidation resistance. In comparison with the K(3 spectra of Fe-O compounds, it was found that the stronger K(3 ' corresponds to higher oxidation states, attributed to the more unpaired 3d electrons in high-valence Fe. The interesting findings offer a new insight into the physical mechanisms underlying the high-temperature oxidation of Fe9Cr-based alloys from the evolution of spin-states.

AB Introduction Monitoring the growth status and aboveground biomass of wild and cultivated medicinal herbs remains a persistent challenge in precision agriculture.Methods In this study, we developed machine learning and deep learning models to estimate SPAD values and biomass of Lamiophlomis rotata (Benth.). The models used hyperspectral data and time-series phenotypic traits from 508 samples collected across different altitudes. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined from plant contours. The corresponding mean spectral profiles were then preprocessed. To improve feature selection, we proposed a Dynamic Reptile Search Algorithm-enhanced CARS (DRSA-CARS) method. This method integrates a dynamic behavioral strategy into the CARS framework to identify informative spectral bands. Vegetation indices (VIs) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture parameters were extracted and combined with spectral features to construct the PLSR, SVR, FNN, and CNN models.Results Compared to CARS, the DRSA-CARS method reduced feature dimensionality by up to 75.7% for SPAD and 29.2% for biomass, while improving prediction accuracy (R-2) by 24.4% and 34.7%, respectively. Among all models, the FNN achieved the highest performance, with R-2 values of 0.7732 (training) and 0.7502 (testing) for SPAD and 0.8260 and 0.7933 for biomass. Feature fusion further improved predictive accuracy by 11% for SPAD and 30% for biomass compared to models based on individual feature types.Discussion These results demonstrate that coupling DRSA-CARS-based feature selection with deep learning provides a robust, non-destructive approach for evaluating plant growth status. This framework highlights the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a rapid, reliable, non-invasive tool for precision cultivation of medicinal herbs.

AB Oil-water separation technology plays a pivotal role in advancing the efficient utilization of resources, fostering the development of green technologies, and promoting the circular economy. With the continuous evolution of technology and the expansion of application scenarios, microfluidic-based intelligent oil-water separation has demonstrated significant compatibility with the "dual carbon" goals and sustainable development strategies. This is achieved through enhanced separation efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and the recycling of resources. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the realization and enhancement of intelligent oil-water separation technology within microchannels, highlighting the methodologies and advantages of microfluidic separation. The intelligent separation mechanisms and technological implementations are elucidated, including the introduction of wettability gradients within microchannels and the incorporation of external stimuli responses, such as the polarization effect of electric fields on oil droplets. Furthermore, the application prospects of multifunctional integration and automated control in microchannels for achieving and strengthening intelligent oil-water separation are discussed. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of microfluidic intelligent oil-water separation technology in the context of green microchemical industries and global sustainable development are outlined.

AB To overcome the inherent limitations of wheat starch (WS) in processing applications, Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharides (CPP) were employed to modulate the physicochemical properties of WS. This study evaluated the effects of CPP (1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 10 %, w/w) on the gelatinization characteristics, rheological properties, structure, and digestibility of WS. The results demonstrated that the addition of CPP significantly enhanced both the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G ''), improving the thermal stability and viscoelasticity of the material. CPP increased the absolute zeta potential from 10.9 +/- 0.3 mV to 23.9 +/- 0.3 mV. Urea and NaCl experiments demonstrated that hydrogen bonding plays a slightly more significant role than electrostatic interactions in the CPP-WS composite system. The microstructure of the CPP-WS gel exhibited a porous structure. Furthermore, CPP addition reduced the starch hydrolysis rate to 62.66 % and decreased the glycemic index (GI) from 94.61 to 82.14, indicating its potential efficacy in delaying postprandial blood glucose elevation. This study confirms that CPP can effectively regulate the gelatinization, rheological, and digestive properties of WS, providing important theoretical foundations and practical guidance for developing low-GI functional starch-based foods.

AB Background Social anxiety is characterized by excessive sensitivity and concern about social evaluation. While previous research has demonstrated attentional bias and fear generalization in socially anxious individuals, the neural mechanisms by which different evaluative valences modulate this process remain unclear.Method This study employed a fear generalization paradigm combined with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Fifty-one college students were recruited and divided into high (n = 25) and low (n = 26) social anxiety groups. A face-evaluation paradigm was used to record both behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses during fear generalization.Results At the behavioral level, the high social anxiety group showed a broader fear generalization gradient. Both groups demonstrated higher unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings under negative versus positive evaluation conditions. This effect manifested differently between groups: in the high social anxiety group, it was specific to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) and generalization stimulus 4 (GS4), whereas in the low social anxiety group, it was observed for generalization stimulus 1 (GS1). At the neural level, SSVEP results revealed enhanced visual cortical activation (Oz, PO8) in the high social anxiety group across all stimuli. The PO7 electrode specifically reflected a differential modulation by evaluative valence between the groups; this adaptive modulation was evident in the low social anxiety group but absent in the high social anxiety group.Conclusion This study reveals that social anxiety is characterized by a sustained state of early visual hypervigilance. Critically, we provide neurophysiological evidence that a core deficit underlying this condition is an impaired ability to utilize positive evaluation to down-regulate this hypervigilance. These results redefine our understanding of the cognitive-neural mechanisms of social anxiety, shifting the focus toward deficits in the neural processing of positive social information, and suggest that interventions should aim to restore the adaptive processing of positive social feedback.

AB We successfully synthesized two copper complexes (CuL1 and CuL2) with N4-tetradentate salen ligands and encapsulated them within zeolite frameworks. Comprehensive characterization of both free and encapsulated complexes was performed using multiple analytical techniques. When employed as catalysts for H2O2-mediated rhodamine B degradation, CuL2 demonstrated superior activity, which we attribute to the electropositive character of its imidazole moiety. Notably, encapsulation-induced modifications were observed in both the optical properties and catalytic performance of the complexes, arising from the constraints of the zeolite supercage structure. Under optimized conditions, the zeolite-encapsulated CuL1-Y achieved 85% degradation efficiency, comparable to that of its free complex counterpart. Furthermore, the CuL1-Y system exhibited excellent recyclability.

TI Memristive hysteresis and stacking-fault-induced semiconductor to metal
   transition in sulfur-modified multiwall carbon nanotubes
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
LA English
DT Article
ID SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; GRAPHENE
AB The recent identification of superconductive phenomena in few-layer and multi-layer graphene systems has attracted significant attention. Superconductivity has also been reported to occur in pyrolytic graphite, where, together with the narrow-gap semiconducting Bernal (ABA) phase, a critical role is played by stacking-faults which behave either as metallic-like and/or granular superconducting regions. Here, we investigate the current vs. voltage properties of stacking-faults nucleated in multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by annealing with diluted amounts of sulfur. By employing a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we identify an interplay of semiconducting and metallic components in coexistence with memristive responses, with a local semiconducting to metallic transition occurring in the stacking-fault regions. The observed transition in the CNT-structure (the stacking-fault) is ascribed to a localized sulfur-induced modification of the graphitic stacking-order and partial amorphization of the CNT-walls, leading to a local structural-collapse of the CNT. Comparative investigations performed on highly crystalline graphitic multiwall CNTs and multilayered carbon nano-onions (with a turbostratic structure) revealed an important interplay of contributions arising from Bernal and turbostratic graphite-phases. This translates into a competing semiconducting and metallic behaviour in coexistence with the observed memristive characteristics.

AB The proliferation of mobile devices has intensified resource constraints on edge servers, revealing significant limitations in traditional mobile edge computing (MEC) for multi-task offloading scenarios. This has created a fundamental tension between stringent task deadlines and inherent system processing delays, which are further exacerbated by queuing dynamics in multi-task MEC environments. Unlike scenarios relying solely on cloud or MEC, the collaborative computing paradigm, where both resources are used in tandem, enables effective complementarity between nodes. This collaboration benefits multi-task offloading by dynamically meeting the demands of real-time task offloading and resource allocation. To address the diversity of task scenarios and the variations in data scale within MEC, and to mitigate the heightened task delay sensitivity resulting from multi-task queuing in MEC, this paper introduces a multi-task offloading cloud-edge collaborative computing system model(C3O). The system dynamically optimizes performance metrics by adjusting delay-payment weight ratios while preserving quality of service. It also incorporates a deadline-based dynamic weight queuing strategy and employs a deep Q-network (DQN) for making offloading decisions. Convex optimization is utilized to balance the weighted sum of payment cost and delay, with this balance serving as the reward signal to guide the agent towards optimal performance. Simulation results demonstrate that C3O is robust across various MEC application scenarios, effectively meeting dynamic resource allocation and delay requirements under multi-task offloading. Compared to other methods, C3O reduces task delay by 7% to 73% and the total task cost by 10% to 78%.

AB Psychological maltreatment has been shown to be positively associated with loneliness, and both are linked to children's mental health. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between psychological maltreatment and children's loneliness remain insufficiently understood. Perceived social support is linked to psychological maltreatment and may serve as a protective factor against loneliness, and psychological suzhi has been described as an essential and stable psychological quality that may moderate the effects of external factors on an individual's mental health. Thus, this study proposes and explores a moderated mediation model of psychological suzhi and perceived social support. The data were collected from a sample of 1122 students (550 boys, 572 girls) aged 9-13 years in China, and statistical analysis was done with SPSS 26.0. Results indicated that perceived social support partially mediated the association between psychological maltreatment and loneliness, while psychological suzhi weakened the indirect relationship between psychological maltreatment and loneliness via perceived social support. Research has indicated that psychological maltreatment may undermine perceived social support, which in turn relates to high levels of loneliness. Psychological suzhi may influence the detrimental effect of psychological maltreatment on perceived social support, and the protective effect of perceived social support on loneliness. These findings provide insights into potential directions for interventions and preventative actions aimed at Chinese children who have experienced psychological maltreatment.

AB The covalent conjugation of chitosan to beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) via Maillard reaction alters its structure and characteristics, providing a method to reduce allergenicity. The molecular weight (Mw) of chitosan plays a crucial role in the conjugation process, which in turn affects the desensitization effectiveness to beta Lg. The degree of conjugation decreased from 46.4 % +/- 2.6 % (beta C-1<bold>)</bold> to 27.6 % +/- 2.9 % (beta C-100) as the Mw increased from 1 kDa to 100 kDa. Notably, beta C-1 showed a significant reduction in beta-sheet content, resulting in a greater increase in surface hydrophobicity and improved thermostability compared to beta C-10 and beta C-100. Consequently, beta C-1 demonstrated the most effective desensitization, with the highest inhibition of immunoglobulin E (IgE) combining capacity and the best suppression of cytokine overproduction in KU812 cells. Additionally, the overexpression of IgE and inflammatory factors in mice was significantly suppressed after beta Lg was conjugated with chitosan, alleviating dysbiosis of gut microbiota at both phyla and family levels and lessening anaphylactic response to beta Lg. The desensitization effects were observed in the order of beta C-1 > beta C-10 > beta C-100.

AB Seedling regeneration is a key process for ecological recovery and the foundation for maintaining forest stability and sustainability. However, our understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors influence seedling survival is still incomplete, especially in Qinghai spruce forests that are highly sensitive to climate change. In this study, we compiled three years of data on 12,432 seedlings in Qinghai spruce forests on the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to evaluate how biotic interactions-primarily conspecific density dependence-and spatially variable abiotic conditions jointly influence seedling regeneration across different height classes. Our results show that seedling survival was primarily driven by initial seedling height and environmental variation, while responses to density dependence were comparatively weak. Canopy structural variables, such as canopy gap fraction and mean leaf inclination angle (MLA), emerged as key predictors of regeneration success, reflecting the influence of forest structure on the potential light environment. The influence of environmental factors on density dependence varied in both strength and direction: Conspecific density dependence shifted from negative to positive with increasing canopy openness and slope but reversed from positive to negative with improved soil quality. Furthermore, as seedling height increased, the relative importance of initial seedling height for survival diminished, while environmental factors and biotic interactions became more prominent. Overall, our study highlights that seedling height and forest structural heterogeneity are the most significant factors driving seedling regeneration in Qinghai spruce forests, with environmental factors and biotic interactions playing increasingly important roles as seedlings grow. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying seedling survival and inform the conservation and management of spruce forests.

AB This study is based on the theory of social embedding and selects the entrance community of Baoping County in the Giant Panda National Park as a case to explore the five core dimensions of cognitive embedding, relational embedding, structural embedding, institutional embedding, and cultural embedding and their mechanisms of influence on pro-environmental behaviors (mainly the five dimensions discussed). The study constructs a "stimulus-organism-response" (S-O-R) model, introduces two mediating variables, tourism impact perception and place attachment, and conducts empirical analysis based on 326 valid questionnaire responses using structural equation modeling. The results show that all dimensions of social embedding have a significant positive impact on pro-environmental behaviors, but the mechanisms and transmission paths vary. Each dimension indirectly influences pro-environmental behaviors through the chain path of "tourism impact perception -> place attachment." The study reveals the key role of social relationship networks, tourism perception, and emotional belonging in stimulating environmental behaviors and emphasizes the need to systemically enhance residents' ecological responsibility awareness and action willingness through community co-construction, optimization of tourism benefits, and cultural atmosphere creation.

AB Solar-powered water-thermoelectric cogeneration technology, with its eco-friendly sustainability and high energy efficiency, provides a novel solution to address water scarcity and energy challenges. However, the synergistic optimization of material performance and cost-effectiveness remains a critical challenge. Herein, in this study, zinc ion (Zn2+)-crosslinked carboxylated single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs-COOH) intercalated porous graphene oxide (PGO) membrane (PGO-Zn-CNT) is successfully fabricated by using a cost-effective and eco-friendly static deposition method. By chemically etching GO nanosheets to construct a micro and nanoporous structure and intercalating SWCNTs-COOH between GO layers, the photothermal conversion and evaporation performance are simultaneously optimized. In order to trade off evaporation performance and economy, the PGO-Zn-CNT membrane is perforated macroscopically in the center to enhance the heat convection and thermal mass transfer processes. The PGO-Zn-CNT-1.5 membrane achieves an evaporation rate of 1.75 kg m-2 h-1 and a conversion efficiency of 92.12 % under 1 sun irradiation. Moreover, the membrane exhibits excellent removal capabilities for typical pollutants such as organic dyes, heavy metal ions, and antibiotics. The research also leads to the innovative construction of a thermoelectric cogeneration system (TCS), which can generate 125.0 mV under 1 light condition and realize the energy utilization of waste heat. The system achieves 8.6 L m-2 day-1 of freshwater with a stable 107.4 mV output in an outdoor test. This work develops a TCS that provides a feasible solution for the realization of hydropower cogeneration in remote areas.

AB For solar hybrid systems, how to co-optimize their design and operation based on comprehensive objectives to maximize their investment benefits is an important but unresolved issue. Moreover, traditional forward-problembased method can merely conduct local optimum through single-stage solution and limited case comparison. Based on inverse problem method, a two-stage co-optimization method is developed for the design and operation of solar hybrid combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems with energy storage. Taking Qingdao airport as an example, the optimal scheme and guidance method of proposed systems are obtained to maximize the annual incremental investment return rate (IIR) through improved particle swarm algorithm. The results indicate that: (1) The combination of PV driven CCHP systems and MAX-IIR mode is the optimal solution and its annual IIR reaches 9.48. (2) Compared to solar schemes obtained through traditional optimization methods, this scheme can generate economic benefits of up to 17.4 million yuan and reduce cost differences by up to 15.1 million yuan. (3) MAX-IIR mode is developed and adopts a three-level control strategy for the optimal system output configurations. The research shows the advantages of inverse problem method, which provides crucial guidance for the design optimization and economic evaluation of solar hybrid systems.

AB Current research on addressing mobile phone addiction primarily focuses on mitigating the influence of psychopathological factors. In the present work, we conducted three studies to investigate a novel hypothesis that forgiveness, as a form of psychological compensation, may offer a previously underappreciated protective effect against mobile phone addiction in the aftermath of interpersonal transgressions. Study 1 (N = 391), a cross-sectional survey, established an association between negative life events and mobile phone addiction. Utilizing a recall methodology, Study 2 (N = 256) demonstrated that higher levels of forgiveness mitigated the adverse effect of interpersonal transgressions on mobile phone addiction. Moreover, forgiveness was particularly effective in reducing mobile phone addiction in cases involving mild-as opposed to severe-transgressions. Subsequently, in Study 3 (N = 175), we employed a scenario-based approach to investigate the mechanisms through which forgiveness mitigates mobile phone addiction following interpersonal transgressions. The results indicated that social bonding-specifically, reduced social distance and increased positive affect toward transgressors-mediated the relationship between forgiveness and mobile phone addiction. In future research and practice, forgiveness-based interventions may be leveraged to reduce mobile phone addiction.

TI The (sic) Shu (Mathematics): a Qin-dynasty work on bamboo and
   wooden slips from ancient China-transcription and English translation

SO ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2007, a trove of bamboo and wooden slips clandestinely smuggled out of China was sold to the Yuelu Academy of Hunan University by a Hong Kong cultural relics dealer. The following year, another small number of slips that later proved to belong to the same group were also donated to the Academy. These slips are believed to date from no later than 212 bce. Among the documents conveyed to the Yuelu Academy is a mathematical text, the (sic) Shu (Mathematics), a character that appears on the verso of slip 01(0956) and generally regarded as the title of this work. The problems in the Shu can be divided into eleven distinctive types, namely: areas, fractions, military encampments, norms, grain conversions, proportional distributions, shao-guang ([method for] slightly [increasing] widths), volumes, excess and deficiency, right triangles (gou-gu), and taxation. The original collators of the Shu published photographs of a majority of the Shu slips along with transcriptions and notes concerning their contents in 2011; the rest appeared in 2022. In the course of the research presented here, each character on the Shu slips has been individually examined, special scribal marks have been identified, and their functions are explained. Also, each Chinese sentence has been carefully punctuated, resulting in a more readable version of the Chinese text. In what follows, the Shu is translated into English for the first time, with corresponding notes to help readers better understand the context of the Shu as well as many of the paleographic, philological, and various technical details necessary for a correct understanding of the translation. This work serves as a window into the evolution and development of Chinese mathematics during the pre-Qin and Qin periods, and thereby reflects the state of ancient Chinese mathematics at that time.

AB Introduction Climate change has profoundly reshaped the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of plants. A. victorialis, a wild vegetable with significant edible and medicinal value, is highly favored by residents in the upper reaches of the Dadu River - Minjiang River, leading to its extensive collection and utilization.Methods This study simulated the potential distribution of A. victorialis in the upper reaches of the Dadu River-Minjiang River using an ensemble model, predicting the impacts of future climate change on its distribution, the migration patterns of the centroid of suitable habitats, and its ecological niche. Additionally, a production dynamic model integrating ecological suitability and nutritional components of A. victorialis was constructed to delineate its current and future potential cultivation areas.Results and discussion The results demonstrated that the annual temperature range, precipitation in the warmest quarter, and temperature seasonality coefficient are the main factors restricting the potential distribution of A. victorialis Multivariate environmental similarity and the most dissimilar variable analysis revealed significant climate anomalies in the study area, indicating that future climate change will have a substantial impact on A. victorialis. In the current period, the suitable habitats and high-yield cultivation areas of A. victorialis are concentrated in low-altitude river valleys in the upper reaches of the Dadu River - Minjiang River. Under future scenarios, highly suitable habitats and first-class cultivation areas will face shrinkage, with the ecological niche and distribution centroid migrating northeastward. By 2090, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the changes will be most drastic: first-class cultivation areas will disappear entirely, and highly suitable habitats will be nearly lost. This study will facilitate the development of suitable management strategies for A. victorialis in the upper reaches of the Dadu River-Minjiang River, providing a scientific reference for the sustainable utilization of mountain plant resources under climate change.

AB Porcine diarrheal disease is a major cause of morbidity in Tibetan piglets, however, the causative agents of this disease are rarely reported. Here, the viral diversity associated with porcine diarrheal disease was investigated by analyzing the viral communities from Tibetan pigs on the Tibetan plateau of southwest China. The results revealed that 13 mammalian viruses were identified in a pooled sample. Interestingly, it is the first time that dicistrovirus (DCV) was discovered in pigs and St-Valerien-like virus (StVV) was identified in China. Furthermore, the complete genome sequence of the two strains (DCV/porcine/CHN/SCdc-2024 and StVV/porcine/CHN/SCdc-202402) were obtained. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that the swine-origin DCV/porcine/CHN/SCdc-2024 strain was classified into the family Dicistroviridae with an unassigned genus, and showed distant relationship with other dicistrovirus strains in established genera, may represent members of a potential new genera within the Dicistroviridae family. Additionally, the novel StVV strain StVV/porcine/CHN/SCdc-202402 was classified into the Valovirus, whereas showed a unique phylogenetic branch compared with other swine-origin StVV strains. Notably, further case-control investigation in the 87 fecal samples using specific RT-PCR found a high DCV-positive detection rate (77.8%) in diarrheic samples with a significant p value (< 0.0001), suggesting the DCV might associated with diarrhea in pigs. Our study reports for the first time the emergence of DCV in pigs and StVV in China, highlighting the need for further research on pathogenicity and transmission in swine hosts.

AB This cross-sectional study investigated the association between the frequency of COVID-19 infections and mental health outcomes among Chinese residents as well as the moderating roles of residence, living alone, sex, and age. A total of 30,053 residents aged 19 to 107 years (M = 44.11, SD = 16.55), including 15,011 males (49.9%), participated in this study between June 20 and August 21, 2023. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and psychological resilience were measured via self-reported questionnaires. The results indicated that residents who had been infected with COVID-19 only once reported lower levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress and higher levels of psychological resilience than did residents who had never been infected and those who had been infected multiple times. However, residents who had been infected multiple times reported worse mental health outcomes. Individuals who lived alone, men, and older participants were more strongly affected by multiple infections. The timing of the lifting of quarantine measures, gender roles, and social connections may explain the results of this study. Public policies addressing mental health should fully consider residents' sociocultural backgrounds and demographic characteristics.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ChiCTR2300072573

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance In 2023, the classic work of Tibetan medicine, the Four Medical Tantras, was successfully inscribed on the Memory of the World Register. The Astanga Hrdaya Samhita was also introduced to Tibet in the 10th century A.D. and translated into Tibetan. Although many scholars at home and abroad have shown interest in the historical exchange between the two texts, no quantitative and objective comparative research results have yet been published.Aim of the study This study aims to reveal and compare the use of diets, medicinal materials and preparations as therapeutic means in the Four Medical Tantras and the Astanga Hrdaya Samhita , and to explore their historical exchanges between these two traditional medical system.Materials and methods (1) Data mining: Relevant information on diets, medicinal materials, and preparations was extracted from the Four Medical Tantras and the Astanga Hrdaya Samhita , and entered into a Microsoft Excel 2010 table to establish the datasets, respectively. (2) Statistical analysis: IBM SPSS statistics 27.0, SPSS Modeler 18.0 and Gephi 0.9.2 were used to analyze the contents of diets, medicinal materials, and preparations, such as frequency, association rules, and complex networks. (3) Comparative study: The Mann-Whitney test, a non-parametric method, and the intuitive comparison method were used to analyze the similarities and differences in terms of therapeutic means of diets, medicinal materials, and preparations documented in the Four Medical Tantras and the Astanga Hrdaya Samhita .Results (1) Foods: The Four Medical Tantras document 153 kinds, categorized into five major types, mainly meat. The Astanga Hrdaya Samhita documents 392 types, categorized into six major types, mainly vegetables. There are 49 shared food types between the two texts. (2) Drinks: The Four Medical Tantras document 65 kinds, categorized into three major types. The Astanga Hrdaya Samhita documents 81 kinds, categorized into five major types (including more sugar cane- and sesame oil-based types), and includes South Asian specialty drinks such as yellow cow urine, camel urine, and elephant urine. Among them, 18 drink types are shared. (3) Medicinal materials: The Four Medical Tantras document 1,115 species, mainly animal-based medicines, with 388 recorded efficacies classified into 17 disease types. The Astanga Hrdaya Samhita documents 762 species, mainly plant-based, with 40 recorded efficacies classified into 30 disease types. Among them, 227 medicinal materials are shared, with 21 overlapping recorded efficacies. (4) Preparations: The Four Medical Tantras document 2,678 types, with combinations following the principle of "coolness in warmth, and warmth in coolness," reflecting Tibetan medical characteristics. The Astanga Hrdaya Samhita documents 2,240 types, commonly using pepper, ghee, and honey, embodying Ayurveda's principle of "combining food and medicine" and reflecting its characteristics approach to medication.Conclusion This study found both differences and commonalities in their therapeutic content. The both texts differ markedly in the total amount and classification of therapeutic content, with particularly striking differences in dietary types and sources of medicinal materials, reflecting the different ecological and cultural characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau and South Asia. At the same time, there is a partial overlap between the both texts, such as 9.9% of foods, 14.1% of drinks, and 13.8% of medicinal materials are shared, with a 48% similarity in their recorded efficacies.
   These findings provide an empirical basis for understanding the similarities and differences between Tibetan medicine and the Ayurvedic medical system, and open new perspectives for comparative studies of traditional medicine.

AB The evaluation of genetic diversity in germplasm resources is fundamental to crop breeding. A total of 183 oat germplasm resources were evaluated through field trials at Xinjin District and Shandan County, located in southern and northern China, respectively. Phenotypic and agronomic traits were assessed, including six qualitative and sixteen quantitative characteristics. Results revealed significant variation in panicle attitude and grain color, based on the statistical analysis using SPSS. Among the sixteen quantitative traits, coefficient of variation ranged from 4.92% to 48.02% with the second internode thickness exhibiting the highest genetic diversity index. Correlation analysis of sixteen quantitative traits was performed using R Studio, and the results indicated significant positive relationships between grain weight and several ear characteristics, including spikelet number, ear length, layer numbers, and grain numbers per ear. Principal component analysis categorized the sixteen quantitative phenotypic traits into five independent factors. The structural equation modeling using SPSS-AMOS indicated that ear characteristics showed strong direct contributions to grain weight, establishing it as a key indicator for future breeding efforts. The multiple correspondence analysis by R Studio suggested that a total of nineteen oat germplasm resources showed the grain and biomass production potential across both experimental regions.

LA English
DT Article
ID PHILOSOPHY
AB This study addresses a critical gap in Daoist scholarship by revisiting the concept of "nurturing life" ((sic)(sic)) in Zhuangzi: Essence of Nurturing Life, an idea often reduced to either medical pragmatism or mystical abstraction in contemporary interpretations. In light of rising global interest in holistic wellness, psychological resilience, and existential balance, this paper argues that Zhuangzi offers a philosophically rigorous and spiritually embodied model of life cultivation, distinct from both Confucian moralism and biomedical reductionism. Using hermeneutic textual analysis grounded in Daoist metaphysics, the study examines central parables, including Cook Ding, the marsh pheasant, and the Right Master, to uncover how Zhuangzi integrates physical finitude with intuitive freedom. The analysis also traces the philological evolution of (sic)(sic) across classical texts, such as Shuowen Jiezi, Zuo Zhuan, Mencius, and the Dao De Jing, revealing how Zhuangzi reconfigures the term from a ritual or ethical duty toward an existential alignment with the Dao. Rather than presenting nurturing life as a strategy for longevity, Zhuangzi frames it as a dynamic interplay between moderation, spontaneity, and self-acceptance. His view emphasizes attunement over control, serenity over striving, and resonance with natural rhythms over rigid prescriptions. This vision is further contextualized through comparative reference to Indian Purushartha and contemporary philosophies of flourishing. The findings position Zhuangzi not merely as a voice from antiquity, but as a relevant interlocutor in current discourses on health, meaning, and the art of living.

AB The conversion of large molecular weight (MW) milk into small Mw fermented milk is a complex and dynamic process that depends mainly on the selected fermenter. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of co-fermentation of Clostridium butyricum (CB) with traditional fermenters-Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (Y)-in improving the quality characteristics of fermented milk. The results showed that compared with the Y group only, the CB-complexed Y group (3CB-Y) with the appropriate addition amount (3 x 108 CFU/g) significantly increased the acidification capacity (pH = 3.9; oT = 109.5) and the number of live bacteria of the fermented milks (CB content = 2.37 x 108 CFU/g), and led to an increase in the water uptake by 15.6 % at the 28th d compared with the fermented milks of Y group, and a denser structure of the gel network of the fermented milks with an increase in the hardness (3.1 N), consistency (37.9 N s), Cohesion (-1.6 N), Viscosity index (11.7 N s) and ultimately improved the volatile flavour substances (86 species) and sensory qualities of the fermented milk. This study demonstrated that CB combined with Y co-culture could significantly improve the quality characteristics of fermented milk by altering the species and content of the bacilli, and the microstructure of the fermented milk.

AB Introduction: Curcumae Rhizoma (Ezhu) and Curcumae Radix (Yujin) are both derived from Curcuma kwangsiensis (CK), an important species in the Zingiberaceae family. They have different clinical applications in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): The rhizome is mainly used for antitumor treatments, whereas the radix is known for antidepressant and cholagogic effects, both officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. However, non-medicinal parts such as the aerial portions and fibrous roots are sometimes mixed in, leading to confusion in clinical formulation use. Objective: This study aimed to analyze different parts of CK, including its rhizome (RHCK), radix (RACK), aerial parts (APCK), and fibrous root (FRCK) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-electrostatic field Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methodology: These mineral elements of different parts in CK were determined by using (ICP-MS). The nonvolatile metabolites were achieved by UPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS, and the volatile metabolites were identified by GC-MS. Statistical analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) model, was used to classify different parts of CK based on mineral elements and metabolites. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized to effectively differentiate the different parts by analyzing the data. Results: In total, 26 mineral elements, 738 nonvolatile metabolites, and 87 volatile metabolites were identified. Multivariate analysis revealed 14 mineral elements, 390 nonvolatile metabolites, and 42 volatile metabolites (VIP > 1) as potential markers. A LDA model effectively distinguished the four plant parts, achieving a classification accuracy of 95%. Conclusion: These findings offer a practical strategy for accurately identifying and differentiating medicinal from non-medicinal parts of CK, reducing misidentification in TCM formulations and enhancing clinical safety.

AB This paper addresses the finite-time stability (FTS) problem of second-order neural networks (SNNs) with time-varying discrete and distributed delays (mixed delays) in the presence of unknown time-varying actuator faults. First, an exponential type state-feedback fault-tolerant controller is designed. Second, by utilizing Lyapunov functional method in combination with several inequalities, some sufficient conditions are established to ensure the FTS for the concerned SNNs. Unlike previous studies, our approach directly analyzes second-order delayed differential equations, removing the need for the reduced-order method and the assumption of bounded activation functions. Furthermore, another controller with simpler form is proposed, which also achieves the FTS of the studied system. Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results.

AB Due to increasing demand for the exploration of marine resources, underwater optical wireless sensor networks (UOWSNs) have emerged as a promising solution by offering higher bandwidth and lower latency compared to traditional underwater acoustic wireless sensor networks (UAWSNs), with their existing routing protocols facing challenges in energy consumption and packet forwarding. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an energy-partitioned routing protocol based on an advancement function (EPAR) for UOWSNs. By dynamically classifying the nodes into high-energy and low-energy ones, the proposed EPAR algorithm employs an adaptive weighting strategy to prioritize the high-energy nodes in relay selection, thereby balancing network load and extending overall lifetime. In addition, a tunable advancement function is adopted by the proposed EPAR algorithm by comprehensively considering the Euclidean distance and steering angle toward the sink node. By adjusting a tunable parameter alpha, the function guides forwarding decisions to ensure energy-efficient and directionally optimal routing. Additionally, by employing a hop-by-hop neighbor discovery mechanism, the proposed algorithm enables each node to dynamically update its local neighbor set, thereby improving relay selection and mitigating the impact of void regions on the packet delivery ratio (PDR). Simulation results demonstrate that EPAR can obtain up to about a 10% improvement in PDR and up to about a 30% reduction in energy depletion, with a prolonged network lifetime when compared to the typical algorithms adopted in the simulations.

AB Dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) has attracted much attention in multi-criteria decision-making problems for data with preference-ordered relations since its inception. However, in the real world, there is often the challenge of incomplete information. This paper addresses approaches to attribute reduction in an incomplete ordered decision system (IODS). Attribute evaluation is crucial in the attribute reduction process. Traditional evaluation functions primarily depend on the relationships between features, neglecting their impact on classification, and incur high computational costs when calculating lower and upper approximations. To address these issues, this paper proposes whole inter-class non-dominance as the criterion for attribute importance. First, we define the concepts of inter-class proximity and inter-class non-dominance in an IODS, with whole inter-class non-dominance serving as the evaluation index for attribute importance. Next, we propose a method for calculating inter-class non-dominance based on the expanded dominance matrix. Finally, combined with the heuristic search strategy, an attribute reduction algorithm based on inter-class non-dominance (HANDR) was designed, and experiments on various datasets from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves running time and classification accuracy.

AB Folic acid, an essential micronutrient in male reproductive physiology, serves as a critical cofactor in one-carbon metabolism by facilitating nucleotide biosynthesis and epigenetic methylation processes fundamental to spermatogenesis. Its metabolic role is characterized by two pivotal biochemical transformations: the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine and the subsequent generation of S-adenosylmethionine. These reactions collectively sustain nucleic acid synthesis, preserve genomic integrity, and modulate transcriptional regulation in developing germ cells. Compromised folate status disrupts small nuclear RNA (snRNA) maturation and methylation patterns, resulting in impaired spliceosome complex formation and compromised pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing accuracy. Such molecular perturbations generate defective transcripts that ultimately undermine proteomic homeostasis during spermiogenesis. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that folate deficiency induces chromosomal segregation errors, mitotic spindle checkpoint dysfunction, and concurrent oxidative/endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways-all converging to manifest as teratozoospermia, diminished motility, and elevated sperm DNA fragmentation indices. Folic acid supplementation can improve snRNA and spliceosomal function, leading to improve semen parameters, particularly in individuals with polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes such as MTHFR. However, treatment efficacy exhibits dose-dependence, temporal dynamics, pharmacogenetic variation, and synergistic interactions with concurrent micronutrient administration, underscoring the imperative for personalized nutritional approaches. Emerging single-nucleus RNA sequencing technologies have elucidated intricate regulatory circuitry connecting folate-responsive snRNAs with mRNA processing, miRNA-mediated silencing, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-mediated chromatin remodeling. These findings propose candidate molecular signatures for monitoring therapeutic response. Notwithstanding these advances, the mechanistic interplay between folate metabolism and snRNA processing machinery remains incompletely characterized, and evidence-based clinical protocols for infertility management remain undefined. Future research directions should encompass: (1) multi-omics integration (epigenomic-transcriptomic-proteomic); (2) pharmacogenomic-guided intervention trials; and (3) dynamic splicing efficiency quantification platforms. Such approaches will enable precision therapeutic stratification to maximize clinical outcomes while mitigating potential adverse effects. This critical synthesis delineates the mechanistic nexus between folate-dependent snRNA regulation, RNA splicing fidelity, and spermatogenic competence, while advocating for biomarker-driven, genotype-tailored therapeutic paradigms in folate-responsive male infertility.

AB Sleep staging is used to assess sleep quality and diagnose sleep-related disorders by monitoring and analyzing physiological signals during sleep. Although previous studies have demonstrated notable success in sleep staging, most current methods rely predominantly on single-modality or single-channel data. To achieve high accuracy in automatic sleep staging, this study proposes a multimodal approach that leverages different modality features in the time and frequency domains of multichannel signals. A parallel network combined with cross-attention mechanism was designed to facilitate the effective integration of multimodal features. The cross-attention mechanism captures the complex relationships between the time domain and frequency domain, thereby improving the performance of the parallel network. The CrossFusionSleepNet achieved accuracies of 89.0%, 87.5%, and 88.9%, with corresponding F1-scores of 84.0%, 83.0%, and 81.8% on multiple public sleep stage datasets (SleepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS). Our results demonstrate that the multimodal approach shows potential advantages over single-modality methods, offering a novel perspective for accurate automatic sleep staging.

AB Immovable cultural relics (ICRs) are important resources for constructing regional cultural memory and identity. With the guidance of regional historical geography, this study reveals the spatiotemporal distribution of ICRs in the Sichuan-Chongqing area and the relationships between ICRs and various geographic elements. (1) ICRs tend toward the central and eastern regions, and ancient architecture is the most common, followed by modern historical sites and representative buildings. (2) ICR has shown an increasing trend from Prehistory to the present and reached its peak in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. As time progresses, the ICRs tend toward local aggregations. (3) ICRs exhibit a low-altitude tendency, temperature adaptability, and hydrophilicity. Multiple human geographical factors shape the rich cultural connotations and value of ICR. This study provides an empirical reference for the adaptive reuse of ICR, and it is an important attempt at distinguishing between regional historical geography and cultural heritage.

AB Emergency shelter standards developed for densely populated urban areas with robust infrastructure are often inadequate for rural regions with sparse populations, limited facilities, and constrained rescue access-such as the high-altitude villages of western Sichuan, China. This study investigates representative ethnic settlements in this region through field surveys and large-scale experimental assessments to reveal the mismatch between current shelter standards and the realities of high-altitude evacuation scenarios. Based on this, the study evaluates capacity requirements and land expansion needs for emergency shelters and proposes context-specific design strategies. Furthermore, CFD-based thermal simulations are conducted to optimize the heating frequency of traditional indoor heating devices used in temporary shelters, offering practical guidance for thermal regulation. Preliminary findings indicate that the demand for expanded space is primarily driven by increased body length when lying down and the local need to store culturally significant personal items, such as stoves and prayer wheels. The revised spatial benchmark suggests a similar to 20 % increase in per capita shelter area. By integrating considerations of harsh climatic conditions and indigenous cultural practices, this research proposes a localized framework for emergency shelter design in high-altitude rural environments. The findings contribute to improving spatial planning for post-disaster response and enhancing the resilience of underserved mountainous communities.

AB Specialized herbivores like giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), red pandas (Ailurus fulgens), and bamboo rats, which primarily consume bamboo, are at risk of nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 (VB12), potentially leading to cardiovascular diseases. This study explored the effects of VB12 supplementation on cardiovascular health in silver star bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus). We first conducted a comprehensive genome annotation of R. pruinosus, laying the foundation for in-depth evolutionary studies. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes related to cardiovascular disease (e.g., Sgcb, Adcy2, Itga1, Itgb8, Ifng, and Gpc1) were upregulated in the livers of R. pruinosus compared to carnivorous and omnivorous rodents, indicating a higher cardiovascular disease risk. After 60 days of VB12 supplementation, liver transcriptome analysis revealed significant improvements in cardiovascular health markers, including reduced cholesterol synthesis and enhanced fatty acid metabolism. Serum biochemical assays indicated that VB12 supplementation led to reduced homocysteine levels, decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-to-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratios, and increased the apolipoprotein A-to-apolipoprotein B ratio. These findings suggest that VB12 may mitigate cardiovascular disease risk and could be considered in the dietary management of specialized bamboo-eating species. Our study provides valuable insights into disease prevention strategies for these species with similar dietary habits.

AB Liquid metals are highly desirable in various applications such as electronic skin, soft sensors, and flexible electrodes due to their ultrahigh conductivity and exceptional fluidity. However, their practical utility is hindered by challenges related to the high surface tension and susceptibility to oxidation, leading to poor wettability on hydrophilic substrates. In this study, we present an approach to significantly improve the surface wettability of liquid metals on hydrogels, facilitated by poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Through strong polymer chain entanglements, PEDOT:PSS is capable of adsorbing onto the surface of prestretched hydrogels, thereby providing a robust infiltration substrate for liquid metals. Even when immersed in an aqueous solution with a pH of 4-7, liquid metals can be firmly adhered to the PEDOT:PSS surface for up to 30 days. The remarkable infiltration capability of PEDOT:PSS, combined with liquid metals, enables the formation of continuous and stable conductive pathways on the hydrogel surfaces. The resulting conductive hydrogels exhibit different sensitivity factors in three different stretch ratio ranges for various applications in soft electronic systems. This PEDOT:PSS-assisted approach holds promise for applications in soft circuits, sensors, and flexible electronics, thus offering significant potential for wearable sensor technologies.

AB Using viral metagenomics, we identified a novel torovirus, GToV/SWUN/SC, in diarrheal goat fecal samples with a genome length of 28,457 nt. This strain shares 96.73-96.79% nucleotide identity with Antelope torovirus (AToV) but only 88.43% with the GToV/SZ strain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship between GToV/SWUN/SC and AToV. Structural analysis showed three distinct structural variations in the HE protein and multiple amino acid mutations in the S gene, which may influence host adaptation. RT-PCR detected a 35.9% (240/669) positivity rate, indicating widespread circulation of GToV in Sichuan, Chongqing, and Yunnan. This study enhances the understanding of torovirus epidemiology and evolution, providing a theoretical basis for further research on viral diversity.

AB This study develops a high-performance water-based mold release agent for polyurethane (PU) foaming applications. We demonstrate that incorporating octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) into a dimethyl silicone oil emulsion (5 vol% fixed concentration) significantly enhances key performance metrics. By systematically varying D4 content (0-15 vol%), we characterize droplet morphology, particle size distribution, contact angle, and viscosity to elucidate the underlying enhancement mechanism. Our findings reveal the following: (i) Optimal emulsion stability: At 5 vol% D4, the mold release agent exhibits a narrow particle size distribution (6-9 mu m). (ii) Efficient processing: Film formation completes within 10 min, reducing demolding force and yielding PU foam with defect-free, non-adherent surfaces. (iii) Storage stability: After 60 days in ambient conditions, performance remains unchanged, with no phase separation observed under thermal stress (60 degrees C) or refrigeration (2-6 degrees C). This work explores an alternative pathway to mitigate key limitations-slow film formation and poor shelf-life-offering a prototype for next-generation release agents.

AB Oviduct epithelial cells (OECs) constitute a critical component of the oviductal mucosa, providing essential microenvironmental support for fertilization and early embryonic development. Their frequent application in embryo co-culture systems is constrained in yaks (Bos grunniens) by limited tissue availability and the short lifespan of primary yak oviduct epithelial cells (YOECs). To address this limitation, we established immortalized YOEC lines using a lentiviral vector system. Primary YOECs isolated from reproductive tract tissues of adult female yaks via enzymatic digestion were immortalized through individual and combined transfection with simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The resulting immortalized lines (YOECs-S: SV40LT alone; YOECs-HS: dual SV40LT/hTERT) kept their typical cobblestone shape and still made cytokeratin 18. Both lines exhibited stable SV40LT and hTERT expression (p > 50), maintained diploid karyotypes, and demonstrated serum-dependent growth, contact inhibition, and hormone responsiveness. Notably, YOECs-HS displayed superior proliferative capacity and phenotypic stability during long-term culture. This study reports the first successful establishment and comprehensive characterization of immortalized YOEC lines. These validated models provide a valuable experimental platform for optimizing yak embryo-oviduct epithelial cell co-culture systems and advancing reproductive research in this high-altitude-adapted species.

AB Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Macrococcus caseolyticus isolated from Chinese bacon on the quality of Chinese-style sausages. Methods: The physicochemical properties and volatile flavor compounds (VOCs) of sausages inoculated with M. caseolyticus at different concentrations (105, 106, and 107 CFU/g) were investigated. VOCs were detected using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Results: The sausages inoculated with M. caseolyticus showed progressive decreases in Aw, total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), malondialdehyde and carbonyl content during fermentation compared to the control sausage. A total of 90 VOCs were identified based on GC-IMS analysis, including 20 esters, 17 aldehydes, 22 alcohols, 12 ketones, 5 acids compounds, and 14 other compounds. M. caseolyticus-inoculated sausages exhibited elevated levels in alcohols and aldehydes, while the content of ketones was reduced compared to the control sausage. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated the significant differences in volatile flavor profiles among the sample and control sausages. Notably, seven VOCs in sausages, including 1-octen-3-ol, isoamyl alcohol, heptanal, hexanal, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, ethyl isovalerate and 2-pinene, were identified as the key aroma compounds (ROAV >= 1).

TI Metabolomic Analysis of Feces vs. Cecum Content in Animals: A
   Comparative Study Investigated by 1H-NMR
SO METABOLITES

DT Article

ID CHAIN FATTY-ACIDS; GUT MICROBIOTA; MICE
AB Background: Feces and cecum content are commonly involved in metabolomic analysis to understand the gut metabolic profile of the host, while, in fact, they are different. Feces represent the terminal excretory product after extensive host enzymatic digestion, absorption, and significant modification by the distal gut microbiota. In contrast, cecum content reflects the localized, in situ metabolic microenvironment at that specific site. However, it is worth noting that feces are the most accessible sample type for non-invasive studies, which could be considered proxies for cecum content in some specific cases. Unfortunately, the validity of fecal samples as an alternative to cecum content has rarely been assessed. Methods: The current study attempted to illustrate the distinct metabolomic and microbiota features of feces and cecum content in eight animals (mouse, pig, chicken, duck, rabbit, Gansu yak, Sichuan yak, and sheep) by means of H-1-NMR and 16S rRNA, respectively. Results: A total of 116 molecules were characterized in feces and cecum content samples. Among them, 22 molecules were shared in all groups. Taking advantage of the univariate analysis, twenty-seven of the quantified molecules were significantly different between feces and cecum content, mainly pertaining to amino acids and organic acids. Moreover, in terms of mammals and non-mammals, short-chain fatty acids could be considered the main factor discriminating the metabolomic profiles between feces and cecum content. Furthermore, to better understand the mechanism of their metabolomic differences, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis was performed on feces and cecum content samples of mice, which is the most widely used animal model. The result showed that the Ace, Shannon, and Sobs indexes in feces were significantly higher than those of cecum content (p < 0.05). At the phylum and genus levels, the microbiota structures of feces and cecum content were similar, while the relative abundances of their microbiota exhibited distinct features. Conclusions: The present study could reduce this gap in information by characterizing, for the first time, the metabolomic differences between feces and cecum content using H-1-NMR. Moreover, this study is meant as a reference guide for researchers wishing to apply a metabolomics approach to the gut of the host.

AB Enhancing intramuscular fat (IMF) to improve the quality of livestock product has long been a goal in animal breeding. Recent studies have revealed a strong connection between malonylation and lipid metabolism, yet the function of malonylated proteins in ruminants largely unclear. In the present study, we identified the third day of goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation as a critical time point for lipid accumulation, with no significant alterations in malonylation levels. We identified 212 and 216 malonylated proteins on day 0 (d0) and day 3 (d3) of differentiation, respectively, enrichment in pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tight junctions, and actin cytoskeleton regulation. Our findings demonstrate the consistent presence of malonylation during preadipocyte differentiation, with minor quantitative variations, and highlight key malonylated proteins closely associated with lipid metabolism, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA), translation control tumor protein 1 (TPT1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), annexin A6 (ANXA6), and annexin A2 (ANXA2). Collectively, our study uncovers critical malonylated proteins during preadipocyte differentiation, establishing a foundation for exploring their roles in intramuscular fat deposition. Significance: Currently, efforts are being made to improve meat quality by enhancing intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition, thereby promoting the development of the livestock industry. This study addresses a critical gap in our understanding of malonylation, a key post-translational modification, in livestock. By constructing the first malonylation protein modification map in goats and revealing dynamic changes during intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation, this research offers novel insights into the regulatory roles of malonylation in fat deposition. The findings not only advance the field of livestock proteomics but also provide a theoretical foundation for improving meat quality and exploring metabolic regulation in animals.

AB An electrochemical sensor demonstrating exceptional sensitivity was constructed for bisphenol F analysis. Carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanocubes were synthesized and then applied to modify a glassy carbon electrode layer by layer, creating the unique sensing platform. The combination of carbon nanocages and Prussian blue nanocubes greatly improved the charge transfer rate and offered a substantial surface area for bisphenol F adsorption. Exhibiting outstanding electrocatalytic performance for bisphenol F oxidation, the as-proposed electrode provided a broad linear range from 0.1 to 500 mu M and a low detection limit of 0.03 mu M (S/N = 3). The sensor manifested strong selectivity, showing minimal interference from typical coexisting substances. Its stability and reproducibility were evaluated, and the results were satisfactory. The sensor effectively determined bisphenol F in real samples, achieving recoveries between 95.7 % and 98.4 %. This study offers a promising method for the sensitive and precise detection of bisphenol F in environmental samples, significantly contributing to environmental monitoring.

AB The MFGM proteins are crucial for neonatal growth, immune regulation, and metabolic balance throughout mammalian life cycle. However, the composition and remain poorly understood. This study applied Astraldata-independent acquisition proteomics to profile yak MFGM proteins, identifying 5,590 proteins. Specifically, 2,310 MFGM proteins were significantly differentially expressed between MC and MM, 2,351 between MC and MT, and 846 between MT and MM. In MC, proteins involved in immune modulation, antioxidants, and cell protection were highly expressed. As lactation progressed, lipid metabolism proteins increased, particularly in MT, which demonstrated activation of metabolic pathways related to triglyceride synthesis and fatty acid desaturation. Our findings reveal that MFGM proteins support passive immunity in MC, activate metabolism in MT, and ensure sustained nutrient delivery in MM. These insights are valuable for developing yak milk-based dairy products.

AB This article considers a class of nonlinear spatial fractional backward diffusion problems. Implicit integration factor (IIF) format is a highly competitive approach for solving nonlinear diffusion systems, which has considerable stability and robustness. Therefore, we extend it to solve the nonlinear backward diffusion system, which is called the backward implicit integration factor (BIIF) method. The stability and error analysis of BIIF are introduced. In order to improve the computational efficiency of implementing BIIF, we propose the ARA-BG fast solving algorithm, which combines the adaptive restarting shift-invert Arnoldi (ARA) algorithm and the BiCGSTAB (BG) algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the BIIF method can achieve more stable and ideal accuracy compared to the Crank-Nicolson method, and also verify that the proposed ARA-BG algorithm is the most competitive among all tested algorithms in terms of CPU.

AB Based on a theoretical analysis, this study examines the impact of climate finance on employment and its mechanism based on calculated climate finance indices of Chinese cities and provinces from 2008 to 2023, combined with samples of A-share listed enterprises in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The results show that climate finance plays a positive role in promoting the employment level of enterprises. With the improvement in the climate finance level in the city where enterprises are located, the employment level of enterprises increases. Second, climate finance reduces the capital-labor ratio of enterprises by encouraging them to carry out R&D activities, digital transformation, and risk hedging. This reduces the capital-labor ratio and improves the employment level of enterprises. Third, climate finance can reduce the agency cost between shareholders and managers by reducing the difficulty of supervision by shareholders, alleviates information asymmetry, and curbs managerial opportunistic behavior. This lowers agency costs between shareholders and managers, thereby improving the employment level of enterprises.

TI Surface-modified polyimide on novel porous ceramic membranes for
   pervaporation desalination
SO RSC ADVANCES

ID WATER
AB Although pervaporation (PV) desalination is a promising solution to global freshwater scarcity, membranes suffer from unstable separation performance. This study utilized resource recycling to prepare a porous ceramic membrane using solid waste fly ash as raw material, which was then combined with polyimide (PI) to produce a high-performance composite membrane (abbreviated to as PI/ceramic membrane). In this composite membrane, the ceramic membrane provides mechanical support and promotes rapid water passage, while the PI layer intercepts hydrated salt ions through size screening and electronic repulsion. Through their synergistic action, the composite membrane can preferentially adsorb and diffuse water molecules while retaining. Results indicate in addition to a retention efficiency of nearly 99.9%, the PI/ceramic membranes achieved a permeability of 10.88 L (m-2 h-1), which is superior to other existing polymer-modified membranes. Simultaneously, the membrane demonstrates selective ion rejection (e.g., SO42- and Mg2+) while maintaining stable rejection performance at 90 degrees C. A 45-hour continuous operation test confirmed the composite membrane's stability, demonstrating consistent performance. This study provides a novel approach for the preparation of polymer-modified membranes for industrial wastewater desalination.

AB Six strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, isolated from fermented meat products and identified as Staphylococcus hominis 9, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 18, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 27, Staphylococcus xylosus 37, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 120, and Staphylococcus cohnii 129, were evaluated for their lipid hydrolase and antioxidant enzyme activities. The effects of the selected strains on lipid hydrolysis and oxidation in fermented sausages were subsequently investigated. In meat simulation medium, Staphylococcus cohnii 129 exhibited the highest lipase and superoxide dismutase activities among all tested strains. Therefore, S. cohnii 129 was selected as the optimal strain to ferment sausage either alone (S129) or in combination with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 77 (S129 + L77), with a blank group as the control. Lipase activities and the concentrations of lipid hydrolysis products, including monoglyceride, free glycerol, and free fatty acids, were higher in both S129 and S129 + L77 than in the control. Additionally, the suppression of lipoxygenase activity, TBARS, hexanal, and saturated aldehyde production was more pronounced in S129 and S129 + L77 compared to the control. Moreover, the highest scores for overall flavor and acceptability, and the lowest score for rancid notes, were reported for S129. The results indicate that S. cohnii 129 has significant potential for improving sausage quality and preventing the formation of off-flavors.

AB Given the detrimental effects of excessive nitrites on human health and the environment, developing rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective nitrite detection methods is critical. Herein, a CuCo2O4 spinel electrocatalyst self-supported on Fe foam (CuCo2O4/Fe foam) was synthesized through a facile electrodisplacement reaction combined with hydrothermal method and calcination. The composite featured a three-dimensional porous framework with uniformly distributed urchin-like CuCo2O4 nanostructures, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This unique architecture enhanced electrolyte penetration, exposed abundant active sites, and accelerated electron transfer, enabling superior nitrite detection performance. The sensor exhibited a wide linear range (2-1610 mu M), a low detection limit (15.7 mu M, S/N = 3), and high sensitivity (3.277 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)). Practical application in pickled vegetable samples demonstrated excellent sensitivity and anti-interference capability. After 10 days of continuous testing, the CuCo2O4/Fe foam was able to retain 87.97 % of its initial current response, demonstrating excellent electrochemical stability. This work provided a scalable and binder-free strategy for designing high-performance electrochemical sensors.

AB Multilayer films were fabricated by mimicking the structure of wheat endosperm cell walls, using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TCNFs) of varying sizes, arabinoxylan, and (3-glucan. Results indicated that longer TCNFs enhanced thermal stability and mechanical properties, increasing tensile strength from 78 to 122 MPa. Longer TCNFs formed nanoporous structures facilitating water diffusion within the film network, improving hydrophilicity and breathability. In strawberry preservation tests, these films effectively inhibited color change, decay, and respiratory activity while maintaining phenolic/ flavonoid content, extending shelf life to 12 days. The findings demonstrate that TCNF size modulates polysaccharide network structures, offering a biomimetic strategy for designing natural, high-performance food preservation films.

AB Simple Summary CIDEA, a protein associated with lipid droplets, plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Our research demonstrates that CIDEA increases the levels of lipid droplets and triglycerides while concurrently repressing cell proliferation. Furthermore, we discovered that CIDEA facilitates lipid accumulation in goat intramuscular adipocytes through the activation of the focal adhesion pathway. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular processes governing intramuscular fat deposition and provides a theoretical framework that could inform molecular breeding efforts aimed at improving the quality of goat meat.Abstract Intramuscular fat (IMF) content determines the quality of goat meat and is regulated by the comprehensive effect of the proliferation and adipogenesis of intramuscular preadipocytes. Our previous RNA-seq data revealed that cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha (DFFA)-like effector (CIDE) A was upregulated during the development of intramuscular fat in the longissimus dorsi muscle tissue, implying an important role in lipid homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which CIDEA, a member of the CIDE family, regulates intramuscular fat deposition in goat muscle is unknown, so we explored the function and underlying mechanism of CIDEA in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. To address this, we altered CIDEA in intramuscular preadipocytes and resolved the effect and mechanism of CIDEA in adipogenesis through RT-PCR, Western blot, triglyceride and LD determinations, CCK-8, and RNA-seq. It was found that CIDEA increased lipid droplets (LDs) and triglyceride contents and inhibited cell proliferation. Meanwhile, the lipid metabolism-related genes PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, SREBP1c, PLIN1, TIP47, ADFP, DGAT1, ACC, FASN, ACSL1, and FABP3 were upregulated, while the lipolysis and beta-oxidation genes HSL, ACOX1, and CPT1B, as well as the proliferation marker gene CDK1, were all downregulated upon CIDEA overexpression. Differentially expressed genes in CIDEA dysregulation groups through RNA-seq were selected and were enriched in the apelin and focal adhesion signaling pathways. Specifically, the Western blot and rescue assays found that focal adhesion, but not apelin, was the key signaling pathway in CIDEA regulating lipid deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. In summary, this study reveals that CIDEA promotes lipid deposition in intramuscular preadipocytes through the focal adhesion pathway and inhibits cell proliferation. This work clarifies the functional role and downstream signaling pathway of CIDEA in intramuscular fat deposition and provides theoretical support for improving meat quality by targeting key phenotype-related genes.

AB To investigate the impact of microencapsulation on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Zanthoxylum oil, this study compared unencapsulated Zanthoxylum oil (ZO) with microencapsulated Zanthoxylum oil (MZO) using physicochemical analysis, sensory evaluation, and molecular sensory analysis. Sensory evaluation revealed significant differences in aroma attributes between ZO and MZO, whereas no notable differences were observed in numbing intensity or overall acceptability. Colorimetric analysis indicated significant distinctions between the two samples. Electronic nose (E-nose) analysis demonstrated a reduction in overall aroma intensity for MZO compared to ZO. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 43 VOCs, including 22 compounds present in both samples, accounting for 46.8% of the total. Terpenes represented the predominant class in both ZO (69.7%) and MZO (68.2%). Comprehensive analysis based on odor activity value (OAV) and variable importance in projection (VIP) identified nine volatile compounds as key aroma contributors. Gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) detected 90 the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with esters (30.38%) and heterocyclic compounds (10.42%) predominating in ZO, while esters (29.08%) and alcohols (26.12%) were predominant in MZO. Compared to ZO, MZO exhibited increased levels of alcohols (from 12.04% to 26.12%) and terpenes (from 1.39% to 3.53%), but decreased levels of acids (from 5.77% to 2.72%) and aldehydes (from 10.29% to 4.62%). This approach provides a comprehensive assessment of flavor quality before and after microencapsulation, offers a scientific basis for quality control, and facilitates the development and utilization of Zanthoxylum oil resources.

TI Giant intrinsic electrocaloric effect in ferroelectrics by local
   structural engineering
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE SPAN; TRANSITION; TUNABILITY
AB The electrocaloric effect of ferroelectrics holds great promise for solid-state cooling, potentially replacing traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems. However, achieving adequate electrocaloric cooling capacity at room temperature remains a formidable challenge due to the need for a high intrinsic electrocaloric effect. While barium titanate ceramic exhibits a pronounced electrocaloric effect near its Curie temperature, typical chemical modifications to enhance electrocaloric properties at room temperature often reduce this intrinsic electrocaloric effect. Herein, a structural design is introduced for barium titanate-based ceramics by incorporating isovalent cations. This leads to a well-ordered local structure that decreases the Curie temperature to room temperature while preserving a sharp phase transition, enabling a large dielectric constant and tunable polarization. This design achieves a remarkable electrocaloric strength of similar to 1.0 K center dot mm/kV, surpassing previous reports. Atomic-resolution structural analyses reveal that the presence of multiscale nanodomains (from similar to 10 nm to >100 nm), and the dipole polarization distribution with gradual dipole rotation enable rapid phase transition and facile polarization rotation, accounting for the giant electrocaloric response. This work provides a strategy for achieving a strong intrinsic electrocaloric effect in ferroelectrics near room temperature and offers key insights into the microstructure landscapes driving this enhanced electrocaloric effect.

AB For a considerable period, fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) was regarded as an intracellularly secreted protein, and with a paucity of research conducted on the effects of FGF12 on cell proliferation. Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated that FGF12 can be secreted extracellularly and exhibited bioactive properties. Given the highly conserved motifs characteristic of the FGF family that are present in FGF12, we postulated that it has the potential to stimulate cell proliferation. In this study, we validated the recombinant FGF12 protein's ability to enhance fibroblast proliferation and confer anti-apoptotic properties. The subsequent analyses were conducted using differential gene expression, KEGG pathway, RT-qPCR and Western blotting, which revealed that FGF12 stimulates fibroblast proliferation via the BMP7/Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo experimentation with recombinant FGF12 protein revealed its potential to improve growth efficiency, augment blood glucose control and facilitate the development of longissimus lumborum in mice. Collectively, these findings afford novel insights into FGF12's unconventional secretion, its role in regulating cell proliferation, and its promise in promoting muscular development.

AB Mannosylated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles encapsulating Eucommia ulmoides polysaccharides (EOPP) were developed as a targeted immunomodulatory delivery system. In vitro evaluations confirmed that EOPP exhibited low cytotoxicity toward spleen lymphocytes while significantly increasing their proliferation and cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IFN-gamma). When co-delivered with ovalbumin (MN-EOPP/OVA), the system further enhanced the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-6, and IFN-gamma by immune cells and induced cytoskeletal remodeling and maturation in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Transcriptomic profiling revealed significant upregulation of immune-related genes, with KEGG and PPI analyses identifying activation of key signaling pathways, including MAPK (ERK, p38, JNK) and NF-kappa B. These pathways drive the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and dendritic cell function. Overall, MN-EOPP/OVA effectively enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses by synergistic delivery of antigen and immunopotentiator, supporting its potential as a next-generation vaccine adjuvant strategy.

TI Modulation of growth characteristics and endogenous hormone by cutting

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID AUXIN
AB Eleutherococcus giraldii (E. giraldii) is a quintessential medicinal plant in traditional Chinese medicine. This study established control, heavy pruning, and light pruning groups to reveal growth indexes and endogenous phytohormones in cultivated E. giraldii using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results indicated that light pruning significantly promoted length of new branch elongation, thereby increasing E. giraldii branch bark yield. In contrast, heavy pruning inhibited length of new branch elongation and reduced branch bark production. Both pruning intensities enhanced the number and length of newly sprouted clonal plants, facilitating population expansion of E. giraldii. The heavy pruning altered the trends of indoleacetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) in apical leaves, as well as IAA and gibberellic acid 3 (GA3) in lateral leaves. The light pruning modified the trends of IAA, ABA, and isopentenyl adenine nucleoside (iPA) in apical leaves, as well as IAA and GA3 in lateral leaves. Apical leaf IAA promoted new branch growth in E. giraldii, while lateral leaf IAA exhibited the opposite effect. iPA played a significant role in eliminating apical dominance and enhancing stress resistance in E. giraldii. GA3 inhibited new branch growth while delaying leaf senescence. Apical leaf ABA was closely associated with improved stress resistance, whereas lateral leaf ABA primarily inhibited new branch growth. This study provides valuable insights for establishing sustainable logging strategies for E. giraldii, protecting wild resources, and offers reference for research on endogenous hormone responses in shrubs under logging interventions.

AB Sustainable grassland grazing is important for the livelihood of many herders, yet few studies have examined the effect of grazing under different climatic conditions on a large scale. To fill this gap, a meta-analysis was employed using data from published studies on livestock grazing grasslands in China. China has many types of grasslands with a wide range of climatic conditions and, therefore, the results are applicable for grasslands worldwide. Different climatic areas were identified in which arid and humid grasslands were based on K & ouml;ppen-Geiger climate classifications of biomes. It emerged that the effects of grazing on plant diversity and soil organic carbon (SOC) differed between arid and humid grasslands. Light and severe grazing had negative effects while moderate grazing had no effect on the plant Shannon diversity index in arid areas. In humid areas, light and heavy grazing intensities had no effect on plant diversity, while moderate grazing increased plant species richness and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. In humid areas, light and moderate grazing did not affect SOC, while severe grazing decreased SOC. We concluded that moderate grazing could maintain and improve plant diversity in both arid and humid grasslands. (c) 2025 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Individuals with higher working memory capacities excel in mathematics performance. However, limited research has explored the impact of working memory on adolescents' algebraic ability and the transferability of training effects. Therefore, we conducted the current investigation with Chinese adolescents. In a correlational study (n = 218), we identified a positive association between n-back working memory and the ability to solve algebraic word and equation problems. In a subsequent training study, the experimental group (n = 28) underwent adaptive n-back working memory training for 20 days, resulting in enhanced working memory performance. However, no improvements in algebraic performance were observed in the experimental group compared to either the passive control (n = 22) or the active control group (n = 28). Together, while n-back working memory performance is associated with better algebraic performance, leveraging training gains of working memory to enhance algebra learning presents challenges. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are presented.

AB In an era of rapid technological advancement-particularly with the accelerated development of artificial intelligence and digital technologies-entrepreneurship enables firms to dynamically adjust their strategies in response to environmental uncertainty and helps them maintain sustainable competitive advantages over time. As a key concept in entrepreneurship research, entrepreneurial orientation (EO) has long attracted scholarly attention. However, existing studies on EO have primarily focused on its specific outcomes, while insufficient attention has been paid to its antecedents from the perspective of internal threats. Under the threat of performance shortfalls, firms' strategic choices are influenced not only by resource constraints but also by managerial cognitive biases. Drawing on Behavioral Theory of the Firm, we explore the moderating roles of managerial overconfidence and myopia in the relationship between performance shortfalls and EO. This study aims to uncover the cognitive "black box" behind why some firms are more likely to trigger entrepreneurial behavior in adverse situations. Based on panel data from 2822 A-share listed companies in China spanning the period from 2009 to 2020, and using a fixed-effects regression model, our findings indicate that both historical and social performance shortfalls have significant positive effects on EO. Further analysis reveals that the positive impact of performance shortfalls on EO is attenuated under conditions of heightened managerial overconfidence and myopia. By enriching the boundary conditions of EO from a cognitive perspective, this study provides a theoretical explanation for how firms can engage in entrepreneurial behavior under threat by reducing cognitive biases, thereby offering both theoretical and managerial insights into how firms can maintain sustainable development under crisis conditions.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) remains a significant threat to global swine industry, with immunization strategies limited by viral genome variation and a lack of effective therapeutic drugs. The flavonoid compound chrysin has shown potential anti-PEDV activity, but its specific antiviral mechanisms remain unclear. This study validated the inhibitory effect of chrysin on PEDV using IFA and qPCR. Additionally, Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on PEDV-infected Vero cells with and without chrysin treatment to reveal its antiviral mechanism. The results showed that 5813 DEGs at 12 hpi and 3374 DEGs at 24 hpi, with enrichment in pathways related to transcription, translation, metabolism, innate immunity, and apoptosis. Notably, KEGG analysis indicated that Chrysin regulate PEDV-induced apoptosis by modulating the TNF, MAPK, and p53 signaling pathways, which might antagonize PEDV infection. Subsequent results confirmed that chrysin can significantly downregulate the reactive ROS levels and cell apoptosis rate induced by PEDV infection (P<0.05), and inhibit the activation of the JNK and p53 pathways, including the phosphorylation of ASK1, JNK, and p53. Chrysin also significantly reduced cleaved caspase 3/8/9 levels and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios, thereby affecting PEDV N protein expression (P < 0.05). Moreover, similar inhibitory effects on PEDV can also be achieved through the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p53 inhibitor PFT-alpha. These findings revealed that chrysin can antagonize PEDVinduced apoptosis through the ROS/JNK/p53 signaling axis, thereby inhibiting viral replication. This study provides a scientific basis for developing chrysin as a novel anti-PEDV drug and offers insights into the screening and research of antiviral drug targets.

AB The confinement effect of the boron oxide layer has attracted significant attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, we introduce a strategically designed Pd@boron oxide-boron nitride hybrid (Pd@BOX/ BN) catalyst, synthesized via pyrolysis, impregnation, reduction, and water treatment processes, for catalyzing the Heck reaction. Structural analyses reveal highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles encapsulated by tunable BOX layers, with phase transitions (NH4B5O8-* H3BO3-* BOX) occurring during hydrogen reduction. Increasing the reduction temperature from 450 degrees C to 700 degrees C resulted in the formation of thicker BOX layers, while water treatment partially removed the surface BOX. The post-water treatment catalyst (Pd@BOX/BN-R700-W) exhibited activity 5.8 and 17.5 times higher than those of Pd@BOX/BN-R600 and untreated Pd@BOX/BN-R700 in the Heck reaction, respectively. This enhanced activity is attributed to the optimized BOX layer thickness and confinement effects. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations of the substrate scope demonstrated that Pd@BOX/BN-R700-W exhibited superior catalytic activity compared to other catalysts. This is accompanied by notable stability and reusability, as evidenced by a yield retention exceeding 93 % after fourteen cycles and minimal palladium leaching of 0.13 %. This study underscores the efficacy of BOX layers confinement engineering as a robust approach for developing durable and highly efficient catalysts in Heck coupling reactions.

AB The change in vegetation activity along elevational gradients holds important value in maintaining biodiversity and function of ecosystems. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), a highly climate-sensitive region, has undergone pronounced warming in recent decades, with its complex terrain and diverse climatic conditions driving variability in vegetation activity along elevational gradients. In this study, we utilized 250 m resolution leaf area index (LAI) records to investigate the elevation dependence of grassland greenness on the TP. Our results indicate that grassland LAI across the entire TP decreased with increasing elevation at a rate of 1.16 m2 m-2 km-1. However, marked spatial differences were observed: LAI decreased with elevation mainly in the energy-limited regions, i. e., eastern TP (accounting for 68.4 % of TP grassland), but increased with elevation predominantly in the waterlimited areas, i.e., western TP (accounting for 31.6 % of TP grassland). From 2000 to 2021, rising temperatures have driven an overall increase in grassland LAI across the TP. However, the increasing rate declined with elevation at a rate of 0.01 m2 m-2 y-1 km-1, resulting in a 25.93 % increase in the elevation dependence of greenness and thereby intensifying greenness heterogeneity along elevation. Spatially, 42.4 % of grassland areas exhibited more homogeneous grassland greenness along elevation, while 57.6 % showed increasing heterogeneity, reflecting a fragmented distribution across the TP. These patterns were attributed to the spatial variability in the elevational variations of grassland sensitivities to climate change. These findings enhance our understanding of vegetation dynamics and responses to global change in mountainous ecosystems.

AB This paper studies the issue of non-fragile dissipative load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems. Firstly, the impacts of high penetration wind power (HPW) and multiple time-varying delays (MTD) are considered to establish the LFC model. Then, reconfiguration technology is employed, improving the computational efficiency of stability analysis. Especially, this technology can dynamically partition the model according to time delays. Subsequently, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) is constructed, which includes delay terms, effectively reflecting the impact of multiple delays on stability analysis. Next, the novel integral inequality is used to solve the integral terms in the LKF, thereby significantly reducing the conservatism of the stability criterion. In addition, the non-fragile dissipative controller (NFDC) is designed, considering controller gain disturbances. It solves two types of uncertainty problems and thus improves the robustness of the power system. Finally, the superiority of the stability criterion and the effectiveness of the control method are verified through simulation experiments.

AB An efficient TCCA/PhSH-mediated regioselective hydroethoxylation and hydromethoxylation of allenamides via a radical process was developed to create a workable route to gamma-oxygenated enamides. This process is highly regioselective, affording (E)-gamma-oxygenated enamides in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the ethoxy radical was formed through the activation of TCCA/PhSH, which subsequently added to the terminal carbon of allenamides to form a vinyl radical intermediate. The efficiency of the gram-scale reaction suggests the potential industrial application of this synthetic method. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for metal catalysts, representing a significant advancement in green chemistry practices.

AB Children are not only concerned about fairness but also care for others. This study examined how experimentally induced empathic concern influences children's responses to inequity, particularly when fairness considerations may conflict with empathy-driven motivations. A sample of 10- to 12-year-old children (N = 111, 62 boys, 49 girls) from China were randomly assigned to an empathic or non-empathic condition and completed multiple rounds of ultimatum and dictator games, acting as recipients and proposers. The results showed that children in the empathic concern condition were more likely to accept disadvantageous offers (F (1, 109) = 10.723, p = 0.001) and reject advantageous offers (F (1, 109) = 11.200, p = 0.001) than those in the non-empathic condition. Furthermore, in the dictator game, children in the empathic condition shared significantly more resources with the same protagonist (F (1, 109) = 110.740, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that empathic concern affects children's inequity aversion and that empathic concern takes priority in guiding children's inequity aversion when it conflicts with the fairness criterion. Moreover, our findings suggest that altruistic motivations potentially play a role in children's responses to their inequity aversion.

AB Rapid response speed and structural reversibility are critical yet challenging performance metrics for practical visual photonic crystal (PC) sensor applications. This work reports a supramolecular liquid crystal-photonic crystal (LC-PC) composite film with a hierarchically porous inverse opal architecture, exhibiting ultrafast and reversible pH-responsive color change. The composite film shows a remarkable shift in reflection wavelength of up to 245 nm, with a complete color transition occurring within 1 s under both acidic and alkaline conditions. The film maintains excellent reversibility and optical stability over 50 repeated pH-response cycles, highlighting its outstanding durability and practical utility. The film also exhibits excellent rewritable ability under acidic and alkaline stimulation. A molecular templating strategy was employed to regulate porosity by varying the content and size of small-molecule hydrogen-bonding templates, thereby elucidating the impact of internal structure on responsiveness. The results confirm that the generation of appropriate pores significantly enhances response performance and spectral tunability. This work presents a practical pathway for designing fast, stable, and reusable optical sensing platforms for real-time environmental monitoring and display applications. Moreover, the molecular templating approach demonstrated here offers a promising strategy for the controllable design of materials with specific recognition capabilities in future sensing applications.

AB Understanding the activity patterns of a species is essential for developing sound conservation and management plans. In this study, we used a camera-trapping technique to determine the activity patterns of bharal (Pseudois nayaur) in a marginal population in Wolong National Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China. Our results showed that these animals preferred to be active in the daytime from 08:00 to 20:00, with an activity peak between 10:00 and 14:00. In addition, we found that the species had a seasonal activity pattern with higher activity frequency in summer than in winter and that bharal were most active in a temperature range of 3-11 degrees C and at night with a waxing crescent moon, implying that the activity rhythm of the species is an adaptation to a subtropical high-altitude alpine area with vertical zonation in temperature. The pattern of movement and activity was also correlated with the moon phase.

DE federated semi-supervised learning; convergence rate; linear speedup;
   quasi-Monte Carlo techniques; partial client participation
AB Federated semi-supervised learning (Fed-SSL) has emerged as a powerful framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data distributed across clients. To reduce communication overhead, real-world deployments often adopt partial client participation, where only a subset of clients is selected in each round. However, under non-i.i.d. data distributions, the choice of client sampling strategy becomes critical, as it significantly affects training stability and final model performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel federated averaging semi-supervised learning algorithm, called FedAvg-SSL, that considers two sampling approaches, uniform random sampling (standard Monte Carlo) and a structured lattice-based sampling, inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques, which ensures more balanced client participation through structured deterministic selection. On the client side, each selected participant alternates between updating the global model and refining the pseudo-label model using local data. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that FedAvg-SSL achieves a sublinear convergence rate with linear speedup. Extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical findings but also demonstrate the advantages of lattice-based sampling in federated learning, offering insights into the interplay among algorithm performance, client participation rates, local update steps, and sampling strategies.

AB Alpine ungulates exemplify climate vulnerability through their spatiotemporal adaptation strategies, yet integrated analyses of these dimensions remain scarce. Here, we investigated how bharal (Pseudois nayaur) in Giant Panda National Park adjusts both time-activity budgets and spatial distributions under extreme seasonal conditions. We deployed a network of 50 infrared cameras along altitudinal transects (3300-4500 m) during summer and winter. We extracted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from satellite imagery for each camera site and calculated the Relative Abundance Index (RAI) to quantify activity intensity and assess its seasonal variation. Our results revealed two key adaptations. (i) Temporal compression: Activity intensity in winter was reduced by 66% compared to summer (RAI: 0.85 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.21; p < 0.01) and exhibited a weaker diurnal-nocturnal contrast (p < 0.05). (ii) Spatial contraction: The bharal's altitudinal range narrowed by 73% from summer (3685-4248 m) to winter (3859-4012 m), accompanied by a significant decrease in NDVI (summer: 0.70 +/- 0.14 vs. winter: 0.14 +/- 0.06; p < 0.05). These findings reveal a dual-phase adaptation in bharal: expanding activity and range in resource-rich summers and contracting both in winter to conserve energy. By integrating infrared camera data with satellite-derived NDVI, our approach highlights how alpine ungulates respond to seasonal challenges and provides a foundation for predicting climate-driven shifts in high-elevation ecosystems.

AB Geo-distributed machine learning (Geo-DML) usually uses a hierarchical training architecture, local parameter synchronization (LPS) within data center and global parameter synchronization (GPS) between data centers. Compared to fast LAN bandwidth, the heterogeneous and scarce WAN bandwidth becomes one of the main bottlenecks of training performance for Geo-DML. Fortunately, the emerging optical technologies render the modern WAN topology reconfigurable, which has been adopted to improve the performance of some traditional traffic with the help of software-defined networking (SDN). However, the reconfigurable WAN topology is often overlooked by most schemes aimed at accelerating Geo-DML. In this paper, we propose AdaptivePS, an adaptive global parameter synchronization scheduling scheme that leverages the reconfigurable feature of WAN topology and the training characteristics to speed up Geo-DML training. Specifically, mathematical optimization models considering the topology construction and parameter synchronization scheduling are firstly established. Then AdaptivePS solves the mathematical models through relaxing and deterministic rounding scheme, obtaining the deployment of global aggregation nodes, wavelength allocation, path and rate allocation. The simulation results based on real WAN topologies show that compared to RoWAN, RAPIER and Baseline, AdaptivePS can reduce global communication time (GCT) by up to 73.4 %, 86.7 %, 96.2 %, respectively. This demonstrates that AdaptivePS can effectively cope with different network environments, with the help of adaptive selection of global aggregation nodes, reconfigurable topology, and mathematical model based scheduling.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the reliable detection and analysis of white matter (WM) using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signal. This paper studies the multifractal spontaneous in WM based on the HCP test-retest datasets. Precisely: (1) multifractal in the WM; (2) the source of multifractal; (3) difference and similarity between the multifractal of WM and gray matter (GM). Results showed that WM appears to be multifractal and significantly different from GM, but the variability of brain regions in WM was smaller than that in GM. For example, in WM, ('Fornix', 'Inferior cerebellar peduncle L', 'Superior cerebellar peduncle R', 'Posterior corona radiata R', and 'Uncinate fasciculus L') had higher multifractal scores than other regions; but in GM, the degree of multifractal in the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe was higher than that of different regions. Besides, the source of multifractality is primarily composed of heavy-tailed probability distributions and long-range dependence, particularly heavy-tailed probability distributions. In addition, the ICC of multifractal in GM or WM increases with the increase of sample points, but the growth trend decreases. The ICC of multifractal in GM or WM decreased with the rise of the subject numbers, but when this number was >36, the ICC did not significantly change. Besides, the ICC value of multifractal in GM and WM did not change significantly with the change of smooth size between 4 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm full-width half-maximum. The results provide a reference for understanding the spontaneous neuronal fluctuations in WM.

AB BACKGROUND Exploring and establishing appropriate fermentation conditions is critical for enhancing the quality of silage in high-altitude regions. This study evaluated the effects of different environmental conditions and additives on the nutritional value, molecular structure, and ruminal degradation parameters of oat silage. A total of 72 forage bags were assigned to 12 treatments (3 additives x 4 environments). Additives included lactic acid bacteria (LAB), organic acids (OA), and a control (CON). Environmental conditions were low-altitude ambient (LA), high-altitude ambient (HA), high-altitude glasshouse (HG), and high-altitude constant temperature (HC). All samples were ensiled for 42 days before analysis. RESULTS The LA group exhibited the highest levels of lactic acid, acetic acid and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N). LAB treatment yielded the highest acetic acid levels, while OA treatment showed the highest NH3-N (P < 0.05). For nutritional fractions, the HC group had the lowest non-fiber carbohydrates (P < 0.05). The LA group had the highest ammonia content (P < 0.05). OA treatment reduced the neutral-detergent fiber and acid-detergent insoluble protein contents more than CON and LAB treatments, while the LAB treatment had the lowest ammonia content (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed carbohydrates positively correlated with the peak height of total carbohydrate sub-peak II. The heights of the amide I region, alpha-helix, and beta-sheet, were positively correlated with crude protein and soluble protein contents. For ruminal fermentation parameters, the HG group showed the highest volatile fatty acids concentrations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION OA improves oat silage quality under HA condition, whereas high-quality fermentation could be achieved without additives under HG condition. (c) 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

ID BIOSYNTHESIS
AB Lamiophlomis rotata (Benth.) Kudo, an endangered medicinal plant endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (altitude of 3100-5000 m), faces conservation challenges due to wild resource scarcity and cultivation difficulties. This investigation employed a gradient nitrogen stress system (N1-N4) with a nitrogen-free control (CK) to decipher its nitrogen adaptation mechanisms. Key findings revealed: (1) superior biomass accumulation, SPAD content, and total nitrogen levels in N1 compared to N4; (2) N4-induced suppression of antioxidant enzymes concurrent with elevated secondary metabolites; (3) transcriptomic perturbations in nitrogen metabolism, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic pathways; (4) identification of eight nitrogen metabolism-related genes and eight iridoid synthase-associated genes exhibiting stress intensity-dependent expression patterns. Notably, key enzymatic activities (NR, Nrt, CA, GS, FM, DXS, NM) demonstrated unimodal responses peaking at N3 intensity. The species demonstrated nitrogen conservation strategies through enhanced assimilation and metabolic diversion into secondary biosynthesis, providing critical insights for alpine medicinal plant cultivation.

AB In order to investigate the infection status of Cryptosporidium in O. curzoniae and B. grunniens in Zoige County, Sichuan Province, fecal samples from B. grunniens and gastrointestinal contents from captured O. curzoniae were collected between March and December 2023 from five townships (Dazhasi, Axi, Hongxing, Tangke, and Maixi). Genomic DNA was extracted, and nested PCR targeting the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium was performed. PCR-positive products were sequenced, trimmed, aligned, and subjected to phylogenetic analysis to determine species and genotypes. A total of 242 samples were obtained, of which 20 were Cryptosporidium SSU rRNA-positive, yielding an overall detection rate of 8.3% (20/242). The detection rates of O. curzoniae and B. grunniens were 7.0% (8/114) and 9.4% (12/128), respectively. Among the five sampling sites, Maixi town exhibited the highest detection rate (32.4%, 11/44), followed by Hongxing town (15.2%, 7/46) and Tangke town (4.6%, 2/44). Phylogenetic analysis detected an unidentified Cryptosporidium sp. in O. curzoniae, while C. bovis (n = 10) and C. ryanae (n = 2) were detected in B. grunniens. These findings demonstrate that Cryptosporidium infections are present in both O. curzoniae and B. grunniens in Zoige County, with notable differences in infection rates and species composition. Continued surveillance of Cryptosporidium in local livestock and wildlife is warranted to provide critical data for regional public health management.

AB In order to explore the effect of 60Co-gamma irradiation on the quality of Tibetan medicine preparations, this study selected Pazhu powder (PP) which has complex and diverse components for research. PP was irradiated at doses of 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 kGy of 60Co-gamma, Then the effects on color, odor, structural characterization, chemical composition and antioxidant activity were investigated. Results showed that after irradiation, the color, the content of aldehydes and ketones in volatile components were not changed. While the structure and the HPLC fingerprints changed slightly. However, the contents of terpenes, alkanes, amides and alcohols in the volatile components, and all the non-volatile components showed a dose-related decline in irradiated samples. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity increased after irradiation. These findings suggest that 60Co-gamma irradiation has a great influence on the chemical composition of PP. It's necessary to cautiously set reasonable irradiation dose for Tibetan medicine preparations.

AB Small enterprises, as vital engines of economic growth in emerging economies, face unprecedented challenges in the era of digital economy. We investigate how digital infrastructure expansion affects the output of small enterprises. Using the 'Broadband China Strategy' as a quasi-natural experiment, we analyse administrative data from the National Tax Survey employing the staggered difference-in-differences method. Our baseline results show that, compared to control groups, digital infrastructure expansion reduces the output of small enterprises in pilot cities by 2.62%. Mechanism test identifies two primary channels: stronger market competition and resource constraint disadvantages. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the negative effects are more pronounced in regions with low digital finance development, low internet penetration, low fiscal deficit, and high marketization, in primary/tertiary industries and more concentrated markets, and among non-exporting enterprises. We further demonstrate that targeted income tax incentives effectively counteract these adverse effects, while accelerated depreciation policies show limited protective benefits. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the distributional consequences of digital infrastructure development, providing empirical evidence from China on how emerging economies can help small enterprises avoid the digitalization paradox.

AB The optimization of ventilation strategies in high-ceiling theater stage spaces is crucial for improving thermal comfort and energy efficiency. This study addresses the challenge of uneven temperature distribution and airflow stagnation in stage environments by employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different ventilation modes, including natural, mechanical, and hybrid systems. Six airflow organization scenarios were designed based on modifications to structural layout, equipment settings, and mechanical disturbances (e.g., fan integration). Key evaluation indicators such as temperature uniformity coefficient, airflow velocity, and exhaust efficiency were used to assess performance. The results show that a multi-dimensional optimization approach combining spatial adjustments and mechanical disturbances significantly reduced the average temperature from 26 degrees C to 23 degrees C and the temperature uniformity coefficient from 2.79 to 1.49. This study contributes a comprehensive design strategy for stage ventilation that improves comfort while minimizing energy consumption, offering practical implications for performance space design and HVAC system integration.

AB The yak (Bos grunniens) has exceptional hypoxia resilience, making it an ideal model for studying high-altitude adaptation. Here, we investigated the effects of oxygen concentration on yak cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the underlying molecular regulatory pathways using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolic analyses. Decreased oxygen levels significantly inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation and activity. Intriguingly, while the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content remained stable, we observed coordinated upregulation of mtDNA-encoded oxidative phosphorylation components. Live-cell metabolic assessment further demonstrated that hypoxia led to mitochondrial respiratory inhibition and enhanced glycolysis. RNA-seq analysis identified key hypoxia adaptation genes, including glycolysis regulators (e.g., HK2, TPI1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighting their involvement in metabolic regulation. The protein-protein interaction network identified three consensus hub genes across five topological algorithms (CCNA2, PLK1, and TP53) that may be involved in hypoxia adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of metabolic reprogramming underlying yak adaptation to hypoxia, providing valuable molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying high-altitude survival.

AB Belowground buds play a vital role in the clonal propagation and structural regulation of perennial herbaceous plants, especially in alpine environments, where vegetative renewal depends heavily on bud bank dynamics. However, the interactive effects of nitrogen addition and phenological stages on bud development and aboveground branching remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the responses of rhizome buds, tiller buds, and aboveground tiller types of Kentucky bluegrass to six nitrogen levels (0, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 g/m2) across five growth stages on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that moderate nitrogen input (N2, 9 g/m2) significantly enhanced total bud density, particularly at the heading and maturity stages, indicating a threshold response. Aboveground reproductive tiller density peaked at N2 (9 g/m2), while vegetative and total tiller densities plateaued beyond N3 (12 g/hm2), suggesting a diminishing marginal effect of nitrogen on aboveground tiller density. Furthermore, bud density showed stage-specific correlations with tiller types: vegetative tillers were primarily influenced at the heading stage, and reproductive tillers were mainly influenced at the mature stage, with weakened associations in senescence. These findings highlight the phenological specificity and non-linear response of clonal grass regeneration to nitrogen input and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing nutrient management in cold alpine grasslands.

AB Atrium design significantly influences the energy performance of public buildings, especially in climate-sensitive regions. This study develops a parametric optimization framework integrating automated modeling, large-scale simulation, and meta-sample analysis to evaluate the impact of eight atrium design parameters on energy use. A benchmark model library of 39,202 atrium configurations was constructed to assess heating, cooling, and lighting energy consumption. Sensitivity analysis revealed that atrium area and internal openness are the most influential factors for cooling and heating demand. South-facing atriums consistently showed lower annual cooling energy demand (CEUI) and annual heating energy demand (HEUI). One actionable strategy is reducing internal openness (Int) and increasing external openness (Out) to significantly lower energy use. Multi-objective optimization demonstrated up to 40.29 % reduction in annual total energy demand (EUI). The meta-sample model, validated against full-sample statistics, achieved 87.6 % computational savings with maximum output error of only 0.35 %. These findings provide quantitative design guidance for early-stage atrium optimization and enable fast integration with parametric BIM workflows.

AB The sustainable renovation of traditional buildings is essential for cultural heritage conservation and green urbanization. This study examines traditional Hui minority dwellings in western China, comparing protected historic homes with modern self-built houses. By introducing the Thermal Comfort Time Ratio (TCTR), the study quantitatively evaluates indoor thermal comfort and the effectiveness of passive design strategies. Key factors such as natural ventilation, building orientation, and envelope materials are analyzed. Results show that traditional protected dwellings have a TCTR of 1.96 %, while self-built houses reach 3.79 %. Optimized designs-including concrete walls, northwest orientation, and 900 x 1200 mm windows-enhance TCTR to 4.01 %, a 104.6 % improvement over traditional homes and 5.8 % over current self-built ones. Temperature retention also increases by 70.1 % and 62 % compared to traditional and self-built houses, respectively. Improved airflow further enhances thermal comfort. This research provides a performance-based framework for renovating ethnic dwellings sustainably, balancing thermal efficiency with cultural preservation. The findings offer guidance for low-carbon, climate-responsive design strategies applicable to traditional housing across diverse regions.

AB Herbivore exclusion is a widespread practice used to restore and manage degraded grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. However, experimental evidence for the long-term impacts of herbivore exclusion on ecosystem structure and functioning of mountainous grasslands is still largely lacking. Here, we examined long-term herbivore exclusion impacts on ecological functions across four typical grassland types (alpine screes, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and swamp meadow) along an elevation gradient on the southern slope of Nyaiqentanglha Mountain. The results showed that long-term herbivore exclusion had divergent influences on ecosystem functioning of mountainous grasslands, with the EMF tended to decrease in swamp meadow and alpine steppe but increase in alpine meadow and alpine screes. In addition, herbivore exclusion tended to decrease the aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality (AEMF) but had a trend to increase the belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (BEMF). Path analysis of the structural equation model showed that herbivore exclusion regulated EMF and BEMF mainly through altering plant productivity and soil nutrients while influenced the AEMF primary by affecting plant diversity. These findings revealed that the impacts of long-term herbivore exclusion on multiple ecological functions greatly depended on plant diversity, productivity, and soil nutrients, with the mountainous grasslands mostly experiencing decrease trends on ecosystem multi-functionality. The findings also highlighted the fundamental importance of developing proper grazing management practice for protecting ecosystem multifunctionality in the widespread mountainous grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Nardostachys jatamansi (D. Don) DC., an aromatic and medicinal herb belonging to the Nardostachys genus within the Caprifoliaceae family, is globally well-known for its attractive perfume and health-promoting properties. However, genomic information specific to N. jatamansi remains largely unexplored. In this study, the first de novo assembly of the N. jatamansi genome was presented which spans approximately 2.88 Gb with the contig N50 of 9.92 Mb and scaffold N50 of 40.09 Mb. Using Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 98.53 % of the assembled sequences into 78 pseudochromosomes (6n = 13), a result corroborated by chromosome (cytogenetic) analysis. The genome comprises 92.33 % repeat sequences, including 73.82 % TEs and 18.51 % tandem repeats, as well as a total of 174,054 protein-coding genes, of which 93.62 % have been functionally annotated in databases such as NR, GO, KEGG, Interpro, and others. In addition, our analysis identified 4144 tRNAs, 7537 rRNAs, 707 miRNAs, and 3400 snRNAs within the genome. Comparative genomics revealed that N. jatamansi exhibited high genetic redundancy. Phylogenetic analysis supports the current knowledge that the new APG IV classification system places N. jatamansi within the Caprifoliaceae family. Genes from the most expanded gene families, especially the TPS gene cluster at the end of chromosome 3A, are likely involved in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids in N. jatamansi. Hopefully, our work would provide a valuable basis for revealing natural product-related biosynthetic pathways in N. jatamansi and advancing evolutionary studies within the Caprifoliaceae family.

AB Lipids in milk fat globules (MFGs) are critical for nutrition and health, and yak milk, rich in milk fat, is vital for herders. This study used absolute quantitative lipidomics to compare the differences in MFG lipids in mature milk between yak (Y) and German Simmental cattle (GS). Compared with GS, Y showed higher milk fat (5.37 +/- 1.70 vs. 2.31 +/- 1.27 %), larger MFG size (D-[4,D-3]: 8.69 vs. 4.31 mu m). 2414 lipid species from 43 lipid subclasses in Y and GS were identified, and 187 significantly different lipids (SDLs; variable importance for the projection (VIP) > 1, fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.67 with P < 0.05) were then screened out. TG(18:0_18:1_20:1), TG(18:1_18:3_18:3), Hex1Cer(d14:2_16:0), and TG(4:0_16:0_23:0) were potential lipid biomarkers. These SDLs involved 23 KEGG metabolic pathways, with sphingolipid metabolism being the most relevant. Our findings enhance understanding of MFG lipid differences between Y and GS, promote the development of functional yak milk product, and lay a quality identification foundation.

AB Background The conjugation of polyphenols to proteins provides a method for modifying the structure and properties of proteins.Methods This study investigated the roles of ultrasound in the conjugation of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with whey protein isolate (WPI) and its effects on the structural characteristics and properties.Results and discussion The formation of EGCG-WPI conjugates (EW) resulted in a decrease in free amino groups and thiol groups in WPI, accompanied by an increase in size and thermal stability. Consequently, this conjugation inhibited the immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding capacity and improved the emulsifying properties of WPI. Furthermore, ultrasound facilitated the interaction by producing larger size of conjugates (U-EW), increasing the binding affinity from 5.8 x 105 M-1 to 1.7 x 106 M-1 and the polyphenol bound equivalent from 80.4 +/- 1.3 mg/g to 98.2 +/- 1.9 mg/g compared to EW. It induced the greater changes in the secondary structure and surface hydrophobicity, thereby promoting greater participation of beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) in conjugation with EGCG, and resulting in a higher inhibition rate of IgE binding capacity, an enhanced emulsifying property of U-EW. These findings will potentially expand the applications of WPI in the food industry.

TI STVMamba: precipitation nowcasting with spatiotemporal prediction model
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
DE Spatiotemporal prediction; Precipitation nowcasting; Vision Mamba;
   Two-tier architecture
AB A lightweight rainfall nowcasting model is required by Sichuan provincial meteorological bureaus. Deep learning methods such as recurrent, convolutional, and Transformer models have been applied to precipitation prediction. However, recurrent models struggle with suboptimal parallel computational efficiency and error accumulation, convolutional models face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies, and Transformer models are limited by their quadratic time complexity. The Spatial-Temporal Vision Mamba (STVMamba) is proposed, a novel spatiotemporal prediction model specifically designed for precipitation nowcasting. STVMamba achieves high parallel computational efficiency, operates with linear time complexity, and excels at modeling long-range dependencies, overcoming the shortcomings of previous deep learning methods. Specifically, the STVMamba utilises a Spatial-Temporal Selective Scan (STSS) module to capture global spatiotemporal relationships, while a Spatial-Temporal Depthwise Separable Convolution (STDSConv) module is used to learn local spatiotemporal relationships. Furthermore, the two-tier architecture of the STVMamba explicitly learns spatiotemporal relationships across both small and large spatial scales within meteorological data. We evaluate STVMamba on three benchmark datasets: the Sichuan radar echo dataset, the HKO-7 radar echo dataset, and the satellite-based IMERG dataset. On the Sichuan dataset, STVMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across MSE, SSIM, and CSI-10 metrics. On the HKO-7 dataset, it outperforms existing models in terms of MSE, CSI-10, and CSI-20. On the IMERG dataset, it achieves superior results in SSIM and CSI-0.5, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness across diverse geoclimatic conditions and data modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/CUITMIR/STVMamba.

AB Let R and T be commutative rings, and let phi : R -> T be a w-linked homomorphism. Let w phi be a star operation on T with respect to the w-linked homomorphism phi. Using the w phi-operation, we introduce concepts such as GV phi-torsion modules, GV phi-torsion-free modules, w phi- modules, GV phi-divisible modules, w phi-finitely generated modules, and w phi- finitely presented modules. Furthermore, we define w phi-flat modules and w phi-coherent rings in a natural manner and study them with the aid of w phi- Nataga rings. In particular, we provide a new version of Chase's theorem for w phi-coherent rings and an exact version of the Eakin-Nagata theorem for w-coherent rings.

AB C. macrophylla and C. tangutorum, collectively known as Shigecai in Chinese, are consumed as special and nutritious vegetables by the Tibetan, Qiang, and Yi communities in China. However, due to the insufficient knowledge of their phytochemical compositions and health benefits, the industrial utilization of these species in the food sector remains limited. Although Shigecai leaves contain substantial pectic polysaccharides, their chemical structures and biological activities remain unknown, which ultimately restricts their industrial utilization. Thus, to address this gap, this study systematically analyzed the chemical characteristics and biological functions of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I)- enriched pectin from C. tangutorum (CTHDP) and C. macrophylla (CMHDP) leaves. The results demonstrate that Shigecai leaves are promising sources of RG-I-enriched pectin, with yields of 57.63-65.21 mg/g dry weight. In addition, both CTHDP and CMHDP exhibited highly similar chemical and structural properties, dominated by RG-I and homogalacturonan (HG) pectin regions, with RG-I ratios of 60.14-63.33 mol%. Furthermore, both samples demonstrated notable antioxidant ability, antiglycation activity, prebiotic potency, and immunoregulatory effects, which were strongly linked to their bound polyphenol content, uronic acid content, and molecular weight. These findings support the industrial utilization of Shigecai and establish Shigecai-derived RG-I-enriched pectin as a promising functional food ingredient.

AB Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has garnered increased attention as a result of its persistent symptoms, which undermine patients' quality of life. Fudosteine has substantial advantages in the treatment of COPD due to its high efficacy and low adverse effects. In this study, Fudosteine sulfonamide derivatives Series I and amine derivatives Series II were designed and synthesized, and their biological activities were evaluated. The results showed that compound 6f had outstanding anti-inflammatory action with an IC50 of 1.08 mmol/L, and a higher antioxidant capacity than the lead molecule. At the same time, molecular docking investigations have revealed that compound 6f establishes hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with the MUC5AC protein. Furthermore, derivative 1f inhibited PDE4A1 enzyme activity five times more than Fudosteine. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging tests demonstrated that all examined substances had higher antioxidant activity than Fudosteine. This study established a solid foundation for further research into COPD drug therapy.

AB We investigated the effects of ultrasonic treatment combined with the application of 1 % to 9 % (w/w) epigallocatechin (EGC) on the structure, physicochemical properties, and digestibility of highland barley starch (HS). The addition of EGC was based on starch gelatinization, causing the particle morphology and crystal structure to disappear, resulting in a layered network structure. X-ray diffraction results showed that ultrasonic combined with EGC treatment promoted the formation of a V-shaped complex, and the crystallinity increased from 0.77 % to 6.63 %. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer results showed that the interaction between HS and EGC inhibited the interaction between starch chains, altered the double helix structure of starch, and reduced its short-range ordered arrangement. 1H NMR analysis indicated that HS and EGC were primarily bound through hydrogen bonding. Ultrasonic treatment enhanced the interactions, making HS-epigallocatechin (HSEGC) complexes more resistant. The HSEGC complex was beneficial for reducing easily digestible starch. Compared with ultrasonicated HS, the swelling capacity and thermal stability of HSEGC complexes were improved, and their color was brighter. In conclusion, ultrasonic treatment combined with EGC addition can modulate the physicochemical and digestibility properties of HS. This study exhibits the potential application of ultrasound technology and HSEGC complexes within the food industry.

AB Understanding how fine-root resource acquisition strategies respond to yak grazing is critical for comprehending the structure and functioning of alpine meadow ecosystems. However, the impact of varying intensities of yak grazing on these strategies remains unclear. We utilized a 9-year yak grazing intensity experiment comprising ungrazing, lightly grazing, moderately grazing, and heavily grazing treatments to analyze eight fine-root morphological and chemical traits across three dominant species: Saussurea japonica, Kobresia pygmaea, and Elymus nutans. Our findings revealed that all grazing intensities significantly (p < 0.05) increased specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA), while decreasing root average diameter (RAD) across all three species. Compared with un-grazing treatment, root carbon content (RCC) showed a weak increase (p > 0.05), while root tissue density (RTD) exhibited minor variations under different grazing intensity. Grazing intensity significantly influenced the fine-root resource acquisition strategies for each species, with a transition from an "outsourcing" of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi to a "do-it-yourself" resource uptake strategy accompanying increasing grazing intensity. Additionally, our results indicated that grazing intensity indirectly influences morphological and chemical traits of fine roots via altering soil properties and aboveground biomass. Overall, our results provide new evidence that long-term yak grazing modifies the fine-root resource acquisition strategies in alpine meadow ecosystems, enhancing our understanding of plant ecological responses to anthropogenic activities.

AB Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with depressive symptoms, with reinfection posing a risk to mental health. However, few studies have examined the impact of the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection on perceived stress and depressive symptoms. The present study aimed to examine whether the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with perceived stress and subsequent depressive symptoms and to determine whether socioeconomic status (SES) moderates this mediating effect. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 30,053 Chinese residents (15,011 males, 49.9 %) aged 19-107 years were recruited between June 20 and August 31, 2023. The participants recalled their frequency of SARSCoV-2 infection. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were measured via the Perceived Stress Scale-4 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. SES was assessed via a 7-point self-report scale. MANOVA, ANOVA, and conditional indirect effect analysis were performed. Results: Residents with one SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced fewer depressive symptoms than those with no infections. Perceived stress mediated the association between one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduced depressive symptoms, with higher SESs amplifying this association. Conversely, among individuals with multiple infections, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased depressive symptoms. Conclusion: In the postpandemic era, repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections still significantly affect residents' mental health. Attention should be paid to the psychological stress and depressive symptoms of high-risk groups, such as individuals with a history of repeated infections.

AB Introduction Sperm damage from oxidative stress is common in semen cryopreservation. Natural antioxidants for frozen semen are largely unexplored. Artesunate (ART), derived from Artemisia annua and used for malaria treatment, shows potential as a frozen semen antioxidant.Methods We investigated the effects of various ART concentrations (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mM) on yak semen cryopreservation and examined the molecular mechanisms involved.Results Post-freezing, sperm quality markedly declined. However, 0.2 mM ART significantly improved sperm motility (both total and progressive) and reduced membrane damage. ART treatment effectively alleviated oxidative stress by reducing ROS levels and MDA content in the sperm while selectively upregulating SOD1 activity and protein levels, which are involved in maintaining DNA integrity and mitochondrial function.Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that ART exerts antioxidant effects via a SOD1-mediated mechanism, highlighting its potential to improve frozen semen quality and offering a novel strategy for cryopreserving sperm in other species.

AB This study aimed to carry out highly efficient and simple cross-coupling reactions of arylboronic acid with methyl dithiocarbamates for the synthesis of thioamide derivatives using Ni(acac)2(5 mol%)/TFP(5 mol%) as a catalyst. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the coupling reaction between arylboronic acid with methyl dithiocarbamates was carried out smoothly, and thioamides were obtained with 27-85% isolated yields. Furthermore, dithiocarbamate methyl esters with allyl, cyano, and acid-sensitive ketal functional groups were successfully coupled with phenylboronic acid to produce the desired product, thioamides, with a yield of 27-69%. Aromatic boronic acids with methoxy or formyl groups on the benzene ring were found to be compatible in this reaction system, and the corresponding thioamides were obtained with an isolated yield of 31-43%. A thioamide with 1-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl)piperazine structural units was prepared with a yield of 65%, which has the potential biological activity. However, this reaction system did not achieve satisfactory results for methyl 1H-imidazole-1-carbodithioate. The structures of all the target compounds were confirmed by melting point determination, HMRS, 1H NMR, and 13-CNMR. The broad functional group tolerance and consistent high efficiency at gram-scale synthesis make this protocol a potentially practical approach for producing thioamide derivatives. The method avoids the use of expensive transition metals, such as Pd, Ir, or Rh, and has the advantage of simple operation.

AB Background:Animacy is a key semantic property of nouns and an important factor influencing the processing of action metaphors.Methods:This study investigates how the animacy of nouns influences the processing of action metaphors in first (L1) and second (L2) languages by conducting an event-related potential study of Chinese English learners' brain activity during a semantic judgment task using Chinese (L1) and English (L2) action metaphor sentences as materials.Results:The results showed L1 conditions had shorter reaction times than L2 conditions, while high-animacy conditions produced longer reaction times than low-animacy ones; object-evoked N170 amplitudes did not differ significantly between L1 and L2, but in L2, high-animacy objects evoked smaller N170 amplitudes than low-animacy ones; the P200 amplitude evoked by L1 objects was larger than that evoked by L2 objects, with no significant difference between high- and low-animacy conditions; the N400 amplitude evoked by L1 objects was larger than that evoked by L2 objects, and high-animacy objects evoked larger N400 amplitudes than low-animacy ones only in L1.Conclusions:These findings suggest that in action metaphor processing, the animacy level of an object noun modulates semantic extraction and integration in L1, as well as the allocation of attentional resources for L2. However, overall, sentences with high-animacy objects were more difficult to comprehend than those with low-animacy objects. Additionally, regardless of the animacy level of an object noun, more attention and cognitive resources were allocated to L1 processing than to L2 processing, facilitating faster semantic access to sentences.

AB High-quality images can provide consumers with more product information, enhance purchase intention, and further affect the brand's economic and financial benefits. How to improve image quality has become a key challenge for online product presentations. As one of the most popular image processing tools, image super-resolution not only improves image quality with more details but also saves image storage space and transmission bandwidth. Therefore, in this study, we first review the relationship between image quality and consumer purchase intention. Based on the characteristics of product images containing multiple images with similar content, we then propose a novel reference-based super resolution method based on Fourier transform. The proposed Frequency-Spatial Aggregation block extracts complementary spatial and frequency features to activate more useful pixels. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters and faster running time. In addition, in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our method in the context of product images, we collect image pairs from e-commerce platforms and contribute a new dataset named PRSR dataset.

AB Background and Aims Bamboos, arborescent monocotyledons without secondary growth, often show top dieback during the dry season. The potential mechanism underlying bamboo top dieback and its association with culm hydraulic architecture and positive pressure dynamics remain unclear. We investigated how the axial scaling of anatomical traits influenced physiological performances of the culm top under drought conditions, as well as how seasonal changes in positive pressure were related to top dieback and culm height.Methods Variations in culm anatomical and physiological characteristics (hydraulic traits, leaf photosynthetic gas exchange and water potentials) along the longitudinal axis of a bamboo (Dendrocalamus membranaceus) were investigated and seasonal changes in positive pressure were monitored to reveal potential factors associated with top dieback.Key Results The hydraulically weighted mean vessel diameter (Dh) exhibited a widening pattern from the culm apex with a scaling exponent in the range reported for trees. However, Dh did not increase continuously and instead declined noticeably near the culm base. Theoretical hydraulic conductivity decreased to a low level near the culm top, where most of the resistance was located. The lower water potentials, maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate indicated that the culm top was subjected to severer water stress than the base part. Height supported by the maximum positive pressure declined from the wet season to the dry season, which was close to the measured culm height after top dieback.Conclusions This study suggests the potential impact of vessel widening pattern on water supply along the culm height, and the association of seasonal changes in positive pressure with culm height, and offers novel insights into understanding bamboo top dieback.

AB This paper is interesting in studying well-posedness and strong convergence analysis for stochastic space-time fractional wave equations driven by fractional Brownian sheet. We first discuss wellposedness of the original stochastic space-time fractional wave equation in terms of standard Picard's iteration argument and give regularity and H & ouml;lder continuity analysis of its mild solution. Afterwards, we introduce a Wong-Zakai approximation to fractional Brownian sheet using spectral basis so that a regularized stochastic space-time fractional wave equation is derived, and then the corresponding regularity, H & ouml;lder continuity, and error estimate of its regularized solution are also investigated. Further, we use spectral Galerkin method and backward Euler convolution quadrature scheme to discretize the regularized equation in space and time, respectively, and then we provide rigorously strong convergence analysis for the solution of discrete scheme. Finally, numerical examples are carried out to verify our theoretical convergence results.

AB Palmatine is an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from many medicinal plants with diverse pharmacological activities, with potential for the treatment of chronic metabolic disorders and infectious diseases. In the present study, a highly rapid, simple, and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an ultra-violet (<bold>UPLC-UV</bold>) method was developed and validated for the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of palmatine following single intramuscular injection to Partridge Shank chickens. The process was sensitive, with a lower limit of quantification and good linearity over the range of 0.005-10 mu g/mL for UPLC-UV in all biological matrices. Following a single intramuscular dose of 5 mg/kg b.w, palmatine was absorbed quickly and reached peak concentration (0.24 mu g/mL) at 0.19 h and was still present in plasma at 12 h with a concentration of 0.011 mu g/mL. The CL/F and Vd/F were 10.43 L<middle dot>h(-1)<middle dot>kg (-1) and 56.69 L/kg, respectively. The C-max values of palmatine in tissues decreased as follows: kidneys > liver > spleen > heart > lung > muscles, and were almost completely cleared from lungs 26 h after administration and were not detectable or significantly reduced in other tissues after 48 h. The results can provide a basis for exploring the therapeutic potential of palmatine and looking for new ways of wide clinical applications in poultry farming.

AB Land consolidation (LC) is vital for addressing land fragmentation and enhancing agricultural mechanisation, but it is often associated with farmland biodiversity loss. Preserving semi-natural habitats has been proposed as a solution, but their relative importance as refuges or resource providers for biodiversity at different LC intensities remains unclear. In a well-facilitated farmland demonstration area with high-intensity LC and the surrounding agricultural areas with low-intensity LC, we surveyed epigeic spiders in rice paddies and nearby semi-natural woodlands. We examined how LC intensity affected (1) spider communities activity density, species richness, and community composition in paddies and woodlands and (2) the influence of surrounding woodlands on spiders in paddies. Spider activity density in woodlands was higher than in paddies at high LC intensity but not at low LC intensity. Although spider species composition in paddies altered with LC intensity, that in woodlands remained unaffected. In the species-habitat network of generalist spiders, paddies with low LC intensity showed stronger interactions with woodlands than those with high LC intensity. While paddy spider species richness increased with landscape-scale woodland cover, their activity density increased only at low LC intensity. These results suggested that at high LC intensity, woodlands supported a larger proportion of spider communities across habitats, acting as more important refuges. At low LC intensity, woodlands benefited paddy spiders more effectively, serving as more important resources. These findings highlight the importance of preserving and managing semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes, considering their varying roles across LC intensities, to support biodiversity-friendly LC design and restoration.

AB Developing low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts to enhance the kinetics of the oxygen reduction/ evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is crucial for energy devices, such as metal-air batteries. In this study, a pyrolysis-free method was used to prepare a series of CoCu-bimetallic organic Frameworks (CoCu-BMOFs) electrocatalysts via cooparetion of cobalt (Co) and copper (Cu) ions with 1,2,4-triazoles. The optimal Co6Cu4BMOFs exhibited inferier ORR and OER activities in half cell comparing to commercial Pt/C + RuO2, but the maximum power density of Co4Cu6-BMOFs (268.35 mW cm- 2) in Zn-air battery surpassed that of Pt/C + RuO2 (214.65 mW cm- 2). Such enhancement could be attributed to the CoCu-tunable ratio in BMOFs, effectively activating the synergistic effects of Co-Nx and Cu-Nx, leading to a improved ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity. Our findings regarding the synergistic bimetallic active sites might offer a valuable path for the development of M- Nx electrocatalysts in pyrolysis-free strategy.

AB The $ O(1/t<^>2) $ O(1/t2) convergence rate of second-order dynamical systems with asymptotic vanishing viscous damping is faster than the $ O(1/t) $ O(1/t) rate of systems with fixed viscous damping in unconstrained and linear equality constrained optimization problems. We explore whether the performance of systems with vanishing viscous damping remains superior when both use time scaling. We compare the best polynomial convergence rates of vanishing damping systems with the best exponential convergence rates of a fixed damping system with time scaling for linear equality constrained problems. We prove that the primal-dual trajectory weakly converges to an optimal solution. Additionally, we present an inertial algorithm derived from the implicit discretization of the dynamical system, establishing exponential convergence rates for the primal-dual gap, feasibility measure, and objective value without assuming strong convexity. The sequence of iterates generated by the inertial algorithm weakly converges to an optimal solution when the objective function is proper, convex, and lower semicontinuous. These results align with those in the continuous setting.

AB Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology has made significant progress in obtaining the genomic information of organisms and is now the primary way to uncover genetic variation. However, due to the complexity of the genome and technical limitations, large genome segments remain ungenotyped. Imputation is a useful strategy for predicting missing genotypes. The accuracy and computing speed of imputation software are important criteria that should inform future developments in genomic research. In this study, the K-Means algorithm and multithreading were used to cluster reference individuals to reduce the number and improve the length of haplotypes in the subpopulation. We named this strategy "KBeagle". In the comparison test, we determined that the KBeagle-imputed dataset (KID) can identify more single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci associated with the specified traits compared to the Beagle-imputed dataset (BID), while also achieving much lower false discovery rates (FDRs) and Type I error rates under the same power of detection of association signals. We envision that the main application of KBeagle will focus on livestock sequencing studies under a strong genetic structure. In summary, we have generated an accurate and efficient imputation method, improving the imputation matching rate and calculation time.

AB This study investigates the design of omnidirectional antennas, using a characteristic mode analysis (CMA), and explores two distinct feeding methods. The first method employs equal-amplitude and in-phase excitation across all ports, whereas the second method utilizes equal-amplitude excitation with a 180 degrees phase difference between adjacent ports. Both designs achieve operating bandwidths of 2.45-2.58 GHz and 2.42-2.45 GHz, respectively, with peak gains of 4.1 dBi and 4.4 dBi at 2.45 GHz. The proposed antennas exhibited high gain and low-profile characteristics, making them well-suited for applications in wireless energy harvesting.

AB Yak (Bos grunniens) meat is popular with a unique flavor and high nutritional value. This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with rumen-protected methionine (RPM) on meat quality, fatty acid composition, volatile flavor compounds, and transcriptomics of Longissimus lumborum of yak. Twenty-four male Maiwa yaks were selected and assigned to four groups: basal diet (CON), or supplementation of 5 g/d (RPM5), 10 g/d (RPM10), and 15 g/d (RPM15) RPM. The dose-dependent effects of RPM levels were evaluated through linear or quadratic trend analysis. The results showed that diet supplementation with RPM increased the intramuscular fat contents, improved composition of volatile flavor compounds and the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. Compared to the CON group, there were 36, 84 and 23 up-regulated genes, and 85, 94 and 70 down-regulated genes in the RPM5, RPM10 and RPM15 groups, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed significant differentially expressed genes enrichment in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions across RPM5, RPM10, and RPM15 groups compared to the CON. KEGG pathway analysis revealed 99, 169, and 104 enriched pathways in RPM5, RPM10, and RPM15 groups, respectively. In summary, the addition of RPM to diets may provide new ideas and methods to improve meat quality of yaks.

AB The kinetic theory is employed to investigate the influence of opinion preferences and user connectivity in social networks on collective decision-making and its optimization control. Collective decision-making takes place not only through traditional offline approaches but also within social networks. To examine how collective decisions evolve in these networks, we establish a joint density function for decision-connectivity and develop two Boltzmann models, one incorporating a control term. Our model accounts for the overall connectivity distribution among individuals and their opinion preferences. In addition, we assume that each agent's connectivity determines the credibility of the opinions they present. Using the kinetic model, we study the evolution of average decisions and reveal how opinion preferences and connectivity within social networks influence collective decision-making.

AB Using panel data from Chinese listed companies between 2009 and 2022, this study examines the impact of cross-border e-commerce policy incentives on the application of artificial intelligence (AI), employing a staggered difference-in-differences approach. By treating the establishment of Cross-Border E-Commerce Comprehensive Pilot Areas (CECPAs) in China as a quasi-natural experiment, this analysis identifies significant positive effects, which operate through two primary channels: increased market competition and rising demand. The effects vary across firms, reflecting heterogeneity based on technological, industrial, locational, and organizational characteristics.

ID FERMENTATION
AB The production of artificial planted forage is important for the development of animal husbandry in the Qinghai--Tibet Plateau, and oat forage is one of the main artificial planted forages in the area. However, the suitable oat varieties for harvesting and preparing silage feed in this region are still unclear. To investigate suitable oat forage varieties for silage production and the potential feeding value of different oat forage varieties, 16 oat forage varieties planted in Qinghai Province were selected in this experiment. These oat forages were subjected to two treatments: a group with no inoculants (CK) and a group with self-selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants (IN). After 90 days of ensiling, silage quality and in vitro digestibility of the 16 oat forage varieties were determined. The results showed that all oat forage varieties ferment well after ensiling (pH < 4), the CK group had a silage pH range of 3.62-3.95, and the IN group had a silage pH range of 3.68-3.83. Tianyan No.1, Qingtian No.2, and Tianyan No.3 were in the top three in RFV and RFQ rankings in the CK group, while Qinghai 444, Tianyan No.1, and Tianyan No.3 were in the lead in GI rankings. Tianyan No.1, Qingtian No.2, and Everleaf 126 were in the lead in RFV and RFQ rankings in the IN group, while Qinghai 444, Titan, and Tianyan No.1 were in the top three in GI rankings. The dry matter digestibility and 72 h cumulative gas production of the IN group were higher than that of the CK group (p < 0.05). Based on principal component analysis and membership function comprehensive evaluation, Tianyan No.1, Qinghai 444, and Tianyan No.3 ranked the top three, demonstrating that these three oat forage varieties are suitable for silage processing in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.

DT Review
DE seawater electrolysis; value-added electrooxidation; hydrogen production
ID PH RANGE; ELECTROCATALYSTS; EVOLUTION
AB Electrolysis of abundant seawater resources is a promising approach for hydrogen production. However, the high-concentration chloride ion in seawater readily induces the chlorine evolution reaction (CER), resulting in catalyst degradation and decreased electrolysis efficiency. In recent years, the electrooxidation of small organic molecules (e.g., methanol), biomass-derived compounds (e.g., 5-hydroxymethylfurfural), and plastic monomers (e.g., ethylene glycol) has been seen to occur at lower potentials to substitute for the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CER. This alternative approach not only significantly reduces energy consumption for hydrogen production but also generates value-added products at the anode. This review provides a comprehensive summary of research advancements in value-added electrooxidation reaction-assisted seawater hydrogen production technologies and emphasizes the underlying principles of various reactions and catalyst design methodologies. Finally, the current challenges in this field and potential future research directions are systematically discussed.

AB Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is a significant pathogen responsible for bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and reproductive disorders. Despite its importance, genomic studies of BPIV3 in abortion samples are currently lacking. We detected a BPIV3-positive sample via PCR in the lung sample from an aborted Holstein fetus; therefore, this study aimed to isolate and identify a BPIV3 strain from the aborted fetus sample of Holstein and analyze its genome. We successfully isolated and obtained a BPIV3 strain using MDBK cell lines, named LC1. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genome sequences revealed that the LC1 strain belongs to genotype C and clusters into a branch with the Chinese strain SD2020. Notably, unique amino acid mutations were identified in the P (I297T) and M (P5N) proteins of the LC1 strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BPIV3 genotype C strain to be isolated from a bovine abortion sample, as well as the first characterization of the abortion source BPIV3 genome reported. This finding lays the foundation for further studies on the genetic diversity of BPIV3.

AB 1. In the plant community with a shrub-grass mosaic, the main types of litter include herbaceous litter and its mixed forms with shrub leaves and stems. However, the quantitative relationship between the litter composition type and the litter decomposition, as well as how these processes are influenced by grazing activities (e.g. excrement deposition), remains largely unexplored. 2. Herein, a three-year litter incubation experiment was conducted in a shrub-encroached alpine meadow. We aimed to elucidate the individual and interactive effects of litter type (solely grass litter (L), a mixture of grass litter and shrub leaves (L1) and a mixture of grass litter, shrub leaves and shrub stems (L2)) and yak excrement addition (no addition, addition of dung only, addition of urine only, addition of both dung and urine) on the litter decomposition rate and nutrients release. Additionally, the initial chemical quality of litter, soil microclimate, soil nutrients and soil microbial attributes were analysed to ascertain the underlying driving mechanisms. 3. We found that litter type and yak excrement had significant individual and interactive effects on litter decomposition. Specifically, litter type primarily affected litter decomposition by increasing initial carbon and lignin concentration and reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the litter. In contrast, yak excrement positively impacted litter decomposition through enhancing soil pH and soil microbial activity. Crucially, low-quality litter (L2) mitigated the positive effects of yak excrement on litter decomposition. While the addition of yak excrement did not alter the overall direction of litter decomposition, it influenced the magnitude of the effects caused by litter mixing. Notably, temporary nitrogen immobilization was observed during the early stages of decomposition, and net phosphorus release patterns were evident throughout the decomposition process. However, the duration of nitrogen immobilization differed depending on the litter type and yak excrement treatment. 4. Our findings provide localized evidences that elucidate the interactive effects of litter type and yak excrement addition on litter decomposition and nutrient release processes. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how grazing activity modulates nutrient cycling in shrub-encroached grassland ecosystems.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a prevalent neurotropic pathogen that establishes lifelong latency in the peripheral nervous system, posing substantial clinical challenges due to its recurrent infections and emerging drug resistance. Rohdea chinensis (Baker) N. Tanaka, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been historically used for heat-clearing, detoxifying, wind-dampness dispelling, blood-stasis removing, and pain-relieving properties. Despite its common folk use in Leshan, Sichuan Province, for treating herpes simplex infections, the chemical composition and antiviral activity of Rohdea chinensis remain largely uninvestigated. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to clarify the chemical composition and antiviral activity of the Rohdea chinensis aqueous extract (RCAE), and preliminarily speculate the possible mechanism of its antiviral effect. Materials and methods: The chemical profile of RCAE was characterized using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS, identifying 9 major compounds. The antiviral effects of RCAE were assessed through in vitro and in vivo models, including direct virucidal assays, HSV-1 adhesion inhibition, and a mouse model of flank scratch HSV-1 infection. Immunomodulatory effects were evaluated by analyzing dendritic cell (DC) maturation, CD8(+) T cell differentiation, and cytokine expression. Additionally, HSV-1 latent reactivation models were established to assess RCAE's impact on viral persistence in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Molecular docking studies were conducted to determine potential interactions between RCAE bioactive compounds and HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD). Results: The overall anti-HSV-1 effect of RCAE on Vero cells was determined and the EC50 value was 7.994 mu g/mL. RCAE directly killed HSV-1 and inhibited HSV-1 adhesion in vitro (P < 0.001, 30 mu g/mL RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group), and alleviated viral infection and inflammation of the skin involving the NF-kappa B pathway (P < 0.001, different doses of RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group), as well as anti-viral infection of the brain and DRG in HSV-1-induced mice (P < 0.05, 0.6 g/mL RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group). Interestingly, RCAE played an antiviral role by increasing the maturation of DC in mice, enhancing the antigen presentation ability of DC, promoting the differentiation of CD8(+)T cells and the secretion of CXCL1 and IFN-gamma, and inhibiting the immune escape of HSV-1 virus (P < 0.05, 0.6 g/mL RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group). Besides, RCAE prevented the reactivation of HSV-1 in vitro (P < 0.001, 0.6 g/mL RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group). HSV gD is a critical viral glycoprotein that plays a central role in viral attachment to host cells, intercellular spread, and entry into host cells. To clarify the anti-HSV-1 mechanism of RCAE, molecular docking was employed to preliminarily confirm stable interactions between RCAE compounds (notably compound 9, with a binding energy of -10.5 kcal/mol) and HSV-1 gD. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that RCAE reduced the expression of gD gene (P < 0.001, different doses of RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group) and protein in skin tissues of HSV-1-infected mice, as well as the gD mRNA levels (P < 0.001, different doses of RCAE treated groups vs HSV-1 group) in HSV-1-treated HaCaT cells. These findings suggest that the anti-HSV-1 effect of RCAE may be associated with the inhibition of gD function.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that RCAE has multi-target antiviral effects, including direct virus-killing activity, inhibition of viral replication, immune regulation, and inhibition of latent reactivation of HSV-1 in preclinical models. Integrating traditional Chinese medicine principles (heat-clearing, detoxifying, and blood-stasis-removing properties) with modern pharmacological activities (antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects), RCAE demonstrates potential as a natural product candidate for addressing HSV-1 infection. Given RCAE's complex and undefined composition, future studies are needed to identify key antiviral components and their in vivo efficacy and mechanisms.

AB Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the leading cause of acute liver failure (ALF), driven biological processes such as oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction High-density lipoproteins (HDL), a natural nanoparticle that could deliver HDL cholesteryl ester into hepatocytes via class B type I scavenger receptors (SR-BI), have shown the potential as drug delivery systems for therapeutic applications. In this study, silybin (SIL) was encapsulated in biomimetic synthetic nanoparticles (SIL-HDL), and its therapeutic efficacy against DILI was evaluated. SIL-HDL exhibited a small and uniform particle size, stable physicochemical properties, and enhanced cellular uptake in vitro, as well as improved liver targeting in vivo. Additionally, SIL-HDL enhanced the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of SIL. SIL-HDL improved liver function and inhibited liver necrosis, demonstrating protective effects against DILI. Western blot analysis indicated that the SIL-HDL significantly influenced AMPK/JNK and Nrf2/KEAP1 signaling pathways. These findings suggest that SIL-HDL enhances the therapeutic efficacy of SIL, and it is a promising candidate for treating acetaminophen (APAP)-induced DILI.

AB BackgroundBovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a major pathogen of bovine respiratory disease, causing respiratory and enteric infections in cattle and wild ruminants. It is responsible for economic losses and threatens the health and welfare of cattle industry.ResultsIn this study, a BCoV isolate, BCoV/SUWN/XHD-5, had cytopathogenic effects in Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and showed a high viral titer at 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi). Gene expression profiling using RNA sequencing and protein network mapping using the Tandem Mass Tag-based quantitative proteomics approach were performed in MDBK cells with BCoV infection at 24 and 48 hpi, respectively. Compared with mock-infected MDBK cells, 8,720 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 296 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in BCoV infection at 24 hpi, whereas 5,838 DEGs and 747 DEPs were identified in BCoV infection at 48 hpi. Following GO annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis, most DEGs and DEPs were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, endocytosis, ribosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, apoptosis and immune response. A correlation analysis of the proteome and transcriptome revealed that the up-regulated DEGs and DEPs were predominantly associated with metabolic pathways, apoptosis and the MAPK/TNF/Ras signaling pathway, whereas the down-regulated DEGs and DEPs were involved in complement and coagulation cascades and the Wnt signaling pathway. Importantly, BCoV decreases the mRNA and protein levels of complement component C3 in MDBK cells.ConclusionsThe findings of this study provide the first report of the integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of BCoV infection in MDBK cells. It revealed a regulatory network for analyzing the mechanisms of BCoV-host interactions and provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of BCoV.

AB The beneficial element silicon (Si) plays a crucial role in mitigating salt stress in plants and can activate intracellular signal transduction pathways that reprogram the transcriptome of salt-stressed plants. However, the mechanisms by which plants perceive Si nutrition, induce the expression of Si-responsive genes, and regulate the activity of Si-responsive proteins remain inadequately understood. In this study, we found that Si enhances cell wall integrity by increasing the degree of pectin methyl-esterification and changing the cellulose microfibril arrangement and functions as a regulatory switch for the activities of cell wall integrity sensors (FER homologs OsFLR1 and OsFLR2) during rice plant adaptation to high salinity. Furthermore, the inhibition of OsFLR1 and OsFLR2 through FER-specific inhibitors could negate the beneficial effects of Si and affect the uptake and accumulation of Si in rice seedlings. In conclusion, these findings suggest that Si signaling initiation involves FER-mediated cell wall integrity signaling pathways during salt stress adaptation in rice.

AB Bacterial infections of avian embryos can lead to an increase in embryo mortality, and the proliferation of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria aggravates the situation. A low hatching rate also poses a challenge to the population of artificially bred Crested Ibises (Nipponia nippon). This study aims to determine the potential association between bacterial infection and the death of Crested Ibis embryos, and whether there is convergence between antimicrobial resistance and virulence in strain. In this study, 13 Escherichia coli and 12 Proteus mirabilis isolates were recovered from dead Crested Ibis embryos. The pathogenicity examination confirmed the pathogenicity of all isolates, and multiple virulence genes detected by PCR-sequencing demonstrated the presence of irp2 and iucD (100%), fimC and iss (92.31%) in E. coli, and ucaA (58.33%) in P. mirabilis. Antimicrobial susceptibility test demonstrated that isolates were mainly resistant to amoxicillin (E. coli: 76.92%, P. mirabilis: 91.67%), cefazolin (E. coli: 76.92%, P. mirabilis: 91.67%), oxytetracycline (E. coli: 92.31%, P. mirabilis: 75.00%) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (E. coli: 53.85%, P. mirabilis: 33.33%), and more than 30% of isolates showed multidrug-resistance (MDR). Further analyses detected extended-spectrum J3-lactamase (ESBL) genes, of which blaTEM-1 (E. coli: 100%, P. mirabilis: 100%) had the highest frequency, followed by the blaCTX-M-55 (E. coli: 92.31%, P. mirabilis: 50%), blaCTX-M-14 (E. coli: 76.92%, P. mirabilis: 33.33%), blaCTX-M-65 (E. coli: 15.38%, P. mirabilis: 16.67%), and all isolates were negative for blaSHV and blaOXA. Pearson's correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the presence of J3-lactam resistance and ESBL genes, while mainly negative correlations were observed between the presence of ESBL genes and virulence genes. Furthermore, the conjugation experiment and PFGE revealed that the isolates were primarily polyclonal, and there was horizontal transfer of resistance or virulence genes by plasmids. Based on the results, E. coli and P. mirabilis were responsible for embryonic mortality of the ibises in this study. The co-presence and co-transfer of ESBL genes and virulence genes can pose a potential threat to the health of the Crested Ibis, and measures such as prudent use of antimicrobials, and constant surveillance of resistance and pathogenicity, must be implemented at the Crested Ibis breeding base.

AB China's burgeoning animal husbandry sector has witnessed a notable expansion in goose farming. Among the various health challenges, a novel goose astrovirus (GoAstV) has emerged as a significant threat to the industry, necessitating prompt detection strategies to mitigate its economic impact. This research introduces a novel detection approach using real-time fluorescence-based reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA), offering a rapid and reliable method for GoAstV identification. We meticulously designed specific primers and probes, and optimized the RT-RAA reaction conditions. The assay's specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and clinical efficacy were rigorously assessed. Our method achieves detection within a swift 26-min window at a constant temperature of 39.00 degrees C, boasting a detection threshold as low as 1.19 x 10(2 )copies per mu L. Notably, the assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with closely related viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus H9 subtype, goose circovirus, goose parvovirus, duck Tembusu virus, and avian adenovirus type 4. Validation through testing of 40 clinical samples confirmed a 100% agreement with pre-existing data. The study's outcomes underscore the high specificity, sensitivity, and operational simplicity of the developed RT-RAA assay, positioning it as an ideal candidate for the rapid and on-site detection of GoAstV.

ID RED WINES; VOLATILE; PROFILES; FLAVOR
AB The study explores the effect of pre-fermentation heat treatment (PFHT) on the flavor and metabolomic profiles of kiwi wine (KW) derived from three kiwifruit cultivars. Six KW groups were involved, namely with/without PFHT for green (GWH/GW), yellow (YWH/YW), and red (RWH/RW) kiwifruit. E-tongue analysis effectively distinguished the taste profiles across these KW groups, identifying significant variations. A total of 97 volatile components were characterized using GC-MS and GC-IMS, 12 of them were identified as key volatile compounds based on a combination of t-tests (p < 0.05) and variable importance in projection (VIP) scores. GC-MS and GC-IMS results demonstrated that PFHT significantly altered volatile profiles, specifically decreasing ester content while increasing aldehyde levels in comparison to untreated samples. Furthermore, 71 non-volatile compounds were identified by 1H-NMR, with 10 key metabolites (p < 0.05, VIP > 1) contributing to the observed differences. PFHT notably influenced metabolomic profiles, particularly in carbohydrate and organic acid levels, displaying cultivar-specific differences. Green kiwifruit-derived KW showed the most pronounced sensitivity to PFHT, as reflected in both flavor and metabolic profiles. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing KW production processes and scaling up industrial production.

AB Efficient adsorbents with versatility, stability, and superadsorption are crucial for wastewater treatment. Here, a cotton cellulose/poly(acrylic acid)@laponite (CA@Lap) hydrogel for treating multiple cationic dyes is developed by a cooperative optimization strategy. Incorporating cotton cellulose dissolution system and cooperative crosslinking of laponite in reticular frameworks of polymer significantly enhances morphology, mechanical strength, and adsorption capabilities of CA@Lap. The hydrogel can adsorb crystal violet (CV), methylene blue (MB), and malachite green (MG) over a wide pH range (2-11), achieving about 95 % adsorption within 5 min. The adsorption capacities (qe,CV = 2245.7 mg/g, qe,MB = 3840.8 mg/g, qe,MG = 12,160.9 mg/g) surpass those of previous adsorbents. Mechanisms show that CV and MB adsorption is monolayer chemisorption, while MG adsorption involves multilayer chemisorption or physisorption. Changes in FT-IR and XPS spectra confirm hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction between the functional groups and dye molecules, supported by DFT calculations. The excellent mechanical properties (4.07 MPa) and strong interactions ensure adsorption stability after 5 cycles, maintaining high adsorption capacity and removal efficiency (above 90 %) in real wastewater and fixed bed experiments. Such efficient CA@Lap adsorbents prepared by cooperative optimization strategy can provide valuable insights to address the limitations of cellulose-based hydrogels for water treatments.

In this sensing system, highly specific toehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD) was combined using the technique of indirect DNA immobilization by capture DNA, which prevents non-specific DNA adsorption on the GO, to provide an excellent reaction efficiency of CHA for one-pot. This new method is general and has been successfully applied for the selective detection of miRNA-21, adenosine and thrombin with detection limits of 0.66 pM, 1.2 mu M and 0.14 nM respectively, demonstrating its great application prospects for biomolecular recognition in diagnostic analysis.

AB Vegetarian practices have historically been ingrained in Chinese society. However, it is uncertain to what extent these practices correspond to the global concept of a sustainable diet. In this study, we aimed to identify popular vegetarian dietary patterns in China based on the most-viewed online recipes and evaluate their associated food preferences and sustainability characteristics. The results indicated the following: (1) Chinese and Western vegetarian diets differ greatly in their food preferences for starchy staples, fruits, and dairy products. Popular Chinese vegetarian diets are characterized by high grain consumption and low intake of salt and added sugars. (2) Popular Chinese vegetarian diets are rich in vitamin E (32.37-37.36 mg/d), phosphorus (1172.80-1267.20 mg/d), copper (2.21-2.56 mg/d), and manganese (5.89-6.96 mg/d), yet deficient in vitamin A (421.03-565.65 mu g RE/d), calcium (438.91-693.36 mg/d), and selenium (28.06-36.90 mg/d). Additionally, there is a risk of inadequate riboflavin intake within a vegan dietary pattern. (3) Compared with Chinese omnivorous diets and Western vegetarian diets, at the 2,000 kcal/d level, popular Chinese vegetarian diets have a lower environmental footprint in terms of land use (3.44-5.95 m2), greenhouse gas emissions (1.76-2.74 kgCO2eq), and freshwater withdrawals (510.87-678.34 L). Our findings serve as a valuable reference for promoting healthy dietary choices worldwide and advancing sustainable development goals related to food security and environmental conservation.

AB The skeletal muscle, one of the largest tissues in mammals, plays a crucial role in maintaining body movement and energy metabolism. Dysfunction or damage to the skeletal muscle can lead to various muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia, and others. The myofiber presents the fundamental structural unit of the skeletal muscle, and research on its structure and biological function is of great significance. Here, we review the latest progress in the structural and functional aspects of the myofiber, focusing on myofibril, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the cytoskeleton. The basic properties and dynamic interactions of a large number of muscle proteins have been described in detail, including the scaffold construction of core protein components and the fine-tuning of secondary protein components with functional redundancy. This overview provides new insights into skeletal muscle pathophysiology.

AB Feline coronavirus (FCoV) poses a significant threat to the lives of cats, and there is currently no commercial vaccines available. In the present study, a vaccine was developed using a human type 5 adenovirus vector to express the FCoV-I S protein (rAd5-FCoV-S) to induce the immunogenicity of rAd5-FCoV-S through oral and intramuscular immunization in mice and cats. Both vaccination methods stimulated a higher IgG antibody response. However, oral vaccination led to a significantly higher SIgA antibody level, which was 4.8 times and 2.4 times greater than that induced by intramuscular vaccination in mice and cats, respectively, with the highest level reaching 1:128. In addition, oral vaccination increased the count of IFN-gamma-producing and IL-4-producing splenocytes in mice, effectively boosting cellular immune responses. Challenge protection experiments in cats showed that oral vaccination with rAd5-FCoV-S provided 100 % protection compared to a survival rate of only 33 % for unvaccinated cats. Compared to the PBS group, oral rAd5-FCoV-S administration substantially decreased the FCoV viral load within the feces, rectal tissues, and colon tissues of cats. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis of rectal and colonic tissues revealed that cats in the oral group exhibited minimal intestinal damage, whereas PBS cats presented significant inflammatory cell infiltration and shedding of intestinal epithelial cells. These findings demonstrate that oral administration of rAd5-FCoV-S induces a robust humoral immune response and a strong cell-mediated immune response in cats, thereby conferring immunity against FCoV infection.

AB Plant litter plays critical roles in altering biogeochemical processes and ecological functions in global grasslands. However, little is known about how plant litter alterations influence the multiple ecological functions in semi-humid alpine grasslands. A controlled experiment in field was carried out in alpine grassland, where different plant litter inputs levels were conducted to explore how plant litter manipulation affects the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). The results showed that plant litter removal tended to positively affect plant diversity and productivity but negatively affect soil nutrients. In contrast, plant litter addition had a trend to decrease plant diversity and productivity but increase soil nutrients. Both plant litter addition and removal had negative influences on the EMF index in semi-humid alpine grassland. Ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) was significantly decreased under the L+100 % treatment (p < 0.01). However, we found that the above- and belowground ecological functions responded differently to plant litter manipulation. Plant litter addition had negative impacts on the aboveground ecosystem functioning but tended to positively affect the belowground ecosystem functioning. Aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality (AEMF) was significantly decreased under the L+50 % treatment (p < 0.05), while a significant decrease in AEMF was observed under the L+100 % treatment (p < 0.001). However, plant litter removal had a trend to increase the aboveground ecosystem functioning but significantly decreased the belowground ecosystem functioning. Belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (BEMF) was significantly decreased under the L-50 % treatment (p < 0.05), while a significant decrease in BEMF was observed under the L-100 % treatment (p < 0.001). In addition, the finding revealed that plant litter manipulation affected the ecosystem multiple functioning directly through regulating plant diversity and productivity as well as soil fertility. These results emphasize the significant role of climate change and grazing induced alterations in plant litter inputs in maintaining the ecological functions in alpine grasslands and indicate that such changes in litter inputs may alter the relative contribution of plant diversity to ecosystem functioning by mediating plant productivity and soil nutrient cycling.

AB This study aimed to explore the influence of glutathione-enriched inactive dry yeast (g-IDY) addition on the changes in aroma and taste compounds in kiwi wine (KW), produced from green-, red-, and yellow-flesh kiwifruits. In total, 42 aroma compounds and 67 taste compounds were characterized using GC-IMS and 1H-NMR, respectively. Among them, six aroma compounds and thirty-one taste compounds were determined as key compounds based on a t-test, variable importance in projection scores, and relative odor activity value. Results indicated that g-IDY addition significantly decreased the concentration of hexyl acetate and increased the concentrations of 1-hexanol-M and pentanal in KW produced from green- and yellow-flesh kiwifruits. Pearson correlation analysis revealed strong associations between key aroma and taste compounds, particularly highlighting significant negative correlations between amino acids and aroma compounds. The findings could shed light on KW processing optimization and provide theoretical support for integrating g-IDY into KW industrial production.

ID PATHWAY
AB Background: Ammonia (NH3), a harmful gas, reduces livestock productivity, threatens their health, and causes economic losses. Luteolin (Lut), an anti-inflammatory flavonoid, may counteract these effects. Methods: Our study explored luteolin's protective mechanisms on chicken splenic lymphocytes under ammonia stress using a simulation model and four-dimensional fast data-independent acquisition (4D-FastDIA) proteomics. We identified 316 proteins, with 69 related to ammonia's negative effects and 247 to Lut's protection. Thirty differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were common to both groups, with 27 showing counter-regulation with Lut. Results: Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed DEPs enriched in molecular responses to interferons and the negative regulation of immune responses, mainly located extracellularly. Molecular function analysis revealed DEPs in antigen binding and synthase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis linked DEPs to pathways like estrogen signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results indicated that the mRNA levels of Interferon Alpha and Beta Receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) were trending downward. This observation was in strong agreement with the downregulation noted in the proteomics analysis. Conclusions: Lut's protective role against ammonia's adverse effects on chicken splenic lymphocytes is linked to the modulation of key signaling pathways, offering insights for further research on treating ammonia exposure with Lut.

AB The yak (Bos grunniens), the only large domesticated species endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is a vital resource for local livelihoods and regional economic sustainability. However, yak breeding faces significant challenges, including limited understanding of the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits, inadequate advanced breeding strategies, and the sterility of hybrid offspring from yak-cattle crosses. These constraints have hindered genetic progress in key production traits. To address these issues, integrating modern genomic tools into yak breeding programs is imperative. This review explores the application and potential of molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic prediction (GP) in yak genetic improvement. We systematically evaluate critical components of genomic breeding pipelines, including: (1) phenotypic trait assessment, (2) sample collection strategies, (3) reference population design, (4) high-throughput genotyping (via genome sequencing and SNP arrays), (5) predictive model development, and (6) heritability estimation. By synthesizing current advances and methodologies, this work aims to provide a framework for leveraging genomic technologies to enhance breeding efficiency, preserve genetic diversity, and accelerate genetic gains in yak populations.

AB China contains Asia's largest wetlands, which include diverse wetland types, e.g., peatlands, marshes and mangroves; these wetlands are found from inland to coastal regions. Over the past four decades, considerable amounts of natural wetlands have been drained, thus severely decreasing their carbon (C) sequestration ability. Recent rewetting has been initiated to restore wetland ecosystem services and mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the magnitudes, patterns, controls and mitigation potentials of annual net ecosystem C balances (NECB) have not been adequately studied, leading to large uncertainties in predicting wetland C cycles under climate change and anthropogenic activities across different wetlands in China. These influencing factors include the combinations of vertical net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and horizontal C removal through biomass harvest, as well as dissolved organic and inorganic C (DOC and DIC) exports. Here, using the annual measurement of NECB from 148 sites across different wetlands in China, we found that the annual NECB varied widely from -9413 to + 8760 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1); these fluxes were collectively influenced by wetland status, wetland location, and wetland type. Drainage turned natural wetlands from net C sinks to net C sources (p < 0.05), regardless of whether wetlands were inland or coastal, while rewetting significantly (p < 0.05) reversed the net C loss trends from drained wetlands to net C uptake in rewetted wetlands. Coastal wetlands had significantly greater (p < 0.05) annual C uptake than inland wetlands, with coastal mangroves exhibiting the highest uptake rates. Eighty percent of the spatial variations in the annual NECB were explained (p < 0.0001) by the spatial variations in the mean annual temperature (MAT) and water table depth (WTD) across different wetlands in China. Scenario analysis showed that drained wetlands should be rewetted promptly; postponing rewetting causes larger emissions from continued C losses from drained wetlands.

AB Introduction To investigate the correlations among antibiotic resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group, and genetic diversity, providing essential data for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection prevention and control in Tibetan pigs.Methods A total of 244 E. coli isolates were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the microdilution method. PCR was used to detect antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes, and phylogenetic groups. Genetic diversity was analyzed using enterobacterial repetitive element sequence-based PCR. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 5-12, a representative strain with multidrug resistance and strong biofilm-forming ability, harboring abundant virulence genes, was selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to validate PCR results.Results Among the 244 isolates, 84.43% showed multidrug resistance (MDR), with the highest resistance rates for chloramphenicol (99.59%), sulfadiazine (96.31%), and sulfamethoxazole (93.85%). Twenty-five ARGs were detected, with ant(3')-Ia, bla TEM, aac(3')-II, floR, and qnrS exceeding 80% detection rates. Integrase genes intl1 and intl2 were found in 90.16% and 15.16% of isolates, respectively. Seventeen virulence genes were detected; bcsA (98.77%), fimC (89.75%), and agn43 (59.43%) were the most prevalent. A total of 106 virulence patterns were identified, with agn43/bcsA/fimC being predominant (17.92%). Most strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (45.90%), followed by B1 (34.43%), while 29 strains were unclassified. Sixty-four isolates were identified as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), predominantly enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 90.63%). Biofilm-forming ability was categorized as strong (4.69%), moderate (21.88%), weak (59.38%), or absent (14.06%). Clustering based on 61.2% similarity grouped the 64 DEC into five clusters, with 84.38% in cluster II, which contained all strong biofilm producers.Discussion Antimicrobial resistance profiles of EAEC 5-12 confirmed that primarily confer resistance through antibiotic efflux, target alteration, and reduced permeability. These findings will contribute to further understanding the positive correlation between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in E. coli from Tibetan pig farms, shedding light on the rational use of antimicrobial agents and tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis in Tibetan pig breeding in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China.

AB Urbanisation leads to the alteration of the living environment of soil fauna and isolates them, significantly influencing the evolutionary processes of soil fauna. Faunal gut microbiota serves to bridge hosts with changing environments; thus, they are viable indicators of host adaptation. For this study, we investigated how urbanisation affects the gut microbiota and population genetics of Spirobolus bungii. The results revealed that urbanisation did not affect the genetic diversity of S. bungii populations but acted as a barrier, which hindered its gene flow. Genetic differentiation was associated with the compositional similarity of gut microbiota among populations; however, environmental distinctions had no impact. Our findings highlighted that gene flow between populations was a critical factor, which supported the premise that urbanisation influences the gut microbiota compositions of species. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie changes in faunal gut microbiota driven by gene flow in the context of urbanisation.

AB Credit scoring is pivotal in financial risk management and has attracted significant research interest. While existing studies primarily concentrate on enhancing model predictive power and economic value, they often overlook the crucial aspect of predictive uncertainty, especially in the context of deep neural networks applied to credit scoring. This study addresses uncertainty estimation in credit scoring and evaluates three widely used uncertainty methods across various credit datasets. Additionally, guided by the maximum profit criterion, we propose two profit-based uncertainty metrics to assess profit uncertainties stemming from predictive uncertainty, specifically targeting class-dependent and instance-dependent cost scenarios. Subsequently, we develop a classification system with a rejection mechanism based on these metrics. Our approach aims to improve model profitability and reduce predictive uncertainty, specifically regarding model profit. Empirical results across several benchmark credit datasets indicate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of increasing model profit in different credit-scoring scenarios. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of varying cost parameter settings highlight the robustness of our framework.

AB Market competition and industrial environment have a significant impact on firms' innovation behavior. Hence, this study aims to uncover the connection between industry concentration and digital process innovation in Chinese rail transit firms. Grounded in innovation diffusion theory, we explore the effects of industry concentration on digital process innovation and analyze the contingent factors of firm size and environmental support on the above effects. Through empirical analyses of data from Chinese rail transit firms, this study reveals that industry concentration inhibits digital process innovation. Firm size strengthens the negative impacts of industry concentration, while environmental support weakens the main effect. Our findings offer a complementary framework for industry organization activities and practical implications for digital process innovation.

TI Design of a 10 GHz TE01-TE11 mode converter using

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS

DT Article
ID CONVERSION; GYROTRON
AB In a cyclotron system, the output mode is typically the TE0n mode. However, this mode cannot be transmitted over long distances and energy is easily dissipated. It is usually converted to Gaussian mode HE11 through mode conversion for long-distance transmission and application. For circular waveguide TE01-TE11 mode converters, the usual method is to use trigonometric function curves or iterative methods, but these two methods cannot effectively ensure that the input and output are on the same horizontal line. In some specific circumstances, the effectiveness of using these methods will be restricted. The coaxial-parallel mode converter can be effectively designed by researching a new B-spline curve method. Combined with coupled wave equation theory and B-spline curve theory, a working frequency of 10 GHz can be obtained through program design and calculation. For a mode converter with a waveguide radius of 25 mm, the simulation calculation has a conversion efficiency of 99.485%, with the input and output strictly aligned along the same horizontal line.

AB The realization of atomic arrangement at the van der Waals interface is of importance in the exploration of interfacial superconductivity. Here, by epitaxy of Bi2Te3/FeTe heterostructures with different interface qualities, the corresponding atomic images and electron energy loss spectra evidence the relationship between interfacial chemical reaction and interface quality. Interfacial chemical reaction will cause the stoichiometric ratio imbalance of the FeTe layer and produce a large number of interstitial iron-related defects. When FeTe is employed as the growth substrate, it is crucial to maintain stable growth parameters for the Bi2Te3 layer. Conversely, when the Bi2Te3 layer serves as the growth substrate, ensuring a balanced stoichiometric ratio within the Bi2Te3 layer becomes paramount. This approach minimizes the extent of interface reactions and guarantees the stable presence of the superconducting phase at the interface. This work provides insights into the underlying relationship between interface structure and superconductivity in Bi2Te3/FeTe, and it reveals the possible mechanism by which neighboring telluride layers affect the topological superconductivity of FeTe heterostructures.

AB Understanding the aging mechanism of Chinese baijiu is essential for improving both the efficiency and quality. However, existing studies have largely overlooked the comprehensive consideration of external thermal and humidity environments, leaving the mechanisms underlying aging microenvironment formation underexplored. To address this, the present study reviews the research about the aging environment, systematically constructs a knowledge framework, and identifies key challenges in the existing literature. Focusing on the volatile gases produced by the base liquor and their coupling with the temperature and humidity dynamics of the aging environment, this study introduces the innovative concept of "Gas-Thermal-Humidity" microenvironment. The proposed research framework includes: (1) dynamic measurement of key parameters in typical, followed by statistical analysis to identify spatiotemporal distribution patterns and correlations; (2) development of a "Gas-Thermal-Humidity" multiphysical field coupling model with numerical solution methods; and (3) creation of a multiparameter, multidimensional, and multiscale comprehensive evaluation method for the cellar microenvironment. By leveraging engineering thermophysics approaches, this study offers new perspectives and optimization strategies for baijiu production, contributing both significant academic innovation and practical value.

AB This article introduces a novel approach to designing a self-packaged filter array by integrating two bandpass filters (BPFs) onto a substrate integrated suspended line (SISL) platform. The innovative topology employed in this design establishes individual air cavities for each filter circuit, created by layering multiple substrate layers and packaging them with grounded substrates at both ends. All filter input and output ports are situated on the bottom ground plane and are connected to their respective ports via metal pins and a multilayer substrate. To address impedance-matching challenges and mitigate parasitic effects resulting from the metal pin connections, strategic impedance-matching techniques are implemented at the pin-to-microstrip line junctions. Furthermore, vertical interconnect access (VIA) structures are strategically positioned around the periphery of the air cavities, linking the ground planes of all substrate layers. This design innovation reduces the number of air cavities by two compared to conventional SISL structures, effectively minimizing volume and shortening connection pin lengths, thereby simplifying the impedance-matching process. The design achieves a quad-flat no-leads (QFN) packaging style by encapsulating each filter circuit with a multilayer substrate containing ground planes, VIAs, and top and bottom ground layers. Validation of the proposed packaging design concept is conducted experimentally through the measurement of two BPFs, with results indicating that the proposed packaging mode enhances filter performance, particularly in terms of reducing losses.

AB BackgroundFungi in tumors act as a double-edged sword, potentially worsening or alleviating malignancy based on the ecological balance within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Hydrogels, as innovative drug delivery systems, are poised to redefine treatment paradigms. As advanced biomaterials, they offer a versatile platform for encapsulating and releasing antifungal agents and immunomodulators, responding to the TME's unique demands.MethodsWe have conducted and collated numerous relevant reviews and studies in recent years from three aspects: Hydrogels, intra-tumoral fungi, and tumor microbe microenvironment, in the hope of identifying the connections between hydrogels and intra-tumoral microbes.ResultsThis review underscores the crucial role of intra-tumoral microbes, particularly fungi, in tumorigenesis, progression, and treatment efficacy. At the same time, we concentrated on the findings of hydrogels investigations, with their remarkable adaptability to the tumor microenvironment emerge as intelligent drug delivery systems.ConclusionsHydrogels unique ability to precisely target and modulate the tumor microflora, including fungi, endows them with a significant edge in enhancing treatment efficacy. This innovative approach not only holds great promise for improving cancer therapy outcomes but also paves the way for developing novel strategies to control metastasis and prevent cancer recurrence.

AB Introduction Short-term memory poses a significant challenge, involving complex processes of image perception, memory formation, and execution. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation, storage, and execution of short-term memory remain poorly understood.Methods In this study, 41 healthy college students participated in a memory challenge test designed to investigate these processes. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to measure dynamic changes in hemoglobin concentrations in specific cortical regions, while facial expressions and vital signs were recorded in real-time during the tests.Results The results revealed heightened activity in the inferior prefrontal gyrus, visual association cortex, pre-motor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex. Functional connectivity between these regions was significantly enhanced during the tasks, and inter-group differences decreased over time. Participants with superior short-term memory exhibited lower levels of negative emotional expressions and higher heart rates compared to those with weaker memory performance. These findings suggest that cortical interconnectivity and adequate cerebral blood oxygenation play critical roles in enhancing short-term memory capacity. This has important implications for education, as it highlights strategies for cultivating attention, training memory skills, and improving memory integration abilities.

AB The effects of wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGH) preculture on yeast acetic acid tolerance and fermentation performances were investigated. Results showed that WGH preculture significantly increased yeast growth and viability under acetic acid stress. Particularly, the WGH fraction precipitated with 90 % (v/v) gradient ethanol (WGH-C) preculture significantly improved yeast cell membrane integrity and H+-ATPase activity, thereby decreasing the intracellular accumulation of ROS and acetic acid. Meanwhile, WGH-C preculture promoted the ethanol production efficiency, shortening the fermentation lag time by 12 h and increasing the ethanol yield by 37.46 %. These improvements were attributed to that WGH-C preculture regulated intracellular amino acid composition and transport protein related gene expression of yeast. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that the cell wall and plasma membrane structures were remodeled, reducing the oxidative stress induced by acetic acid. Furthermore, regulation of energy metabolism and transporter activity are prime mechanisms in improving acetic acid tolerance and fermentation efficiency of yeast.

AB Introduction To explore the impact of different breathing patterns on brain connectivity and emotional states.Methods We recruited 31 participants with an average age of 19 years. They were instructed to perform controlled breathing, including calm, shallow, deep, and alternating deep and shallow breathing patterns. We employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate disparities in the effects of multiple breathing patterns on the brain. Meanwhile, we captured the participants' facial expressions and vital signs.Results There were significant variations in the effects of four breathing patterns on functional connectivity between brain regions, facial expressions, and vital signs. The four breathing patterns impacted six brain regions. Among them, alternating deep and shallow breathing had a particularly pronounced effect, and there was robust functional connectivity in different brain regions. Additionally, this breathing pattern elevated autonomic nervous system activity, which contributed to achieving a more tranquil state. Furthermore, alternating deep and shallow breathing had a more positive influence on the changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentration (Delta [HbO2]) of the brain compared with deep breathing.Discussion Alternating shallow and deep breathing could enhance emotional stability, improve autonomic nervous system function, and promote brain functional connectivity. Our findings unveiled distinct effects of diverse breathing patterns on both the brain and mood state, establishing a theoretical foundation for respiratory rehabilitation training for stroke patients.

AB The molecules containing the indolocarbazoles motif have attracted significant attention over the years, owing to the diverse implication of indolocarbazoles scaffolds in medicinal chemistry, photoelectronic materials and chromophores. In this work, the cobalt-catalyzed intramolecular oxidative cyclization of biindolnaphthoquinones under ligand-free conditions for the synthesis of indolocarbazoles has been developed. The synthesized products were evaluated on the photophysical properties and exhibited interesting fluorescence properties, which is promising for fluorescent probes. Each compound showed a colorimetric response upon addition of CF3COOH in contrast to other acids and the colorimetric sensors are even better, as the signaling event can be detected by the naked eye itself. Performed density functional theory (DFT) calculation helped to estimate quantum chemical reactivity parameters including electronic structure and reactivity of the synthesized compounds.

AB This study examined the inhibitory effects of Iturin A on food spoilage yeasts and tried to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of its action. Four yeast strains-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kluyveri, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Cyberlindnera fabianii-were evaluated through inhibition zone diameters, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum fungicidal concentration. Iturin A effectively inhibited all four strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum fungicidal concentration of 0.03 and 0.06 g/L, 0.06 and 0.125 g/L, 0.125 and 0.50 g/L, and 0.125 and 0.25 g/L, respectively. Cell permeability assays demonstrated that Iturin A increased membrane permeability, resulting in nucleic acid and protein leakage. Scanning electron microscopy altered cell morphology, suggesting membrane damage following Iturin A treatment. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis indicated that Iturin A exerts its antifungal effects through multiple mechanisms, including disruption of fatty acid and phospholipid profiles in the cell membrane, impairment of ion channels, and cell wall disruption via inhibition of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule synthesis. Additionally, Iturin A induced DNA damage, which prompted S. cerevisiae cells to enhance uridine 5 '-diphosphate synthesis, promote cell wall and DNA synthesis, elevate DNA methylation, activate purine salvage pathway, promote DNA repair, and strengthen the tricarboxylic acid cycle to enhance energy production. These findings offer novel insights into the antifungal mechanisms of Iturin A and underscore its potential for controlling food spoilage.

AB Enterobacter strains face limitations in scalable production. This study aimed to enhance fucose-containing exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis via UV mutagenesis and fermentation optimization. A high-yield mutant (Enterobacter sp. 915) was selected via UV irradiation, producing 55.93 % higher EPS yield (0.368 g/L) compared to the wild type. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize medium components and culture conditions. The optimal parameters were maltose (194.71 g/L), malt extract (108.18 g/L), and shaking speed (160 rpm), which increased EPS production to 2.304 g/L, a 74 % improvement. Structural analysis indicated the purified EPS (5.98 kDa) comprised fucose, galactose, glucose, and mannose in a ratio of 3.4:42.2:18.4:13, with alpha-glycosidic linkages and amorphous crystallinity. Thermal analysis showed stability up to 482.8 degrees C, indicating the potential for industrial processing. The EPS also demonstrated significant moisture retention (81 % RH: 24 h absorption rate >50 %) and antioxidant activities, including DPPH (34.33 %), hydroxyl (48.1 %), and ABTS(+) (50.27 %) radical scavenging at 3.2 mg/mL. These properties were comparable to those of commercial fucose-containing EPS, demonstrating its potential as a natural antioxidant and humectant in food applications.

AB Public health emergencies (PHEs) pose significant threats to human health, economic growth and social stability. Network has been regarded as an effective way of dealing with emergencies. Based on the comparative study of multiple cases, this study examined the performance of PHE response network from a three-dimensional perspective of network nodes, node relationships and network structure, and then discussed the reasons affecting the performance of emergency network and finally proposed performance improvement strategies from the perspective of crisis learning. Cases of Beijing's response to SARS in 2003, Shanghai's response to H1N1 in 2009, and Wuhan's response to COVID-19 in 2020 are selected for multi-case comparative study, and social network analysis (SNA) was employed to evaluate the performance of emergency network. The results of this study indicate that there exists is a gap between the actual performance of the emergency network and the target performance set by the planned network. The position of actors, the closeness of actor relationships, and the type of network structure are crucial reasons for this gap. These findings suggest to develop closed-loop emergency network performance improvement strategies: (1) establishing effective response networks through dynamic adjustment of emergency plans; (2) fostering organizational cooperation through open communication, especially strengthen the interactions between governments and NGOs; (3) improving the adaptability of emergency behavior and strengthening the cross-sector dissemination of crisis knowledge through systematic drill training.

AB This paper addresses the issue of exponential stability for discrete-time switched neural networks (DSNNs) with time-varying delays. The considered system switches from one mode to another according to the mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT), which is more practical than classical average dwell-time (ADT) switching. Moreover, the specific goal is to use some improved zero equations with unrestricted weight matrices, which are provided to obtain more free variables. In addition, the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) containing some new state-related vectors are proposed under MDADT switching signal, which effectively obviate the appearance for high-order polynomials. Furthermore, an augmented delay-product-type LKF is also established for enhancing the stability conditions of DSNNs. Then, based on the above methods and some classic inequalities, less conservative stability conditions are provided for DSNNs with time-varying delays. Finally, two numerical examples are offered to show the validity of obtained results.

SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS

DE manifold mixup; open-set recognition; synthetic representation; unknown
   signal recognition
AB There are all kinds of unknown and known signals in the actual electromagnetic environment, which hinders the development of practical cognitive radio applications. However, most existing signal recognition models are difficult to discover unknown signals while recognizing known ones. In this paper, a compact manifold mixup feature-based open-set recognition approach (OR-CMMF) is proposed to address the above problem. First, the proposed approach utilizes the center loss to constrain decision boundaries so that it obtains the compact latent signal feature representations and extends the low-confidence feature space. Second, the latent signal feature representations are used to construct synthetic representations as substitutes for unknown categories of signals. Then, these constructed representations can occupy the extended low-confidence space. Finally, the proposed approach applies the distillation loss to adjust the decision boundaries between the known categories signals and the constructed unknown categories substitutes so that it accurately discovers unknown signals. The OR-CMMF approach outperformed other state-of-the-art open-set recognition methods in com prehensive recognition performance and running time, as demonstrated by simulation experiments on two public datasets RML2016.10a and ORACLE.

AB Addressing the escalating global burdens of inflammatory bowel disease and antimicrobial resistance demanded innovative food-based approaches to fortify gut health and suppress pathogens. We introduced a novel edible probiotic, Enterococcus faecalis HY0110, isolated from marine Thunnus thynnus. Through comprehensive in vitro, in vivo, and metabolomic analyses, we demonstrated its superior antibacterial effects compared to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, along with significantly enhanced antioxidant and free-radical scavenging capacities. Notably, elevated acetic acid production strongly correlated with its antimicrobial efficacy (R >= 0.999). HY0110 also exerted antiproliferative effects on HT-29 colorectal cancer cells by attenuating beta-catenin and BCL-2 expression while upregulating pro-apoptotic markers P62 and c-PARP. In a DSS-induced colitis model, HY0110 alleviated inflammation, restored gut microbial homeostasis, and enhanced deterministic processes in community assembly dynamics. Furthermore, fermenting Periplaneta americana powder with HY0110 triggered extensive metabolic remodeling, notably a 668.73-fold rise in astragaloside A, plus increases in L-Leucyl-L-Alanine, S-lactoylglutathione, and 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin A1. These shifts diminished harmful components and amplified essential amino acids and peptides to bolster immune modulation, redox balance, and anti-inflammatory responses. This work established a transformative paradigm for utilizing marine probiotics and novel entomological substrates in functional foods, presenting strategic pathways for precision nutrition and inflammatory disease management.

AB This study systematically investigates the impact of ecological civilization demonstration areas on eco-efficiency, utilizing the difference-in-differences method based on a dataset comprising 114 resource-based cities in China spanning the years 2006 to 2020. The results uncover a pattern where eco-efficiency is observed to be higher in eastern China and lower in western China, with an overall trend exhibiting fluctuating upward movement. Furthermore, the establishment of ecological civilization demonstration areas is found to exert a positive influence on enhancing eco-efficiency, notably via the channel of technological innovation. Additionally, the effects of ecological civilization demonstration areas on eco-efficiency exhibit significant variation across different zones and city characteristics, indicating the presence of divergent features.

AB Soil microbial diversity and community structure play pivotal roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem functions and biogeochemical cycling. However, the patterns and mechanisms of grazing effects on bacterial and fungal diversity remain poorly understood on a broad scale. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis by compiling a comprehensive dataset consisting of 543 paired observations from 48 manipulative grazing experiments in grassland ecosystems. Pooling all data, our results indicated that grazing significantly altered soil bacterial and fungal community structure, almost uniformly decreased beta diversity, and did not change alpha diversity. However, grazing intensity had different effects on bacterial and fungal communities, with more pronounced alterations in the bacterial community. Moreover, bacterial alpha diversity showed a positive response to cattle/yak grazing and short-term grazing (e.g., less than 5 years), while sheep grazing and long-term grazing had negative effects on bacterial and fungal alpha diversity. Model-selection analysis further suggested that changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soil pH, grazing duration, and livestock type jointly regulated the responses of bacterial and fungal diversity and community structure to grazing disturbances. Our findings underscore the divergent responses of soil microbial alpha and beta diversity to grazing in grassland ecosystems. Appropriate livestock selection (e.g., cattle), short grazing duration, and moderate intensity can help to maintain the stability of microbial communities and ecosystem functions. These insights are crucial for establishing precision grazing management strategies, promoting the sustainability of grassland ecosystems.

AB Recently, superpixel segmentation-based hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising methods have attracted increasing attention, since they could obtain the size-adaptive superpixel fiber rather than a cube with fixed spatial size. The superpixel fiber flexibly exploits the local similarity at different scales and leads to significant low-rankness. In this paper, we propose the parallel HSI denoising models which simultaneously consider the local and global low-rankness of the HSI based on superpixel segmentation. In the proposed models, the non-convex but smooth log-determination function is adopted to better characterize the low-rankness of the HSI. We also propose an adaptive weighted strategy to optimize the restored HSI. An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the parallel models. Several experiments verify the superior performance of the proposed approach over other competing methods.

ID EQUATION
AB In order to solve the current lack of rigorous theoretical models in the machine learning process, in this paper the iterative motion process of machine learning is modeled by using quantum dynamic method based on the principles of first-principles thinking. This approach treats the iterative evolution of algorithms as a physical motion process, defines a generalized objective function in the parameter space of machine learning algorithms, and regards the iterative process of machine learning as the process of seeking the optimal value of this generalized objective function. In physical terms, this process corresponds to the system reaching its ground energy state. Since the dynamic equation of a quantum system is the Schr & ouml;dinger equation, we can obtain the quantum dynamic equation that describes the iterative process of machine learning by treating the generalized objective function as the potential energy term in the Schr & ouml;dinger equation. Therefore, machine learning is the process of seeking the ground energy state of the quantum system constrained by a generalized objective function. The quantum dynamic equation for machine learning transforms the iterative process into a time- dependent partial differential equation for precise mathematical representation, enabling the use of physical and mathematical theories to study the iterative process of machine learning. This provides theoretical support for implementing the iterative process of machine learning by using quantum computers. In order to further explain the iterative process of machine learning on classical computers by using quantum dynamic equation, the Wick rotation is used to transform the quantum dynamic equation into a thermodynamic equation, demonstrating the convergence of the time evolution process in machine learning. The system will be transformed into the ground energy state as time approaches infinity. Taylor expansion is used to approximate the generalized objective function, which has no analytical expression in the parameter space. Under the zero-order Taylor approximation of the generalized objective function, the quantum dynamic equation and thermodynamic equation for machine learning degrade into the free-particle equation and diffusion equation, respectively. This result indicates that the most basic dynamic processes during the iteration of machine learning on quantum computers and classical computers are wave packet dispersion and wave packet diffusion, respectively, thereby explaining, from a dynamic perspective, the basic principles of diffusion models that have been successfully utilized in the generative neural networks in recent years. Diffusion models indirectly realize the thermal diffusion process in the parameter space by adding Gaussian noise to and removing Gaussian noise from the image, thereby optimizing the generalized objective function in the parameter space. The diffusion process is the dynamic process in the zero-order approximation of the generalized objective function. Meanwhile, we also use the thermodynamic equation of machine learning to derive the Softmax function and Sigmoid function, which are commonly used in artificial intelligence. These results show that the quantum dynamic method is an effective theoretical approach to studying the iterative process of machine learning, which provides a rigorous mathematical and physical model for studying the iterative process of machine learning on both quantum computers and classical computers.

AB Windows play a crucial role in reducing energy consumption in buildings. In the case of conventional static windows, it is difficult to strike a balance between heating and cooling in winter and summer. Dynamic windows are adjustable but have a complex structure, with high cost and low sensitivity, limiting their suitability in residential buildings. In this study, we propose a novel mechano-chromic energy-saving window that effectively regulates indoor solar radiation heat gain. The proposed structure outperforms existing mechano-chromic windows, achieving significant transmittance modulation with small associated strains, attaining a solar light transmittance modulation of 24.09 % with a strain of 5 %. In a series of experimental tests, the force-induced chromogenic energy-saving window lowered the average indoor air temperature in summer mode by 1.61 degrees C and 4.46 degrees C compared with standard double-pane insulating windows when subjected to strains of 5 % and 10 %, respectively. In winter mode, the associated decrease in temperature is 0.37 degrees C. Tests in summer have established differences in average indoor illuminance of 102 lux and 155 lux for a strain of 5 % and 10 %, respectively. The difference in indoor illuminance for the experimental (mechano-chromic) and control (double pane insulation) groups in winter mode is negligible.

AB Understanding the stabilization of rhombohedral stacking-order and moire superlattices in structural defects produced by exfoliation is of importance towards applications in nanoscale low-dimensional systems and superconductivity. Here we report a statistical investigation of the stabilization-dynamics of rhombohedral ABC stacking-faults within locally-lifted sublattices, fabricated by exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Raman point/mapping spectroscopy applied to several tens of locally-lifted lattice-regions reveal a weak enhancement of the ratio of the integral area of the 2D band-components, namely within the frequency range from similar to 2550 to 2670 cm(-1) (left shoulder) to that from similar to 2670 to 2760 cm(- 1) (right shoulder). A structural transition is demonstrated with HRTEM revealing the coexistence of hexagonal and one-dimensional moire superlattices with periods D-1-2.04 nm, D-2-2.35 nm (coexisting superlattice-periodicities) and D similar to 13 nm in the stacking-fault regions. Interestingly, selective area electron diffraction (SAED) of the latter revealed unusual doubled electron diffraction patterns. Stabilization of micron-scale stacking-faults of crystalline rhombohedral graphite (ABC stacking) was found as an additional transition, when applying the lifting approach to staircase- defects. Comparative investigations performed on commercially available grafoil revealed a different trend, with the presence of a disorder-rich rhombohedral graphitic phase compatible with a defective A|ABAB|BCBC|CACA| A stacking-sequence, analogous to that reported previously in other grafoil samples and in nitrates intercalated graphite.

AB Identifying and segmenting the vitreous and starchy endosperm of maize kernels is essential for texture analysis. However, the complex internal structure of maize kernels presents several challenges. In CT (computed tomography) images, the pixel intensity differences between the vitreous and starchy endosperm regions in maize kernel CT images are not distinct, potentially leading to low segmentation accuracy or oversegmentation. Moreover, the blurred edges between the vitreous and starchy endosperm make segmentation difficult, often resulting in jagged segmentation outcomes. We propose a deep learning-based CT image analysis pipeline to examine the internal structure of maize seeds. First, CT images are acquired using a multislice CT scanner. To improve the efficiency of maize kernel CT imaging, a batch scanning method is used. Individual kernels are accurately segmented from batch-scanned CT images using the Canny algorithm. Second, we modify the conventional architecture for highquality segmentation of the vitreous and starchy endosperm in maize kernels. The conventional U-Net is modified by integrating the CBAM (convolutional block attention module) mechanism in the encoder and the SE (squeezeand-excitation attention) mechanism in the decoder, as well as by using the focal-Tversky loss function instead of the Dice loss, and the boundary smoothing term is weighted as an additional loss term, named CSFTU-Net. The experimental results show that the CSFTU-Net model significantly improves the ability of segmenting vitreous and starchy endosperm. Finally, a segmented mask-based method is proposed to extract phenotype parameters of maize kernel texture, including the volume of the kernel (V), volume of the vitreous endosperm (VV), volume of starchy endosperm (SV), and ratios over their respective total kernel volumes (VV/V and SV/V). The proposed pipeline facilitates the nondestructive quantification of the internal structure of maize kernels, offering valuable insights for maize breeding and processing.

AB The specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) during early embryogenesis initiates the development of the germ cell lineage that ensures the perpetuation of genetic and epigenetic information from parents to offspring. Defects in germ cell development may lead to infertility or birth defects. Historically, our understanding of human PGCs (hPGCs) regulation has primarily been derived from studies in mice, given the ethical restrictions and practical limitations of human embryos at the stage of PGC specification. However, recent studies have increasingly highlighted significant mechanistic differences for PGC development in humans and mice. The past decade has witnessed the establishment of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) as new models for studying hPGC fate specification and differentiation. In this review, we systematically summarize the current hPSC-derived models for hPGCLC induction, and how these studies uncover the regulatory machinery for human germ cell fate specification and differentiation, forming the basis for reconstituting gametogenesis in vitro from hPSCs for clinical applications and disease modeling.

AB While variable regions of immunoglobulins are extensively diversified by V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation in vertebrates, the constant regions immunoglobulin heavy chains also utilize certain mechanisms to produce diversity, including class switch recombination (CSR), subclass differentiation, and alternative expression of the same gene. Many species birds, reptiles, and amphibians express a truncated isoform of immunoglobulin Y (IgY), termed IgY(Delta Fc), which lacks the vCH3 and vCH4 domains. In Anseriformes, IgY(Delta Fc) arises from alternative transcriptional termination sites within the same v gene, whereas in some turtles, intact IgY and IgY(Delta Fc) are encoded by distinct genes. Different from the previously reported IgY(Delta Fc) variants, this study identified a truncated IgY in the snake Elaphe taeniura, characterized by the loss of only a portion of the CH4 domain. Western blotting and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry confirmed that this truncated IgY is generated by post-translational cleavage at N338 within the IgY heavy chain constant (CH) region. Furthermore, both human and snake asparaginyl endopeptidase were shown to cleave snake IgY in vitro. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for the production of shortened IgY forms, demonstrating that the immunoglobulin CH region undergoes diversification through distinct strategies across vertebrates.

AB Background Bopivirus B is an emerging picornavirus that affects goats in China. This study aimed to establish a TaqMan real-time PCR assay for detecting Bopivirus B and conduct a preliminary survey of infection in six goat farms in Sichuan province, China. Specific primers and a probe targeting the 3D gene of Bopivirus B were designed, and the TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay was successfully established following the optimization of reaction conditions and components. A total of 257 goat fecal samples were collected from six farms in Sichuan and tested using the newly developed method. Results The assay demonstrated a linear relationship between 2.73 x 103 and 2.73 x 109 copies/mu L, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.999) and amplification efficiency of 109%. Additionally, the assay exhibited excellent specificity and reproducibility, with a detection limit of 27.3 copies/mu L. The field positive rate of Bopivirus B was 100%, and a higher positive rate was observed in diarrheal fecal samples (33.72%) compared to non-diarrheal fecal samples (12.28%, P < 0.005), suggesting a potential association between Bopivirus B and goat diarrhea, with a widespread prevalence in goats in the Sichuan province. Furthermore, ten complete 3D genes sequences of Bopivirus B were obtained, and phylogenetic analysis showed that all Bopivirus B strains in this study were most closely related to two known Chinese Bopivirus strains based on nucleotide sequences of the 3D gene. Conclusions This study developed a highly specific, repeatable, and sensitive TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay targeting the 3D gene for Bopivirus B detection, offering a valuable tool for the detection and epidemiological investigation of Bopivirus B. The prevalence of Bopivirus B was widespread in goats in China, with a close association observed between Bopivirus B and goat diarrhea.

AB In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with traditional methods, visible light for the photoredox catalysis of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer (SET) process. Therefore, the formation reaction of a C-C bond can be achieved by activating these molecules with visible light, which can effectively modify the structure of these compounds and obtain compounds with multiple structures and functions. At present, this research has become an important research field in organic synthesis. Eosin-Y, a cheap and widely-used organic dye, has been employed as an economically and environmentally friendly substitute for many transition-metal-based photocatalysts. In recent years, it has gained much more attention due to its ease of handling and eco-friendliness, and it has great potential for applications in visible-light-mediated organic synthesis. This article reviews the research results on the formation of carbon-carbon bonds promoted by the organic photocatalyst Eosin-Y under visible light in recent years, and discusses representative examples and their different mechanistic pathways (such as SET, HAT, and energy transfer).

AB Platinum and Gallium Arsenide reaction is a common issue for the stability of Pt-GaAs contacts, where the formation of different alloys during the fabrication and operation degrades the performance of the devices. In this work, we have carried out in situ deposition of Pt on GaAs and InAlGaAs in the focused ion beam machine and carried out annealing in the high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The local strains were then determined using the geometrical phase analysis technique and the various phases were obtained by digital extraction of lattice fringes. They are mainly Pt3InGa and Pt3InGaAl metallic nanoparticles and it is shown that the occupancy of In/Ga sites by Al atoms shrinks the Pt3InGa local lattice. This strong compression of the (001) and (110) atomic plane narrows the dimer row and thus hinders the diffusion of large atoms such as In/Ga. Therefore, the Schottky barrier is stabilized as further chemical reaction of Pt-InGaAs is blocked. The highest degree of electron localization between Pt and Al atoms is further confirmed by electron localization function calculations.

AB The yak, an important livestock mostly living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, has attracted massive attention due to its reproductive specificity. However, the molecular mechanism regulating yak uterine functions remains to be explored. This study utilized transcriptomics to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in yaks across uteruses undergoing the follicular phase (UFP) (n = 3/group), luteal phase (ULP) (n = 3/group), and pregnant phase (UPP) (n = 3/group), aiming to depict and compare their transcriptomic characteristics. For the UFP and ULP groups, 495 DEGs were identified, including 329 upregulated and 166 downregulated DEGs in group ULP compared to UFP. Advanced analysis indicated that these DEGs between UFP and ULP were primary participants in GO items, such as adhesion, cell differentiation, and development, and were significantly enriched in KEGG signaling pathways like arachidonic acid metabolism, retinol metabolism, and cAMP signaling pathways. For the UFP and UPP groups, 353 DEGs were obtained, comprising 198 upregulated and 155 downregulated DEGs in group UPP compared to UFP. Advanced analysis showed that these DEGs between UFP and UPP were mainly related to GO items such as adhesion, binding, and the extracellular region, and were prominently enriched in KEGG signaling pathways like ECM-receptor interaction, the relaxing signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. For the groups ULP and UPP, 1303 DEGs were identified, encompassing 709 upregulated and 594 downregulated DEGs in group UPP compared to ULP. Advanced analysis indicated that these DEGs between ULP and UPP were associated with GO items such as multicellular organismal processes, cell differentiation, and the extracellular region, and mainly gathered in KEGG signaling pathways like signal transduction, cell differentiation, metabolism, and autophagy. These results provide valuable insights into the key biomarkers observable via dynamic changes in the yak uterus and offer a theoretical basis for further studies on yak reproductive mechanisms and improving production performance.

AB BackgroundLaccase CueO, a multicopper oxidase, possesses the capability to degrade phenolic compounds. In prior research, a strain of Escherichia coli named SDB2, isolated from chicken cecum, was found to degrade sinapine (a phenolic constituent of rapeseed meal) through the secretion of laccase CueO. Herein, the cloning, expression, and bioinformatics analysis of the CueO gene derived from E. coli SDB2 are reported.Methods and resultsSequence analysis indicated that SDB2 CueO comprised 1551 bp, 516 amino acids, a putative molecular weight of 56.65 kDa, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.21. BLAST comparisons showed that the CueO protein sequence from E. coli SDB2 exhibited 65-90% identity with CueO from other bacteria. Multiple alignment analysis further confirmed the similarity and identity of SDB2 CueO with CueO from other species, and the amino acids surrounding the Cu-binding sites were highly conserved. A phylogenetic tree demonstrated a close evolutionary relationship between CueO from E. coli and CueO from Citrobacter amalonaticus. The three-dimensional (3D) structural model revealed four copper (Cu)-binding regions. Recombinant CueO was successfully obtained by expressing the CueO gene in E. coli BL21 after isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the similarity of recombinant CueO with native CueO.ConclusionsThese findings established a basis for understanding the characteristics and functions of laccase CueO from E. coli SDB2, paving the way for future research to explore the properties of recombinant CueO and its potential practical applications in optimizing feed resources, such as rapeseed meal, in the feed production industry.

AB To address the interference from non-radioactive components in the environment and achieve efficient identification of mixed nuclide spectra, we propose a novel isotope identification method, LSNet. Experimental results demonstrate that, with comparable parameter counts and computational complexity, LSNet outperforms models such as the Gate-Recurrent-Unit (GRU) across various evaluation metrics. Additionally, LSNet shows significantly higher accuracy in identifying anomalous nuclide spectra compared to other models. Finally, we demonstrate that LSNet effectively identifies mixed nuclides.

TI Enhancing carrier dynamics via phase manipulation of dual-phase
   all-inorganic perovskites for high-performance photodetectors
SO APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS

DT Article

AB Cesium lead bromide perovskites have demonstrated enormous potential in detecting applications, benefitting from their excellent optoelectronic properties and environmental stability. However, their intrinsic properties of photoluminescence intensity and carrier lifetime, key to photodetector performance, are still limited with conventional approaches (e.g., material purification and defect passivation). Here, we propose an efficient ultrasound-assisted growth method to manipulate the crystal phase of all-inorganic perovskites. Morphological, structural, and elemental characteristics of perovskites are comprehensively investigated, confirming the formation of CsPb2Br5-CsPbBr3 dual-phase (DP) perovskites. The fabricated DP perovskites exhibit enhanced carrier dynamics compared to CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs), including over a tenfold increase in photoluminescence intensity and an extended carrier lifetime of 656 ns. Such impressive improvements originate from the repeated radiative recombination introduced by the hierarchical phase of DP perovskites. As a result, the DP perovskite-based photodetector also demonstrates improved photoresponse, including a larger on/off ratio exceeding 103 and a higher detectivity of 1.48 x 1010 Jones, especially in the absence of conventional transporting layers. These results offer strong competitiveness for state-of-the-art perovskite photodetectors and deliver important implications for the widespread use of DP perovskites in assembling high-performance optoelectronic devices.

AB This paper investigates the dynamic event-triggered (ET) sliding mode control (SMC) of Markov jump delayed systems (MJDSs) with partially known transition probabilities. Firstly, a dynamic ET scheme is introduced for the Markov SMC system, and the effect of time delays is considered. In addition, the Razumikhin condition is used to deal with the time delay. Moreover, in the case of a Markov jump system with partially known transition probabilities, using the vertex method, weak infinitesimal generator, and Dynkin's formula, the finite-time boundness (FTB) problem of a class of ET SMC systems with stochastic delay is studied. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the viability of our results.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF), or marbling, is a critical indicator of goat meat quality. Non-coding RNAs play a key role in the formation and deposition of IMF in vertebrates by regulating genes involved in its synthesis, degradation, and transport. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis identifies circular RNAs (circRNAs) as natural "sponges" for microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the precise mechanisms of circRNAs in goat IMF remain poorly understood. In the current study, we utilized existing sequencing data to construct a ceRNA regulatory network associated with intramuscular adipogenesis and fat deposition in goats. Our goal was to elucidate the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of family with sequence similarity 49 member B (FAM49B). Functionally, FAM49B was found to inhibit the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes and to directly interact with miR-27a-5p. Mechanistically, dual-luciferase reporter assays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the interaction between circ0011446 and miR-27a-5p. Circ0011446 enhanced the expression of FAM49B mRNA and protein through post-transcriptional regulation. As a ceRNA, circ0011446 competitively binds miR-27a-5p, preventing miR-27a-5p from degrading FAM49B. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that circ0011446 suppresses goat adipogenic differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes by regulating the expression of the downstream target gene FAM49B through miR-27a-5p sequestration. This study provides a reference for goat meat quality or livestock breeding.

ID INDOOR THERMAL COMFORT
AB Due to massive urbanization and industrialization, modern constructions tend to be designed as technique-dependent, at the cost of high consumption and emissions for indoor environment control such as heating ventilation and air conditioning. Space heating accounts for about 40% of total building energy usage in northern China in winter. This calls for self-reflection and tracing of local traditional architectural wisdom. In this paper, Sibe Traditional Houses were chosen as a typical illustrative example to reveal the building mechanisms behind such local-adaptive traditional constructions. Based on the field investigation in Shifosi Village, a traditional Sibe settlement in Shenyang City, northern China, thermal modeling and indoor heating effects are studied in Sibe Traditional Houses with unique building spatial patterns. The indoor thermal environment is comparatively analyzed for both passive envelope insulation and active heating considerations. Preliminary results indicate that enhancing roof thermal insulation enhancement is the key passive strategy for improving indoor thermal comfort in winter. It also suggests that a space-heating configuration that combines the traditional "kang" with the architectural layout has a more significant effect on the enhancement of indoor thermal comfort in Sibe dwellings. This paper can provide methodological support and an application reference for the improvement of indoor thermal environment of traditional village dwellings.

AB The consumption of an unbalanced diet, such as a high-fat diet, is strongly associated with hyperlipidemia and significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, which are the leading causes of death worldwide. Globally, about 17.9 million people die of cardiovascular disease each year (WHO 2023). Probiotics have emerged as a promising intervention to alleviate hyperlipidemia. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166), isolated from yak yogurt in the Sichuan Tibetan area, on lipid metabolism in the liver and gut microbiota of high-fat-diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The results revealed that the Lactobacillus fermentum 166 (LF-166) treatment reduced the body weight and decreased the blood and liver lipid levels in these mice. Based on the histopathological findings, LF-166 could alleviate liver steatosis and colon injury. Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing of the mice's colonic contents showed that LF-166 reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) value and enhanced the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota. LF-166 regulated hepatic lipid metabolism through the up-regulation of the genes Lxr, Ampk alpha, Fxr, Hsl, and Atgl and the down-regulation of C/ebp alpha and Ppar gamma in the liver; it also regulated intestinal lipid metabolism by up-regulating Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the ileum and down-regulating the expression of the genes Npc1l1, Asbt, and Ibabp. Thus, LF-166 may inhibit hyperlipidemia progression by modulating the expression of key genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, influencing the intestinal microbiota through the liver-gut axis, and regulating systemic lipid metabolism.

AB As urbanization accelerates in developing countries and populations continue to grow, the demand for sustainable urban regeneration becomes increasingly urgent. This study explores how urban regeneration can be integrated with tourism development to promote sustainable and inclusive growth. Using the theory of organic regeneration, this study emphasizes the role of localized, small-scale interventions that enhance the urban environment while boosting tourism appeal. Through field research at the Tianjin Cruise Terminal, this study applies the KANO model to classify user needs and prioritize design interventions based on the needs of various user groups, including tourists, exercisers, anglers, and local residents. By analyzing user group activity frequencies, the study identifies Must-be, One-dimensional, and Attractive needs, and utilizes weight analysis to assess the impacts of different facilities on user satisfaction. This approach ensures that the design guidelines effectively address both essential and value-enhancing features. The findings provide more suitable design guidelines for improving tourism infrastructure, promoting sustainable development, and enhancing the overall urban experience.

TI CodeDoctor: multi-category code review comment generation
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Review comment generation; Multi-category review comments; Exemplars;
   Category-focus attention
AB Code review is an effective software quality assurance activity. However, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring reviewers to carefully review under various categories (e.g., function, refactoring, documentation, etc) to generate review comments. Several approaches have been proposed for automatic review comment generation, although they can generate review comments, they hardly cover all manual review comments. Because most of these approaches simply utilize the information of submitted code and review comments, not fully modeling the features of code review (i.e., ignoring review category, the association of issue snippets and review comments). In this paper, we propose CodeDoctor, an automatic review comment generator with data augmentation and category-aware encoder-decoder to generate multi-category review comments. It consists of three main phases: (1) Data augmentation phase, which classifies review comments and builds review exemplars (i.e., the pairs of issue snippet and its comment) to augment review data by using a large language model (LLM) with prompt engineering and feedback loops; (2) Encoder phase, which encodes the inputs (i.e., review category, diff code and review exemplar) into semantic and token representations; (3) Decoder phase, which designs a category-focused decoder to capture the most relevant information of given category for multi-category review comment generation. Evaluations with five commonly-used and state-of-the-art baselines on two datasets show that CodeDoctor outperforms all baselines, with 1770% higher average BLEU-4, 111% higher average ROUGE-L and 49% higher average F1 than the best baseline. Furthermore, a human evaluation also confirms the significant potential of applying CodeDoctor in practical usage. Our approach can relieve the burden of reviewers by automatically generating multi-category review comments, and helps developers better detect code issues as early as possible, thereby facilitating software development.

AB Both Avena sativa and Avena nuda, which are highly valued for their use in food and fodder, demonstrate considerable potential in the management of saline-alkali soils. This study aimed to establish a foundation for the selection of salt-tolerant oat cultivars by assessing the impact of varying salt concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mmol L-1) on agronomic traits, photosynthetic characteristics, physiological and biochemical properties, and leaf anatomical structures in both covered oat cultivars and naked oat cultivars. The measured parameters indicate the level of salt tolerance in Avena sativa and Avena nuda, which is influenced by both salt concentration and cultivar. Both Avena sativa and Avena nuda demonstrate strong adaptation to mild and moderate salt stress conditions. However, Avena sativa exhibits a significantly greater capacity to withstand severe salt stress compared to Avena nuda. Affinity function analysis ranked the cultivars' salt tolerance as follows: 'Qinghai 444' > 'Mengyan No. 1' > 'Baiyan No. 18' > 'Qingyin No. 3'. These results suggest that the selection of oat cultivars for salinity improvement should be tailored to the specific salinity levels present in different regions.

AB BackgroundTo study the problem of male sterility of cattle-yak and improve the yak crossbreeding, this study obtained the testicular Sertoli cells of yak and cattle-yak and compared the differences in transcriptome levels between the two bovine species. The testicular tissues of 3 healthy male cattle-yaks and 3 F1 generation male yaks were collected at the age of 24 months. The Sertoli cells were isolated after enzymatic digestion, differential adhesion and starvation treatment. DATA-4 and SOX9 immunofluorescence staining were used to identify the cell type. Sertoli cells were subjected to transcriptome sequencing, GO analysis, KEGG analysis and differentially expressed gene were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.ResultsThe study successfully isolated and purified Sertoli cells of yak and cattle-yak. The transcriptome sequencing data were compared, analyzed and annotated. Compared to yak Sertoli cells, 6592 differentially expressed genes were identified, with 3007 genes upregulated and 3585 genes downregulated in cattle-yak Sertoli cells. GO analysis suggested that the upregulated genes might be mainly involved in processes such as translation, peptide biosynthetic process, amide biosynthetic process, peptide metabolic process, ribosome, cytoplasmic part, structural constituent of ribosome, structural molecule activity, endomembrane system, protein kinase activity, and phosphotransferase activity. The downregulated genes appeared to be primarily involved in protein phosphorylation, phosphorylation, endomembrane system, protein kinase activity, and phosphotransferase activity. KEGG analysis compared differential genes across 316 pathways, with 8 pathways showing significant enrichment. The upregulated pathways were potentially enriched in cattle-yak Sertoli cells, including ribosome, thermogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, while the downregulated pathways seemed to be significantly enriched in adherens junction, mTOR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Compared with yak Sertoli cells, ISOC2, RPL27A and FISI were highly expressed in cattle-yak, as confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis. PDPN, SORBS2, TF, PLSCR1, TJP2, KIF2C, ITGA3, SMTNL2, DSP, ADGRG1, DDR1, GSK3A, RBBP6, ZC3H15 and Claudin 11 showed low expression levels in cattle-yak.ConclusionsCompared with yak Sertoli cells, the expression of genes related to protein activation, cell function, and membranous organelle composition in cattle-yak Sertoli cells appeared to be abnormal. The potential defects in cattle-yak Sertoli cells may hinder the creation of a suitable environment for spermatogenesis, which could be one of the factors contributing to male cattle-yak sterility. Claudin-11 might be a potentially important gene for further research into cattle-yak male sterility.

AB Aichivirus D (AiV-D), a newly emerging member of the Kobuvirus genus, is associated with diarrhea in cattle. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of AiV-D among dairy cattle in China. From October 2021 to August 2022, 279 fecal samples were collected from diarrheal dairy cattle across seven provinces in China. Among these, 37 samples (13.2%) tested positive for AiV-D by RT-PCR, indicating a wide geographical distribution of AiV-D in Chinese dairy cattle. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete VP1 gene revealed that Chinese dairy cattle AiV-D strains belong to the AiV-D2 genotype, with unique amino acid changes in VP0, VP3, and VP1 that distinguish them from known AiV-D strains. Additionally, an AiV-D strain was successfully isolated, and its complete genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and individual genes confirmed the strain's classification within the AiV-D2 genotype. This study reports the first detection of the AiV-D2 genotype outside Japan, highlighting the need for future surveillance to better understand the epidemiology and diversity of AiV-D in China.

AB Studies have shown that histidine 179A and 183A (H179, 183A) of the ZNF32 protein exhibit point-like nuclear speckles, but the causes of such speckle formation and their effects on breast cancer cells remain unknown. In this study, we prepared breast cancer cells containing ZNF32 H179, 183A, H179A, and H183A and observed nuclear speckles in all three cell types. Transcriptome analysis showed that these nuclear speckles may be related to changes in the activities of the cell growth factor and RNA polymerase II transcription factor. Comprehensive transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses showed that the formation of ZNF32 nuclear speckles was accompanied by changes in choline metabolism. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments suggested that ZNF32 H179A and H183A but not H179, 183A could promote breast cancer cell proliferations. We then explored and verified the differentially expressed genes through RNA-seq and RT-qPCR to explain the different proliferation abilities of these mutations. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that ZNF32 H179A and H183A could transcriptionally activate ISY1-RAB43 and UPK3BL1 while inhibiting the transcription of SNX22; this is attributable to the fact that these mutations cause different zinc finger structure changes in ZNF32. The present study deepens the understanding of ZNF32 mutations with respect to nuclear speckle formation and their roles in the proliferation of breast cancer cells.

DT Article
DE Error correction; In-field; Three-axis magnetometer
ID MAGNETOMETER CALIBRATION
AB In this study, a novel in-field calibration method with less computation time for calibrating the error of the three-axis magnetometer (TAM) array was proposed. The proposed approach was developed using Gaussian process (GP) regression. The calibration method helped to bypass the mathematical error model of the TAM array and alleviated the model's inadequacy. The method reduced the magnetometer errors and misaligned errors between magnetometers and magnetic interference without other references. The efficacy of the proposed calibration method was first verified by simulations, which illustrated that the maximum peak-peak error of the total magnetic field for all TAMs decreased from the order of 104 nT to less than 1 nT in a complete 360 degrees rotation, and the differences between the three geomagnetic field components of different TAMs reduced from the order of 103 nT to less than 1 nT. In addition, simulations also illustrated that this correction method can effectively improve the locating performance with locating error dropping from 3.34 m to 0.06 m. In-field experimental tests verified the efficacy of the proposed method, and the results yielded a high-accuracy objective performance.

AB BackgroundThermogenic adipose tissue, both beige and brown, experiences whitening as animals are exposed to warmth and age, but the potential mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we employed single-nucleus RNA-seq to construct a cell atlas during whitening progression and identified the characteristics of thermogenic adipocytes.ResultsOur histological studies and bulk transcriptome gene expression analysis confirmed that both perirenal and omental adipose tissues (pAT and oAT) exhibited progressive whitening in goats. Compared to the classic brown adipocytes in mice, goat thermogenic adipocytes were more closely related in gene expression patterns to human beige adipocytes, which was also confirmed by adipocyte type- and lineage-specific marker expression analysis. Furthermore, trajectory analysis revealed beige- and white-like adipocytes deriving from a common origin, coexisting and undergoing the transdifferentiation. In addition, differences in gene expression profiles and cell communication patterns (e.g., FGF and CALCR signaling) between oAT and pAT suggested a lower thermogenic capacity of oAT than that of pAT.ConclusionsWe constructed a cell atlas of goat pAT and oAT and descripted the characteristics of thermogenic adipocytes during whitening progression. Altogether, our results make a significant contribution to the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the whitening of thermogenic adipocytes, and providing new insights into obesity prevention in humans and cold adaptation in animals.

AB BackgroundPeste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is currently the only member of the Morbillivirus caprinae species within the genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyoxviridae. PPRV causes a highly contagious disease in small ruminants, especially goats and sheep. Succinylation is a newly identified and conserved modification and plays an important role in host cell response to pathogen infection. However, the extent and function of succinylation in Vero cells during PPRV infection remains unknown.ResultsIn this study, a global profile of the succinylome in Vero cells infected with PPRV Nigeria 75/1 vaccine strain (PPRVvac) was performed by dimethylation labeling-based quantitative proteomics analysis. A total of 2633 succinylation sites derived from 823 proteins were quantified. The comparative analysis of differentially succinylated sites revealed that 228 down-regulated succinylation sites on 139 proteins and 44 up-regulated succinylation sites on 38 proteins were significantly modified in response to PPRVvac infection, seven succinylation motifs were identified. GO classification indicated that the differentially succinylated proteins (DSuPs) mainly participated in cellular respiration, biosynthetic process and transmembrane transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that DSuPs were related to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein-protein interaction networks of the identified proteins provided further evidence that various ATP synthase subunits and carbon metabolism were modulated by succinylation, while the overlapped proteins between succinylation and acetylation are involved in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.ConclusionsThe findings of the present study provide the first report of the succinylome in Vero cells infected with PPRVvac and provided a foundation for investigating the role of succinylation alone and its overlap with acetylation in response to PPRVvac.

AB The brain is a complex system with multiple scales and hierarchies, making it challenging to identify abnormalities in individuals with mental disorders. The dynamic segregation and integration of activities across brain regions enable flexible switching between local and global information processing modes. Modeling these scale dynamics within and between brain regions can uncover hidden correlates of brain structure and function in mental disorders. Consequently, we propose a multimodal cross-scale context clusters (MCCocs) model. First, the complementary information in the multimodal image voxels of the brain is integrated and mapped to the original target space to establish a novel voxel-level brain representation. Within each region of interest (ROI), the Voxel Reducer uses a convolution operator to extract local associations among neighboring features and achieves quantitative dimensionality reduction. Among multiple ROIs, the ROI Context Cluster Block performs unsupervised clustering of whole-brain features, capturing nonlinear relationships between ROIs through bidirectional feature aggregation to simulate the effective integration of information across regions. By alternately executing the Voxel Reducer and ROI Context Cluster Block modules multiple times, our model simulates dynamic scale switching within and between ROIs. Experimental results show that MCCocs can recognize potential discriminative biomarkers and achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple mental disorder classification tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/yangshuqigit/MCCocs.

AB Introduction In this study, we investigated the metabolic profiles of yak (Bos grunniens) follicles during the development period from the perspective of metabolomics, aiming to screen out the differential metabolites of yak follicles in different sizes and potential pathways during yak follicle development and to provide a basis for the study of follicle development and developmental mechanisms in the further stage of development. Methods A total of 20 four-year-old female yaks were selected, and follicles of different sizes were collected after slaughter and divided into d < 3 mm, 3-6 mm and d > 6 mm. The follicular fluid was collected, 6 replicates per group and subjected to LC-MS assay, combined with multidimensional and unidimensional statistical analyses to screen the differential metabolites between follicles of different sizes. Differential metabolites enriched KEGG pathways to screen the pathways that might be related to follicle development. Results We found that most of the metabolites were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism pathways, energy metabolism pathways and other pathways of cofactor synthesis, and that during the development of the small follicle to the large follicle, 2-Lysophosphatidylcholine, PC (17:0/0:0), PC (16:0/0:0), and LysoPC (18:0/0:0) were down-regulated; Dioctyl succinate, P-Coumaraldehyde, ISOPRENE, L-Isoleucine, Dioctyl succinate up-regulated. Conclusion These results suggest that amino acid metabolism, the production of steroid hormones and their metabolites, and the metabolic activity of granulosa cells play important roles in follicle development. The results provide a theoretical basis for further exploration of follicular development in yak.

AB The magnetization strategy of isoquinoline alkaloids has been successfully used in the extraction and isolation, but the effect of the magnetization on biological activities of those alkaloids still deserves further investigation. Therefore, the antibacterial, lipid-lowering and antioxidant activities of five isoquinoline alkaloids (berberine, tetrahydroberberine, palmatine, tetrahydropalmatine and tetrahydropapavine) before and after magnetization were compared in this study, and the results showed that the relevant activities were enhanced after magnetization. Additionally, among the five magnetic derivatives studied, berberine magnetic derivative ([Ber<middle dot>H]+[FeCl4]-) had the best antibacterial effect on S. aureus and E. coli with MIC of 200 and 800 mu M, respectively; palmatine magnetic derivative ([Pal<middle dot>H]+[FeCl4]-) showed the strongest lipid-lowering activity with IC50 of 429 mM, and the inhibitory effect and type on lipase was reversible and mixed inhibition of competition and non-competition type; tetrahydroberberine magnetic derivative ([THBer<middle dot>H]+[FeCl4]-) had the strongest antioxidant activity. This study provides new ideas and references for the further application of magnetization strategy.

AB Cultivation of medicinal plants (CMPs) plays a crucial role in sustaining the production resources of medicinal plants (MPs). In light of the depletion of wild medicinal plant resources (MPRs), CMPs have become the primary source for meeting market demand. However, traditional methods of CMPs are often limited, subjective, and time-sensitive. In recent years, remote sensing (RS) has emerged as an important tool for obtaining information on MPs, addressing many of the limitations inherent in conventional techniques. This paper first highlights the challenges faced in CMPs and provides a comprehensive review of the main applications of RS in the field. Subsequently, it summarizes existing methods for analysing RS data, organizing the findings of previous studies according to the types of tasks and methodologies employed. Approaches to RS data analysis that could be applied to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) planning studies are generalized and compared. Finally, the paper discusses potential difficulties in the cultivation process and outlines the future prospects of RS technologies. This review provides the latest research findings on the application of RS in CMPs and can serve as a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners. Additionally, it offers a curated selection of studies for those interested in leveraging RS technologies for precision agriculture in the cultivation of medicinal plants.

AB Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) monolayers are promising materials for the electrochemical sensing of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) nucleobases. However, pristine MoS2 has low sensitivity and selectivity for nucleobase detection. In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how doping MoS2 with boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) affects its interactions with nucleobases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil respectively). We calculated the adsorption energies, response values, and recovery times of nucleobases on doped MoS2 and compared them with those of pristine MoS2. We found that B-, C-, and O-doped MoS2 enhanced the identification and differentiation between nucleobases, but B- and C-doped MoS2 had long recovery times due to the formation of strong chemical bonds between MoS2 and the nucleobases. In contrast, O-doped MoS2 showed good response values for adenine (A) and guanine (G) but poor values for cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). Increasing the oxygen doping concentration to 4.16% improved the response values for all nucleobases and reduced the recovery time to less than 0.133 s at 500 Kelvin. Our results suggest that oxygen-doped MoS2 is a promising substrate for DNA/RNA sequencing applications.

AB To achieve the "3060" dual-carbon goal, China has been constantly advancing its corporate ESG system, aiming to elevate ESG rating. AI technology has become a major driver for improving corporate ESG performance by optimizing decision-making and enhancing resource efficiency through digitalization. This study explores the impact of AI-based digital transformation on corporate ESG performance based on the data of A-share listed multinational companies spanning the years 2009 to 2022. The findings indicate that digital transformation significantly improves enterprises' ESG scores, showing an empowerment effect. The Mediation effect test shows that digital transformation promotes ESG performance by alleviating financial constraints and enhancing green innovation. Government subsidies positively moderate the relationship between digital transformation and financial constraints. In addition, the enhancement of digital transformation on ESG performance is more significant in state-controlled, large-scale enterprises and enterprises with two-job separation. The study provides new perspectives on the construction of ESG system for multinational enterprises in the context of AI technology and suggests that enterprises accelerate their digital transformation and enhance ESG disclosure, while governments and regulators should improve digital infrastructure and provide incentive policies. This study investigates the influence of digital transformation on ESG performance, with a specific emphasis on non-economic benefits. It offers practical insights for multinational enterprises in developing countries to establish and enhance their ESG systems within the context of the digitalera. Furthermore, the findings serve as a critical reference for promoting the integration of AI technologies into ESG practices, thereby advancing sustainable development.

AB The development of a city needs the accumulation of culture, and historical buildings are the most direct witness of the rise and fall of a city. Like the human body, historical buildings have a certain life cycle, but the acceleration of urbanization and unreasonable use cause an irreversible reduction in the residual life of historical buildings. There is a notable lack of quantitative analysis regarding the residual life of historical buildings. Therefore, identifying the factors that influence their residual life is crucial for both preserving these buildings and sustaining urban culture. In order to obtain a more accurate correlation degree of influencing factors, a systematic-analysis model of influencing factors on the residual life of historical buildings based on the entropy weight method (EWM) and the grey relation analysis method (GRA) was established, so as to excavate the mechanism of the influencing factors on the residual life of historical buildings, accurately identify the main influencing factors on the residual life of historical buildings, and propose preventive measures. The results show that the structural system has the greatest influence on the residual life of historical buildings, followed by the enclosure system, and the equipment system. The research findings offer valuable insights for extending the residual life of historical buildings in the future.

However, existing work on accelerated degradation test mainly focuses on the case of a single stress factor. This motivates the need to develop a reliability assessment model for accelerated degradation test involving multiple stress factors. Therefore, this paper proposes a Wiener process-based accelerated degradation test model that simultaneously considers multiple stress factors, random effects and measurement errors. Then the explicit expression for the lifetime distribution under normal operating conditions of the proposed Wiener accelerated degradation test model is obtained, along with its approximate mean lifetime. In addition, the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are derived using the profile likelihood approach, and maximum likelihood estimates for some reliability metrics under normal operating conditions are also obtained. Besides, we construct confidence intervals for model parameters and some reliability metrics using the bias-corrected and accelerated percentile bootstrap method. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, and a numerical example.

AB Long-term time series forecasting presents a critical challenge across numerous application domains. Recently, various transformer-based models have been employed for this task; however, these methods face two key challenges: difficulty in retaining local series information and failure to fully capture the overall trend of time series. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model called Patch Time Series Fourier-former Linear (PatchTSFL), which incorporates three innovative features: 1) A patching operation that splits long-term series into multiple patches, using the number of patches as the input length of the encoder, which preserves local sequence information while reducing model complexity; 2) A Fourier-enhanced block that replaces the traditional transformer's multi-attention mechanism, capturing important information by converting time domain data into frequency domain mapping, further reducing computational complexity; 3) A Mixture Of Experts Decomposition block (MOEDecomp) that decomposes the series, enabling comprehensive capture of the overall time series trend. We conducted extensive experiments on nine widely-used long-term time series datasets, comparing PatchTSFL with state-of-the-art transformer-based models. Results demonstrate that PatchTSFL significantly improves forecasting accuracy (31.9% reduction in MSE and 19.0% reduction in MAE on average) while maintaining the lowest model complexity and runtime (4.3 times faster than FEDformer). These findings establish PatchTSFL as an effective and efficient solution for long-term time series prediction. The source code is available at: https://github.com/WESTBROOK-0/PatchTSFL.

AB This paper investigates the load frequency control problem for nonlinear multi-area power system that incorporates pumped storage hydropower. First, a unified Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is developed to represent the nonlinear dynamics of power exchange progress in pumped storage hydropower, including uncertainties. Subsequently, a fuzzy logic algorithm is applied by incorporating both system error and its derivative to dynamically adjust the trigger threshold, an adaptive resilient event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce communication burden while improving control performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov functional is constructed to ensure that the system is stable and strictly (D-1, D-2, D-3)-lambda - dissipative. Finally, a three-area power system is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

AB Due to the probability characteristics of quantum mechanism, the combination of quantum mechanism and intelligent algorithm has received wide attention. Quantum dynamics theory uses the Schr & ouml;dinger equation as a quantum dynamics equation. Through three approximation of the objective function, quantum dynamics framework (QDF) is obtained which describes basic iterative operations of optimization algorithms. Based on QDF, this paper proposes a potential barrier estimation (PBE) method which originates from quantum mechanism. With the proposed method, the particle can accept inferior solutions during the sampling process according to a probability which is subject to the quantum tunneling effect, to improve the global search capacity of optimization algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method in the ability of escaping local minima was thoroughly investigated through double well function (DWF), and experiments on two benchmark functions sets show that this method significantly improves the optimization performance of high dimensional complex functions. The PBE method is quantized and easily transplanted to other algorithms to achieve high performance in the future.

AB Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects millions globally and poses a serious public health challenge. Current therapeutic strategies, including corticosteroids, are constrained by variable patient responses and adverse effects. In this study, a polyphenolic extract derived from the Tibetan medicinal plant Spenceria ramalana Trimen (SRT) was employed and shown to improve experimentally (ovalbumin + cigarette smoke, OVA + CS) induced asthma in rats. Initially, the potential therapeutic mechanism of the polyphenolic components in SRT on OVA + CS-induced asthma was predicated by network pharmacology analysis. Subsequently, in vivo experiments identified that SRT polyphenols exhibit significant anti-asthmatic activities, primarily mediated by lowering inflammatory cell counts such as the WBC (white blood cell), eosinophils, and neutrophils, decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-alpha), alleviating lung histological damage (reduced inflammation, collagen deposition, and mucus secretion), and enhancing the epithelial barrier integrity (upregulation of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1). Additionally, SRT polyphenols downregulated the PI3K/Akt (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B) signaling pathway, improved gut microbiota disruption, and regulated fecal metabolites (glucose-6-glutamate, PS (16:0/0:0), 8-aminocaprylic acid, galactonic acid, Ascr#10, 2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydroxyheptanoic acid, phosphodimethylethanolamine, muramic acid, 9-oxohexadeca-10e-enoic acid, and sedoheptulose) in asthmatic rats. In conclusion, SRT polyphenols exerted multifaceted protective effects against OVA + CS-induced asthma in rats, highlighting their potential value in preventing asthma via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB Aichivirus D (AiV-D) is a newly emerging diarrhea-associated pathogen in cattle and sheep, and comprised two officially recognized genotypes (AiV-D1 and AiV-D2) and two potential novel genotypes (AiV-D3 and AiV-D4). This study aimed to establish a fluorescent RT-PCR assay for detecting AiV-D and to investigate its prevalence in yak diarrheic samples. A SYBR Green fluorescent RT-PCR assay was successfully established by targeting the conserved region of viral 3D genes, enabling detection of all known AiV-D genotypes. The established assay was specific for AiV-D, exhibiting no cross-reactivity with other common diarrhea-causing pathogens in ruminants, with coefficients of variation for reproducibility ranging from 0.23% to 2.16% and detection limits for the positive plasmids of AiV-D1 to AiV-D4 at 2.21, 4.78, 4.10, and 5.94 copies/mu L, respectively. Of the 166 diarrheic samples collected from calf yaks across nine farms in Sichuan province, China, between May and August 2023, 22.3% (37/166) tested positive for AiV-D, suggesting its substantial prevalence within the sampled region. Furthermore, seven complete 3D gene sequences were cloned from positive samples, and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct evolutionary patterns among these isolates. In conclusion, this newly established assay represents a reliable diagnostic tool for AiV-D detection, while our findings provide significant insights into the epidemiological distribution and evolutionary dynamics of AiV-D in the yak population.

AB The difficulty in magnetic multitarget recognition is that it is difficult to recognize magnetic targets with different magnetic moments and different depths at the same time. This is because the magnetic moment and depth of a magnetic target affect the strength of the generated magnetic field information, resulting in localization results that favor targets that generate stronger magnetic fields, while targets with weaker magnetic fields cannot be accurately identified. In addition, the traditional Euler equation-based multitarget localization method requires calibration of the sensor array before detection, which requires high calibration accuracy as it relies on the inversion of mathematical equations to solve for magnetic targets. To address this problem, this article proposes an inverse tangent function imaging processing method based on the magnetic gradient tensor (MGT) information depth direction change rate. The method aims to balance the differences in magnetic field information between different magnetic targets and enhance the recognition of the horizontal position of targets with weaker magnetic fields. Based on this, a depth detection method (DDM) based on MGT is proposed to acquire the depth information of magnetic targets. A grid-format data acquisition method is also proposed to obtain the MGT. The method does not require calibration of the sensor array or separation of the magnetic anomaly field from the total field. Simulation and experimental results show that the positioning error of this method for each magnetic target in the x-, y-, and z-axes is less than 0.15 m. For a magnetic target with a depth of 1 m, the x-axis error is 0.15 m, the y-axis error is 0.05 m, and the z-axis error is 0.06 m. For a magnetic target with a depth of 0.7 m, the x-axis error is 0.08 m, the y-axis error is 0.12 m, and the z-axis error is 0.13 m.

AB Objectives Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is widely acknowledged as a significant threat to food safety and human health. This research focused on the characteristics of bacteriocin Q13 produced by Lactococcus lactis Q13 isolated from the traditional Chinese fermented food hairy tofu.Materials and Methods The biosynthetic gene clusters of bacteriocins were identified through whole-genome sequencing of L. lactis Q13. The antibacterial activity of its cell-free supernatant was assessed against MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria. Subsequently, bacteriocin Q13 was purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Its molecular weight was determined via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and structural features were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Stability of bacteriocin Q13 under various conditions (enzymes, organic solvents, surfactants, metal ions, UV exposure, NaCl concentration, and storage time and temperature) was evaluated. The antimicrobial mode of action was investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Results Bacteriocin Q13 exhibited a significant bacteriostatic effect against MRSA and a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Its molecular weight was 19367.97 Da, with dominant secondary structures identified as beta-turn and beta-sheet. Bacteriocin Q13 demonstrated remarkable stability under different conditions. SEM analysis showed that bacteriocin Q13 was able to induce significant morphological changes in MRSA, including disruption of cellular morphology, impairment of membrane integrity, and leakage of cytoplasmic contents, revealing the bacteriostatic mechanism of bacteriocin Q13 against MRSA.Conclusions Bacteriocin Q13 from L. lactis Q13 exhibits considerable potential as a natural antimicrobial compound for controlling MRSA contamination in food products. These results lay a scientific foundation for the application of L. lactis Q13 and its bacteriocin in the food industry as potential probiotics and preservatives.

AB This article addresses the asynchronous control issue for a class of switched systems with norm-bounded external disturbances within a finite time interval. Firstly, a predicted model-based observer is constructed for switched systems. In the case of updates without actual output, the output predictor is introduced to compensate for the effects of an event-triggered scheme (ETS), while at triggered instants, the predicted output is reset to the latest triggered output. Secondly, a novel state-dependent switching (SDS) rule with fixed dwell time is developed within the framework of switched systems, integrating estimation performance, system performance, and ETS-designed dynamic variables. Thirdly, a new dynamic ETS related to both the output error and the predicted error is designed to optimize network resource utilization efficiency. Due to the ETS, the asynchronous behaviour among the controller, observer and system modes arises. Then, a novel multiple Lyapunov function is proposed to effectively characterize hybrid switching dynamics with coexisting synchronous and asynchronous modes in the closed-loop switched systems. Based on this framework, a unified finite-time H-infinity stabilization criterion is established, explicitly addressing switched systems containing partially or fully unstabilizable subsystems. Further, the Zeno behaviour of the designed ETS is ruled out by proving the existence of a minimum triggered interval. Finally, two practical simulations with comparative studies are conducted to substantiate the effectiveness of the derived results. Note to Practitioners-This work addresses practical challenges in controlling networked switched systems, such as those in autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart grids, where limited network resources and partial state observability are critical concerns. Our approach focuses on three key aspects. Firstly, we develop a predictive observer to compensate for intermittent sensor data caused by event-triggered communication. This ensures reliable state estimation even during non-triggered intervals, enabling robust control without continuous sensing. Secondly, a novel ETS is designed to dynamically adjust data transmission based on real-time output prediction errors and system dynamics. Compared to some published ETS methods, it reduces unnecessary network traffic while maintaining control performance. Thirdly, our state-dependent switching strategy and hybrid Lyapunov framework rigorously guarantee finite-time stability, even when controller and observer modes operate asynchronously. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control method achieves the expected objectives.

AB The effects of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) pre-treatment on the in vitro maturation (IVM) and developmental competence of yak (Bos grunniens) oocytes were evaluated. The results showed that 100 nM CNP could effectively maintain meiotic arrest of yak oocytes in vitro within 6 h. Yak oocytes matured in two-step IVM (pre-IVM with 100 nM CNP for 6 h followed by conventional IVM for 28 h) yielded a significantly (P < .05) increased cleavage rate, blastocyst rate after in vitro fertilization with cattle spermatozoa compared to the conventional one-step IVM method. The density of transzonal projections (TZPs) decreased after 6 h standard IVM (P < .05), whereas, COCs pre-IVM with 100 nM CNP for 6 h maintained the same density of TZPs compared to the fresh COCs. This pre-IVM resulted in lesser reactive oxygen species level (P < .05). Two-step IVM resulted in the increased glutathione levels, mRNA expression levels of BCL2, BMP15, and GDF9 (P < .05) in oocytes. In conclusion, these results indicate that CNP treatment (100 nM, 6 h) before IVM could enhance the maturation of yak oocytes and developmental competence of their crossbred embryos. This may have important applications in in vitro production of yak crossbred embryos.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection causes reproductive failure and respiratory distress and is a serious threat to the swine industry, given its continuous and rapid emergence. The knowledge of viral-host interaction could facilitate anti-PRRSV drug development. HnRNP A1 is an abundantly expressed protein which associates with RNA metabolic processes and plays multifarious roles during the reproduction cycle of multiple viruses. However, the function of porcine HnRNP A1 in PRRSV-2 replication is still unknown. Herein, HnRNP A1 was identified as a nucleocapsid (N)-binding protein for PRRSV-2. Overexpression of porcine HnRNP A1 promoted the expression of viral RNA, and viral proteins, corresponding to enhanced virus titers. While deletion of the UP1 domain abolished the HnRNP A1-mediated enhancement of PRRSV-2 replication. In addition, HnRNP A1-silencing confirmed its pro-viral effect on PRRSV-2 infectivity in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation verification confirmed that the UP1 domain is important for the recognition of the guanine-rich sequence (GRS) in PRRSV-2 negative RNA. Eventually, supplementation with TMPyP4, a G4 ligand, efficiently provokes the release of HnRNP A1 from GRS, thereby limiting PRRSV-2 replication. Together, these findings help to inform the mechanism by which HnRNP A1 accelerates PRRSV-2 replication, and facilitate antiviral drug design.

TI APOVIS: Automated pixel-level open-vocabulary instance segmentation

AB In recent years, substantial advancements have been achieved in vision-language integration and image segmentation, particularly through the use of pre-trained models like BERT and Vision Transformer (ViT). Within the domain of open-vocabulary instance segmentation (OVIS), accurately identifying an instance's positional information is critical, as it directly influences the precision of subsequent segmentation tasks. However, many existing methods rely on supplementary networks to generate pseudo-labels, such as multiple anchor frames containing object positional information. While these pseudo-labels aid visual language models in recognizing the absolute position of objects, they often compromise the overall efficiency and performance of the OVIS pipeline. In this study, we introduce a novel Automated Pixel-level OVIS (APOVIS) framework aimed at enhancing OVIS. Our approach automatically generates pixel-level annotations by leveraging the matching capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models for image-text pairs alongside a foundational segmentation model that accepts multiple prompts (e.g., points or anchor boxes) to guide the segmentation process. Specifically, our method first utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to match instances within image-text pairs to identify relative positions. Next, we employ activation maps to visualize the instances, enabling us to extract instance location information and generate pseudo-label prompts that direct the segmentation process. These pseudo-labels then guide the segmentation model to execute pixel-level segmentation, enhancing both the accuracy and generalizability of object segmentation across images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models in object detection accuracy and pixel- level instance segmentation on the COCO dataset. Additionally, the generalizability of our approach is validated through image-text pair data inference tasks on the Open Images, Pascal VOC 2012, Pascal Context, and ADE20K datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/ijetma/APOVIS.

AB Opioids/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to alleviate pain; however, they are expensive and can have adverse effects, especially when used over extended periods. Therefore, there is immense demand for innovative, non-addictive analgesics. Here, we report a novel plant-derived central anti-nociceptive agent, Liparis nervosa (Thunb.) Lindl. (LN), validated in animal pain models. Ethyl acetate fractions of L. nervosa (EALN) exhibited central anti-nociceptive activity in hot plate, tail immersion, formalin-induced paw oedema, and acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing tests. The chemical composition of the EALN was determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Reserpine (monoamine transmitter-depleting agent) and naltrexone (opioid antagonist) partially suppressed the anti-nociceptive effect of EALN in both phases of the formalin test. Oral administration of EALN activated the endogenous opioid and central descending inhibitory systems by increasing beta-endorphin, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and norepinephrine expression. EALN treatment increased the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid B; inhibited the expression of prostaglandin E2, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and c-Fos; and blocked the transmission of pain signals in the spinal cord. EALN treatment reduced the activity of nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase in the central region and inhibited the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate signal transduction pathway, thereby attenuating the transmission of nociceptive information in the descending inhibitory pathways. The central anti-nociceptive effect of EALN was achieved by integrating these pathways. This study provides new insights into the pharmacologic action of LN and provide a therapeutic approach as a promising candidate for central anti-nociceptive agents.

ID ATTENTION
AB In order to improve the performance of hyperspectral open set recognition processing with insufficient sample size, the authors propose a new supervised contrastive learning (SCL) framework (FSSCL-OSC) that can achieve open-set classification of hyperspectral images in scenarios with very few sample sizes, which consists of three steps. First, supervised contrastive learning (SCL) with geometric transformations is designed, which uses rotated labels as supervision to obtain lower-level characteristics that more accurately capture various orientations and then makes use of a spectral-spatial characteristic extraction network to maximize the utilization of HSI's spectrum and spatial information. Next, a class anchor open-set classification module based on a twin clustering network is designed, which uses SCL and FSL to extract more specific personal information by mining the category-invariant characteristics present in the known versus unknown class data. Finally, multiple convolution and open-set recognition (OSC) is performed on the feature blocks. Experimental results on three classical HSI datasets show that FSSCL-OSC provides a significant improvement over existing methods, under a sample size of only 10%, the overall accuracy reached 82.38%, 90.76% and 84.70%, respectively.

AB Currently, most memristor-based neural networks (MBNNs) models are switching systems with fixed jumping values, which may limit their applications. To tackle this issue, this paper first constructs a new MBNNs system based on HP memristors. Then the finite time (FT) intermittent stabilization of this MBNNs is investigated via a new finite time stability lemma and the designed no-chattering region-partitioning intermittent control (RPIC). Compared to previous intermittent control, the work or rest intervals in our RPIC strategy are not predesigned, but defined based on the relationship between the constructed V(T) and two auxiliary functions V(T), V(T). Finally, the validity of the proposed MBNNs and the theoretical method is verified through numerical simulation and image encryption application.

SO BMJ OPEN

DT Article
ID HESITANCY; COVID-19
AB Objectives Vaccine hesitancy persists as a significant global health concern, especially during public health crises. This study aimed to explore factors influencing vaccination acceptance during a major public health crisis and establish a model of influencing factors. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online, encompassing sociodemographic characteristics, anxiety levels, personal risk perception and attitudes towards vaccination acceptance. Data analysis was performed using t-tests, one-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression techniques in IBM SPSS Statistics V.25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results A total of 3921 participants participated in the survey. The mean acceptance attitudes were above the moderate level (M=4.02, SD=0.51), the mean risk perception score was below the moderate level (M=2.66, SD=0.58), and the mean score on the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was also below the moderate level (M=2.05, SD=0.53). The results showed that internal variables (gender, age, marital status, professional background, region) and external variables (average family income, distance from home to vaccination site, family medical background) were statistically significant (p<0.05). Gender, region, distance from home to the vaccination site, anxiety, family medical background, risk coping, emotional perception and psychological representation of unusual severity were identified as significant predictors of vaccination acceptance attitudes, with the model explaining 35% of the variance (R-2= 0.35, adjusted R-2= 0.33). Based on these results, we constructed a theoretical model of influencing factors for vaccine acceptance attitudes. Conclusions Despite increased acceptance of vaccination during major public health events, factors that both support and hinder acceptance remain. Identifying these factors allows for effective disease control and informs the development of public health strategies and crisis response measures.

AB Background Meconopsis quintuplinervia Regel (MQ) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used for clearing liver and lung heat in Tibetan medicine for over a thousand years. However, the lack of quality markers that correlate with pharmacological actions and absorption in vivo limits the safety and efficacy in its clinical application and on the drug market. Furthermore, a universal and rapid method for simultaneously determining quality markers in the MQ crude drug is still lacking.Purpose An absorption-based metabolite approach was used to discover and identify the quality markers of MQ. An efficient method based on polarity-switching ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) was then established to determine the quality markers.Methods The absorbed compounds and metabolites were first characterized using UPLC plus Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS) after giving oral MQ extract to rats. Subsequently, the absorbed compounds and precursors of metabolites correlating with the hepatocyte protection activity were screened as quality markers. Finally, a polarity-switching UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method was developed for the quantitative analysis of the MQ crude drug, enabling the detection of quality markers in both negative and positive ion modes in a single run. The MS2 characteristics of target compounds were investigated to select appropriate product ions.Results A total of 13 absorbed compounds and 30 metabolites were characterized. Among these, nine compounds, including five absorbed compounds and four precursors of metabolites intimately correlated with hepatocyte protection activity and absorption in vivo, were considered the quality markers of MQ in the current study. The quantification of quality markers was conducted using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.8 mu m) column, the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid solution (containing 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate). The validated UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method was successfully applied to quantify the quality markers in the MQ crude drug.Conclusion We defined the quality markers and established a universal and rapid method for simultaneously determining the quality markers of MQ, which will be helpful for further investigation of the quality evaluation of MQ in clinical application and the drug market.

AB The content and composition of intramuscular fat (IMF) affect the cooked meat palatability such as tenderness and juiciness. Thus, elucidation of lipid deposition and its composition in goat IMF is necessary. Here, Jianzhou big-ear goats with higher IMF content is associated with lower mRNA level of LKB1 gene, compared with those of Chuannan black goats. Functionally, knockdown of LKB1 promoted intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation. Next, LC-MS/MS based pseudo target analysis found that 409 lipids existed in goat intramuscular adipocytes, of which polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for most lipids. Compared with the control, 78 differential lipids were screened in the si LKB1 group, enriched in the triacylglycerols and fatty acids subclasses. The combined analysis between lipidomic and published transcriptomic data showed that siLKB1 enhanced polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis through upregulation expression of HACD4. Finally, the promotion of lipid accumulation and polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesis in the LKB1 knockdown cells were partly rescued by ablation of HACD4. Collectively, these data provide a genetic target to produce PUFA enriched functional goat meat and expand new insights into improvement of meat quality.

AB It is increasingly urgent to constantly monitor and analyze the carbon emission of international tourism activities. This paper focuses on countries and regions along the Belt and Road (B&R), utilizes the MRIO model to approximate international tourism carbon footprint (ITCT), and analyzes the patterns of carbon transfer. Panel model is further applied to discuss the effects of various influencing factors. The results show that: 1) in 2015, ITCT along the B&R accounts for approximately 40.74% of global carbon emission of the year; 2) ITCT along the B&R experienced continuous growth from 2005 to 2015, with an annual growth rate of 3.22%; 3) individual income level, urbanization, and air passenger volume in the countries along the B&R has positive impact on ITCT, which varies according to the income level of the country. The results are of significance for countries and regions along the B&R to formulate future policies for tourism development.

   INFORMATION; ENTROPY; ALGORITHM; KNOWLEDGE
AB Neighborhood rough set (NRS) have been successfully applied to attribute reduction (AR). However, most current methods of AR based on NRS are supervised or semi-supervised. This limits their ability to process data without decision information. When granulating data samples, NRS considers only the number of samples within the neighborhood radius. It does not consider distribution information between samples, which can result in the loss of original data information. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose an unsupervised attribute reduction (UAR) strategy based on variable precision weighted neighborhood dependency (VPWND) (UAR_VPWND). We compare algorithm UAR_VPWND to existing classical UAR algorithms using public datasets. The experimental results show that algorithm UAR_VPWND can select fewer attributes to maintain or improve the performance of clustering learning algorithms.

AB A simple and mild catalytic SN2 '-type displacement of propargyl halides with organotitanium reagents is reported. The SN2 '-type displacement of propargyl bromides with organotitanium reagents mediated by CuI (2 mol %)/MePPh2(4 mol%) in dichloro methane afforded multi-substituted allenes in good yields (up to 95 %) at 40 degrees C for 5 h. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in aryltitanium reagents gave multisubstituted allenes in good yields. In addition, the di-substituted allenes bearing a naphthyl group was obtained in 54-99 % selectivities with isolated yields of 43-83 %. The process was simple and easily performed, and it provides an efficient method for the synthesis of di-substituted allene derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

AB The severe conditions at high altitudes, where yaks inhabit, contribute to delayed muscular growth and compromised tenderness of their muscle tissue. Myosatellite cells are responsible for the growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle after birth and have the potential to proliferate and differentiate, its development is closely related to meat quality, and the nuclear receptor gene NR1D1 is involved in muscle formation and skeletal muscle regulation. Therefore, in order to understand the effect of NR1D1 on muscle satellite cells, we identified the mRNA expression levels of marker genes specifically expressed in muscle satellite cells at different stages to determine the type of cells isolated. Eventually, we successfully constructed a primary cell line of yak muscle satellite cells. Then we constructed NR1D1 overexpression vector and interference RNA, and introduced them into isolated yak skeletal muscle satellite cells. We performed qPCR, CCK8, and fluorescence-specific to detect the expression of genes or abundance of proteins as markers of cell proliferation and differentiation. Compared with those in the control group, the expression levels of proliferation marker genes KI-67, CYCLIND1, and CYCLINA were significantly inhibited after NR1D1 overexpression, which was also supported by the CCK-8 test, whereas differentiation marker genes MYOD, MYOG, and MYF5 were significantly inhibited. Fluorescence-specific staining showed that KI-67 protein abundance and the number of microfilaments both decreased, while the opposite trend was observed after NR1D1 interference. In conclusion, we confirmed that NR1D1 inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of yak skeletal muscle satellite cells, which provides a theoretical basis for further research on the effect of NR1D1 on improving meat quality traits and meat production performance of yaks.

AB Adipocyte play an important role in human health and meat quality by influencing the tenderness, flavor, and juiciness of mutton It has been shown that neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NENF) is closely related to energy metabolism and adipocyte differentiation in bovine. However, the role of NENF in the goats remains unclear. The aim of this study was to detect the expression of NENF in goat subcutaneous and intramuscular adipocytes, temporal expression profiles of the NENF, and overexpressed NENF on the differentiation of different adipocytes. In this study, PCR amplification successfully cloned the goat NENF gene with a fragment length of 521 bp. In addition, the time point of highest expression of NENF differed between these two adipocytes differentiation processes. Overexpression of NENF in intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes promoted the expression levels of differentiation markers CEBP beta and SREBP, which in turn promoted the differentiation of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes. This study will provide basic data for further study of the role of goats in goat adipocyte differentiation and for the final elucidation of its molecular mechanisms in regulating goat adipocyte deposition.

AB Apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrion-associated 2 (AIFM2) has been identified as a gene with anti-ferroptosis properties. To explore whether AIFM2 exerts anti-ferroptosis role in yaks (Bos grunniens), we cloned yak AIFM2 gene and analyzed its biological characteristics. The coding region of AIFM2 had 1122 bp and encoded 373 amino acids, which was conserved in mammals. Next, RT-qPCR results showed an extensive expression of AIMF2 in yak tissues. Furthermore, we isolated yak skin fibroblasts (YSFs) and established a bisphenol A (BPA)-induced ferroptosis model to further investigate the role of AIFM2. BPA elevated oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, ROS) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA and BODIPY), and reduced cell viability and antioxidant capacity (glutathione, GSH), with the severity depending on the dosage. Of note, a supplement of Ferrostatin-1 (Fer), an inhibitor of ferroptosis, restored the previously mentioned indicators. Subsequently, we constructed an AIFM2 overexpression vector and designed AIFM2 specific interfering siRNAs, which were transfected into YSFs. The results showed that overexpressing AIFM2 alleviated ferroptosis, characterizing by significant changes of cell viability, ROS, BODIPY, MDA and GSH. Meanwhile, interfering AIFM2 aggravated ferroptosis, demonstrating the critical anti-ferroptosis role of the yak AIFM2 gene. This study shed light on further exploring the molecular mechanism of AIFM2 in plateau adaptability.

AB Interferon-beta (IFN beta) is an important member of the type I interferon family and plays key roles in antiviral response and treatment of autoimmune disease. However, the immunomodulation and antimicrobial potential of yak IFN beta 3 protein are still unclear. In the current study, the 558 bp long cDNA sequence of the yak IFN beta 3 gene was amplified and successfully expressed in a prokaryotic system. The mRNA expression level of IFN beta 3 in yak spleen was higher than in heart, liver, lung and kidney. The minimum inhibitory concentration of recombinant IFN beta 3 protein against Klebsiella pneumoniae was determined to be 64 mu g/mL. The activity, phagocytosis, and nucleic acid intensity of yak macrophages were significantly increased by IFN beta 3 protein (P < 0.05). In addition, the vitality of macrophages infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly increased by IFN beta 3 protein (P < 0.05). The IFN beta 3 protein significantly reduced the release of nitric oxide (NO) from macrophages infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of Capg, Man2b1, Mrc-1, gamma-actin and Marco in macrophages were upregulated by IFN beta 3 protein (P < 0.05). The contents of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the serum of mice after Klebsiella pneumoniae infection were reduced by IFN beta 3 protein (P < 0.05). The lung and kidney injuries in mice induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection were alleviated by IFN beta 3 protein. In summary, the yak IFN beta 3 protein enhanced macrophage activity and reduced the damage caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in mice.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), capable of hydrolyzing phosphate groups, possesses significant implications in providing valuable insights into the ecological and environmental conditions through its presence and activity in environmental water. Thus, the determination of ALP activity is of great significance. An ALP-responsive coordination polymer named CuAMP was synthesized at room temperature with copper ions and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The ALP catalyzed the hydrolysis of the phosphate group in AMP, causing the collapse of the CuAMP material and the release of free Cu ions served as the element target, which were quantified directly by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS) after centrifugation, providing a signal that indicates the activity of ALP. This method allows for selective, sensitive, and easy detection of ALP without the need of intricate labeling operations, with linear range of 1-80 U/L and a detection limit of 0.4 U/L.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that can hydrolyze phosphate groups, and its activity is related to algal bloom outbreaks in eutrophic waters. A magnetic ALP-responsive material named Fe3O4@INV/Zn-AMP was synthesized at room temperature by using zinc ions and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) as building blocks integrated invertase (INV). When ALP is present, it hydrolyzes the phosphate group of AMP, causing the disassembly of the Fe3O4@INV/Zn-AMP material and the release of signaling molecule (INV). After magnet separation, the released INV can digest sucrose into glucose measured by a personal glucometer (PGM), providing a signal that indicates the activity of ALP. This method allows for selective, sensitive, and easy detection of ALP in field settings without the need for complicated labeling operations. Benefit from the selective stimulus-response and the enzyme catalyzed amplification, a simple and portable method for the monitoring of ALP using PGM was established, with linear range of 0.005-0.2 U/mL and a detection limit of 0.001 U/mL, which showed the potential of field monitoring for alkaline phosphatase in the future.

AB This paper conducts experiments on a sample of subjects from Chengdu and Wuhan, China, who are mostly unconcerned about air pollution. We provide evidence on the relationship between air quality and financial risk aversion by assessing the plausibility of two channels: affects and cognitive ability. We find that air pollution increases the financial risk aversion of subjects who are concerned about it by altering their emotional responses. However, the cognitive abilities of our subjects are not affected by air pollution, regardless of whether they are concerned about the pollution or not. Meanwhile, we show that reference dependence effect can explain why most subjects in our sample are not highly concerned about air quality. The results of our study stress the importance of beliefs about the impact of air pollution in determining the relationship between air pollution and human behavior.

AB Parental involvement and teacher support have protective effects on adolescents' externalizing behaviors. However, few studies investigated their interaction on externalizing behaviors among Chinese adolescents from divorced families. Guided by the stress-buffering theory, this cross-sectional study investigated the interactive effects between parental divorce, parental involvement, and teacher support on adolescents' externalizing behaviors among Chinese adolescents. Participants were the nationally representative sample of 8218 Chinese students (Mage = 14.51 years, SD = 0.68 years; including 560 students from divorced families and 7658 students from intact families). Parental involvement, teacher support, and externalizing behaviors were primarily measured by related items in a student-reported questionnaire. Results indicated that: (1) adolescents from divorced families had lower levels of parental involvement and higher levels of externalizing behaviors compared with adolescents from intact families; (2) teacher support had stronger protective effect on externalizing behaviors among adolescents from divorced families compared with adolescents from intact families; (3) the interactive effect between parental involvement and teacher support on externalizing behaviors was significant among adolescents from divorced families, but not significant for adolescents from intact families. These findings support the stress-buffering model of social support, and have important practical implications for preventing externalizing behaviors among adolescents from divorced families.

AB Background: Serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) deletion and downregulation caused cancer progression, and were widely associated with drug resistance. Accurate screening of natural small molecules about anti-cancer and anti-drug resistance is the key to the development and utilization of natural product application, which could promote traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of cancer. Dauricine, which is derived from the rhizome of Menispermum dauricum DC., has certain potential but unexplored mechanism for the treatment of cancer. Purpose: The aim of this study was to screen and validate the role and mechanism of natural STK11 agonists with anti-drug resistance from plants in the treatment of NSCLC. Methods: A lentiviral STK11 overexpression cell model was employed for the screening of natural STK11 agonists. The efficacy of dauricine in the treatment of NSCLC was validated on PC-9 and HCC827 cells. In vivo validation of dauricine activity was performed using nude mouse models equipped with PC9 xenografts. To investigate the anti-resistant effects of dauricine, gefitinib-resistant PC9 cell models were constructed. Results: As a natural agonist of STK11, it causes the activation of the STK11/AMPK pathway and inhibits the growth of PC-9 cells. Dauricine synergises the inhibitory effect with gefitinib on PC9. The up-regulation of STK11 protein expression by dauricine was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, while restoring the sensitivity of PC9/GR to gefitinib by down-regulating the protein expression of Nrf2 and Pgp. Conclusion: Dauricine, a natural agonist of STK11, effectively inhibited NSCLC, and its combination treatment with gefitinib reversed drug-resistant NSCLC.

AB Introduction The CDO1 gene is an important gene in the taurine synthesis pathway and has been observed to have high expression in ovaries of female mammals. This study aims to explore the conservation of CDO1 gene in domestic yaks, as well as to examine the fundamental characteristics of CDO1 gene and its expression in female yaks. Methods Ovarian samples were collected from yaks in the follicular phase, luteal phase and gestation period in this experiment, and their total RNA and protein were extracted. Then Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and bioinformatics online software were used to clone and analyze the CDO1 gene. The relative expression of CDO1 in yak ovaries was detected by Quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. The distribution and localization of CDO1 protein in ovary were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results We have successfully cloned the coding region of CDO1 gene in yak. The results showed that the CDS region of CDO1 gene was 603 bp, encoding 200 amino acids, and was a relatively stable hydrophilic protein. CDO1 is relatively conservative in species evolution. The protein encoded by CDO1 gene does not have a signaling peptide or a transmembrane structure. It is a protein that is not involved in transmembrane transport and is mainly located in the cytoplasm. The secondary structure of the protein is dominated by the random coil. CDO1 is estimated to interact with 10 proteins. The results of RT-qPCR and Western blotting showed that the CDO1 gene exhibited the highest expression in the ovary during the luteal phase and the lowest expression in the ovary during the follicular phase (P < 0.01). The results of immunohistochemistry showed that CDO1 was mainly expressed in granular cells, theca cells and lutein cells of ovarian tissue. Conclusion These results suggest that the CDO1 gene has undergone minimal evolutionary changes during the course of animal evolution. The results provide a reference for further investigation of the function of CDO1 gene in reproduction and production in yaks.

AB Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only large mammal species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The most of the studies in yak remain confined for the main contributor of meat, which requires a good understanding of muscle growth. Matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 are widely expressed in mammal tissues they mainly degrade collagen in the extracellular matrix for muscle development. However, the influence of MMPs on yak muscle remains unclear. Hence, we assessed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and related factors with ages in Maiwa yak for study the correlation between MMPs expression and yak muscle growth. The mRNA expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-14, and collagen III increased with age, except collagen I by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, muscle fiber diameter increased with age, whereas the density decreased, which showed that fiber grew thicker with age using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Interestingly, MMP and collagen expression significantly decreased with age using western blotting. Pearson correlation method showed that both mRNA and protein expression of MMP-14 and collagen were strongly correlated with muscle fiber growth, but MMP-2 protein and MMP-9 mRNA expression were moderately correlated with muscle fiber growth. Overall, the expression of MMPs and collagen significantly changed with age, which means that MMPs and their function related genes could correlate with Maiwa yak muscle fiber growth.

AB Phosphorous-based polymeric scale and corrosion are widely used for industrial water treatment. In this paper, phosphorous acid modified polyamidoamine dendrimer (PDD) was prepared for scale inhibition and corrosion inhibition and compared with the existing inhibitors, 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA) and polyacrylic. The scale inhibition efficiency of CaCO3 was evaluated using the static scale inhibition and conductivity method. Compared to polyacrylic acid, the dendritic structure can effectively improve the calcium carbonate scale inhibition performance of the scale inhibitor. When the concentration of PDD is 40 mg/L, the scale inhibition rate is 96%, which is higher than the scale inhibition rate of 91% for PBTCA. The conductivity experimental results reveal that PDD endows the solution with higher supersaturation degree than that of PBTCA at the same concentration. Furthermore, the nucleation induction period of PDD is 1300 s, which is more than twice that of PBTCA at a concentration below 20 mg/L. The XPS, XRD, and SEM results exhibited that PDD can adsorb on the surface of calcium carbonate crystals, changing the crystals from stable calcite to metastable aragonite and vaterite. In addition, electrochemical measurements show a corrosion inhibition rate of 82.67% at a PDD concentration of 100 mg/L. This article provides data support for the application of phosphorous acid functionalization PAMAM in scale and corrosion inhibition.
   Phosphorous acid functionalization polyamidoamine dendrimer (PDD) has excellent scale inhibition performance, and when its concentration is 20 mg/L, the scale inhibition rate of calcium carbonate reaches more than 90%. PDD can chelate with Ca2+, increase the supersaturation values of CaCO3 of solution, and thus prolonging the nucleation induction period of calcium carbonate. Moreover, XDR and XPS results indicate that PDD can bind to calcium carbonate crystals, slow down the crystal growth rate, and cause crystal lattice distortion. In addition, PDD has a corrosion inhibition rate of 82.67% at a PDD concentration of 100 mg/L. image

AB The control of flowering time plays an important role in the growth and development of potato tubers. The CCT (CO, COL and TOC1) gene family is involved in the flowering process of plants. In this study, a total of 32 StCCT family genes were identified and further classified into five subfamilies, including COL (17 members), PRR (4 members), ZIM (3 members), ASML2 (6 members) and TCR1 (2 members), based on their phylogenetic relationship. An analysis of the gene structure, motif compositions and conserved domain provided support for this classification. The StCCT genes were unevenly distributed on 12 chromosomes of the potato plant. In total, six gene duplication events were observed, which played a crucial role in the expansion of the StCCT family genes in the potato. The expression profiles exhibited diverse expression patterns of the StCCT genes in six tissues (leaf, shoot, root, tuber, stolon, and flower), StCCT32 is only expressed in flowers, while StCCT19 and StCCT8 are highly expressed in flowers and tubers, respectively. The StCCT genes exhibit different expression patterns in response to IAA and TIBA treatments at different concentrations across three tissues (leaf, stem, and tuber). After IAA and TIBA treatments, it was found that the expression level of StCCT7 was low in leaves and stems but significantly increased in tubers. Collectively, this study provided valuable information for the further study of potato formation and development and provided candidate genes for molecular breeding in the potato.

AB In recent years, photochemical organic conversion promoted by visible light has attracted the interest of many organic chemists. Compared with the traditional methods, visible light as the photocatalytic oxidation of renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool that can promote the activation of organic molecules through the single electron transfer (SET) process. Katritzky salt has been widely used in organic synthesis and drug preparation due to its convenient synthesis, easy availability of raw materials and high stability. These large Katritzky salts derived from amines can easily generate carbon radicals and conduct various organic conversion reactions. At present, this research has become an important research field of organic synthesis. This paper reviews the research results of coupling reactions of Carbon-Carbon bond formation involving visible light promoted Katritzky salts since 2020, and discusses representative examples and reaction mechanisms.

AB The role of language is one of the most critical elements in communicating COVID-19 public health mandates globally. This study aims to explore how Tibetans in the multilingual Kham region came to understand COVID-19 and develop health choices. To accomplish this goal, we used a culture-centered approach to examine how the words/phrases of COVID-19 influence Kham Tibetans' agency [the ability to develop actions (or lack thereof)] to work on the infectious disease and the pandemic management policy in China. This analysis explores the interactions among social structure, culture, and agency in the creation of transformative practices for negotiating the digital biomedical environment. Based on 30 in-depth interviews with Tibetans in the Kham region, we illustrate that the dialogical praxis to co-construct languages significantly impacts Tibetans' deliberate agency, the capacity to act that is conscious or intended, to work on COVID-19 and the pandemic-control policy.

TI In Situ Expression of Yak IL-22 in Mammary Glands as a Treatment

AB Since the development of dairy farming, bovine mastitis has been a problem plaguing the whole industry, which has led to a decrease in milk production, a reduction in dairy product quality, and an increase in costs. The use of antibiotics to treat mastitis can cause a series of problems, which can bring a series of harm to the animal itself, such as the development of bacterial resistance and dramatic changes in the gut flora. However, the in vivo and in vitro antibacterial activity of yak Interleukin-22 (IL-22) and its application in mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus have not been reported. In this study, the mammary gland-specific expression plasmid pLF-IL22 of the yak IL-22 gene was constructed and expressed in MAC-T cells and mammary tissue of postpartum female mice. The coding region of the IL-22 gene in yaks is 573 bp, which can encode 190 amino acids, and the homology difference in the IL-22 gene in yaks is less than 30%, which indicates certain conservation. IL-22 is a hydrophilic protein with a total positive charge of four, the presence of a signal peptide, and the absence of a transmembrane domain. Sufficient expression of IL-22 effectively inhibited the high expression of inflammatory factors caused by Staphylococcus aureus, reduced the symptoms of mammary gland histopathology, and alleviated mastitis. Under the action of IL-22, the intestinal flora of mastitis mice also changed, the abundance of intestinal Bacilli, Prevotellaceae, and Alloprevotella in mice increased after treatment, and the pathogenic bacteria decreased. These findings provide new insights into the potential application of the yak IL-22 gene in the treatment of bovine mastitis in the future.

AB The BiFeO3-BaTiO3 solid solution exhibits enhanced electric properties due to its modified phase structure with relaxor characteristics and reduced leakage current. Despite these advancements, the underlying mechanism behind the phase transition from a ferroelectric to a relaxor state in BF-BT ceramics remains largely unexplored. Here, the evolution of strain in (0.67 - x)BiFeO3-0.33BaTiO(3)-xBi(Mg0.5Zr0.5)O-3 ceramics is investigated, with a focus on the strain transition from a ferroelectric to a relaxor phase. A strengthening of relaxor behavior is observed in the modified rhombohedral (R) and pseudocubic (P-C) phase structure, resulting in optimal strain (S-uni = 0.25%, S-pos = 0.24%) at x = 0.04. The enhanced strain is attributed to the promotion of domain switching and the presence of strong random fields, with polar nanoregions integrating into a long-range ordered matrix. Furthermore, a gradual increase in strain with rising temperature is noted, driven by increased polarization and the expansion of ferroelectric domains. This study underscores the critical role of structural modifications in augmenting the electric response of BF-BT ceramics, thereby advancing the development of lead-free piezoelectric materials.

AB Avian reoviruses (ARVs) cause viral arthritis or tenosynovitis, resulting in poor weight gain and increased feed conversion ratios in chickens. In this study, we generated three Marek's disease virus (MDV) recombinants, namely, rMDV-ARV-sigma B, rMDV-ARV-sigma C, and rMDV-ARV-sigma B + C, expressing ARV sigma B, sigma C, and both sigma B and sigma C, respectively. In rMDV-ARV-sigma B and rMDV-ARV-sigma C, the sigma B or sigma C gene was inserted into the US2 gene of MDV vaccine strain 814 using a fosmid-based rescue system. In rMDV-ARV-sigma B + C, the sigma B and sigma C genes were cloned into different expression cassettes, which were co-inserted into the US2 gene of the MDV 814 strain. In infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), the recombinant virus rMDV-ARV-sigma B expressed sigma B, rMDV-ARV-sigma C expressed sigma C, and the rMDV-ARV-sigma B + C virus simultaneously expressed sigma B and sigma C. These recombinant viruses exhibited growth kinetics in CEFs similar to those of the parent MDV, and the inserted genes were stably maintained and expressed in the recombinant MDVs after 20 passages in cell cultures. These recombinant MDVs expressing sigma B and sigma C will provide potential vaccines against ARV infection in chickens.

AB Extensive industrial development in the Northeast Industrial District (NID) has led to significant resource depletion and ecological degradation, impacting both the target of peak carbon dioxide emissions for 2030 and the broader strategy for industrial green transformation (IGT) in China. In this context, this study explores the decision-support framework integrating the prediction model, cloud model, and gray relational model. Empirical results indicate that the optimized VBO-GM (1, 1) model reflects a superior capacity compared to the other prediction models, with mean absolute percentage error values consistently below 10% across all training datasets. According to the predictions of the optimal VBO-GM (1, 1) model, the IGT efficiency levels of the three provinces are expected to remain relatively low from 2021 to 2030. It highlights the significant challenges facing high-quality IGT in the NID region, characterized by a relatively lower proportion of cleaner energy and substantial industrial pollution emissions. Despite increases in innovation investment and R&D personnel inputs, improvements in outputs may be less than optimal due to inefficient conversion processes. Moreover, policymakers need to carefully balance innovation investment between internal and external R&D expenditures. This allocation is critical in formulating effective policies aimed at promoting sustainable industrial development and mitigating environmental impact.

AB Despite the pivotal role of stannum doping in achieving ultrahigh piezoelectric performance in barium titanate-based ceramics, the fundamental mechanisms underlying this enhancement remain elusive. Here, we introduce a single variable nonstoichiometric stannum strategy in lead-free barium titanate-based ceramics with giant piezoelectricity, revealing that stannum doping contributes intrinsically and extrinsically to enhance piezoelectricity. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the intrinsic enhancement of polarization arising from lattice distortion and increased space for titanium-oxygen bonds induced by optimal stannum doping, which is corroborated by Rayleigh analysis. A phase transition from ferroelectric multiphase coexistence to paraelectric phase is observed, alongside a rapid miniaturized and eventually disappeared domains with increasing stannum doping. This evolution in phase structure and domain configuration induces a nearly vanishing polarization anisotropy and low domain wall energy, facilitating easy polarization rotation and domain wall motion, thereby significantly contributing to the extrinsic piezoelectric response. Consequently, the origins of ultrahigh performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of stannum-induced intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in barium titanate-based ceramics. This study provides fundamental insights into the role of doping elements and offers guidance for the design of high-performance piezoelectrics.

AB The manipulation of the valley degree of freedom has attracted increasing attention in both fundamental scientific research and emerging applications. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the structural stability and electronic properties of Janus monolayers of VBXS2 (X=N, P). These materials exhibit characteristics of ferromagnetic semiconductors, with their valence band maximum located at the K/K ' point. Due to the combined effects of inversion symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking, VBNS2 and VBPS2 exhibit exotic spontaneous valley polarization in their top valence bands, measured at magnitudes of 48.6 meV and 47.6 meV, respectively. Consequently, this phenomenon potentially enables the observation of the anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). The unique electronic and valleytronic properties exhibited by Janus VBXS(2 )suggest a feasible experimental avenue for exploring ferrovalley (FV) and valley-related Hall effects within a two dimensional lattice.

AB The method of quantum dynamics is employed to investigate the mean strategy in the swarm intelligence algorithm. The physical significance of the population mean point is explained as the location where the optimal solution with the highest likelihood can be found once a quantum system has reached a ground state. Through the use of the double well function and the CEC2013 test suite, controlled experiments are conducted to perform a comprehensive performance analysis of the mean strategy. The empirical results indicate that implementing the mean strategy not only enhances solution diversity but also yields accurate, efficient, stable, and effective outcomes for finding the optimal solution.

AB The seeds of ginkgo biloba L (GB) have been widely used worldwide. This study investigated the bioefficacies of whole GB seed powder (WGP) retaining the full nutrients of ginkgo against aging, atherosclerosis, and fatigue. The experimental results indicated that WGP lowered brain monoamine oxidase and serum malondialdehyde levels, enhanced thymus/spleen indexes, and improved learning ability, and delayed aging in senescent mice. WGP regulated lipid levels and prevented atherosclerosis by reducing triglycerides, lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and decreasing the atherosclerosis index. WGP improved exercise performance by reducing blood lactate accumulation and extending exhaustive swimming and climbing times, improved energy storage by increasing muscle/liver glycogen levels, and relieved physical fatigue. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 270 potential targets of WGP that play roles in cellular pathways related to inflammation inhibition, metabolism regulation, and anti-cellular senescence, etc. Protein-protein interaction analysis identified 10 hub genes, including FOS, ESR1, MAPK8, and SP1 targets. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the bioactive compounds of WGP bound well to the targets. This study suggests that WGP exerts prominent health-promoting effects through multiple components, targets, and pathways.

AB In the modern logistics industry, digital prediction technologies have the potential to optimize logistics distribution. Historical data is a rich source of prior knowledge. This paper proposes a Route Prediction method based on Historical trajectory data analysis (RPH), which addresses the challenge of real-time route prediction for moving objects in a complex and dynamic traffic flow, as well as user behavior. The RPH method applies the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster historical GPS coordinate points and construct a road network. Then, it establishes the travel time distribution of road segments based on the variance and gradient of historical travel time. Subsequently, the Bayesian estimation method is employed to estimate users' travel times of road segments at different time slots. Ultimately, the method uses transition information entropy to select suitable road segments, generating the predicted route for the user. Furthermore, the RPH periodically updates the road network and travel times to enhance the accuracy of the prediction. Simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our method. The results show that our method outperforms competing prediction methods, exhibiting a higher hit rate, lower prediction error, and reasonable time cost.

AB This paper investigates the synchronization problem of delayed neural networks (DNNs). First, we introduce an intelligent hybrid event-triggered scheme (IHETS) that allows sensors to wait within a specified time range after triggering measurements, thereby reducing network load and avoiding Zeno behavior. Then, a semi-looped-functional approach with relaxed constraints is adopted, which eliminates the need for strict requirements on negative definite derivatives. Moreover, we introduce a novel series of less conservative linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to guarantee sufficient conditions for the existence of asymptotic synchronization controllers, considering practical engineering factors such as actuator failures. Finally, the effectiveness of this approach is validated through a numerical example.

TI Twin support vector regression for characterizing uncertainty in surface
   reconstruction
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Surface reconstruction plays a pivotal role in various fields, including reverse engineering, and oil and gas exploration. However, errors in available data and insufficient surface morphology information often introduce uncertainty into the reconstruction. It is crucial to accurately characterize and visualize the uncertainty in surface reconstruction for risk analysis and planning further data collection. To this end, this paper proposes an uncertainty characterization method based on twin support vector regression. First, various modeling data are effectively integrated and the information contained in the high-confidence sample is efficiently utilized through the uncertainty interval generated by quantiles and upper/lower bound constraints. Second, well-path points are incorporated by imposing inequality constraints on the corresponding prediction points. Finally, in order to reduce computation time, the problem of uncertainty characterization is formulated as two smaller-scale quadratic programming. The results obtained from a real fault dataset and a synthetic dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. When well data are available, the generated uncertainty envelopes are constrained by well data, which can partially mitigate reconstruction uncertainties.

AB The alpine grasslands of the Qiangtang Plateau face significant ecological risks due to extensive human activities, particularly in areas along lakeshores and riverbanks, where overgrazing has caused severe degradation and salinization of the grasslands. Conducting fieldwork in such environments presents significant challenges for long-term community-scale landscape ecological research. In this study, the habitat characteristics of dominant plant communities in the alpine basin of Zhari Namco were quantified from three perspectives: topography, hydrology, and fractional vegetation cover. Using Aster GDEM and Landsat imagery, five grassland types were mapped for 2001-2021. Based on the spatial variables of area, shape, and distance, 13 landscape indices were selected to observe spatiotemporal changes. The results revealed several key findings: (1) The patch structure of the zonal vegetation Stipa purpurea steppe has undergone a pattern of dispersion-aggregation-dispersion in the past 20 years, yet the core habitat area remains unchanged by more than 52%, indicating fundamental stability in the southern Qiangtang alpine grassland; (2) Using the minimally grazed Kobresia pygmaea meadow as a reference, other communities exhibit stability similar to or approaching it, but with significant differences in aggregation level. The gradual expansion of grazing and economic activities has been a driving factor; and (3) Water conservation projects have diversified the use of water resources in river and lakeside habitats. Stipa purpurea + Carex moorcroftii steppe and Carex swamp meadow exhibit optimal carrying capacity, making them the only areas with relatively high sustainability. The study underscores that the current ecological benefits are a result of effective management. However, without proper management, the region could trend towards landscape fragmentation, becoming the most vulnerable zone in the watershed. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen retrospective analysis of grazing intensity and trend analysis of habitat changes to provide a scientific basis for local economic development and grazing management.
   Alpine habitats determine the distribution of dominant plant communities and the topography, hydrology and FVC improve the quality of plant community identification in the southern Qiangtang alpine grassland. Stipa purpurea + Carex moorcroftii steppe and Carex swamp meadow exhibit optimal carrying capacity, making them the only areas with relatively high sustainability. However, without proper management, the region could trend towards landscape fragmentation, becoming the most vulnerable zone in the watershed. image

AB We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate neurological toxicities with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) in cancer patients. Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1 January 2000 to 1 November 2023. Forty-six RCTs and 9529 patients were included. PARPis could increase the risk of all-grade headache [risk ratio (RR), 1.22; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.14-1.30; P < 0.00001], dizziness (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.53; P < 0.00001), dysgeusia (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.44-2.60; P < 0.0001) and insomnia (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.09-1.60; P < 0.0001) in cancer patients. Headache was the most common neurological toxicity. Niraparib was associated with a higher risk of headache and insomnia, talazoparib with a higher risk of dizziness and rucaparib with a higher risk of dysgeusia. Breast cancer patients receiving PARPis have a higher risk of dysgeusia, while ovarian cancer patients are at an increased risk of insomnia. PARPis may increase the risk of mild to moderate neurological toxicities, but not severe ones.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB In this paper, we focus on the automated diagnosis of physiological curvature in the cervical spine, with an emphasis on feature point localization. Cervical spine deformity is prevalent, and the Cobb angle is widely recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing and treating it. However, manual measurement is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and heavily reliant on clinical experience. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a high-precision automatically detecting algorithm to meet the clinical requirements of orthopedic surgeons. Traditional methods are constrained by complex steps and limited data, which pose challenges. Therefore, we propose an efficient framework that formulates an automatic diagnosis of cervical spine physiological curvature based on a novel deep neural network. By leveraging the excellent properties of neural memory Ordinary Differential Equation (nmODE) in long-term memory retention and nonlinear representation capabilities, we effectively improve the network's performance in keypoint detection branching tasks. Additionally, we integrate a novel hybrid transformer based on residual structures and a multi-stage dilated dynamic convolution to alleviate false detections caused by X-ray obstruction and shadows, and the integration also captures the relationship between vertebrae and landmarks to compensate for the lack of detailed information. We constructed a dataset named CSL-947X, comprising 947 cervical spine lateral X-ray images of patients to train and evaluate our proposed model. Extensive experiments on CSL-947X demonstrate that our framework achieves higher accuracy and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and its potential feasibility as a clinical decision-making tool for healthcare professionals.

AB BackgroundEthnic socialisation plays a vital role in the development of ethnic minority adolescents. However, the generalizability of research findings beyond the context of immigrant societies in the United States remains unclear.MethodsUtilising a person-centred approach, this study analysed a sample of 2,600 ethnic minority adolescents in China (55.8% female, Mage = 14.93 +/- 1.82) to explore ethnic socialisation patterns, and their correlations with depression.ResultsLatent profile analysis revealed four distinct ethnic socialisation profiles: low-frequency, moderate-frequency, high-frequency and proactive integration orientation. Adolescents with the high-frequency profile displayed the highest levels of depression, followed by those with the moderate-frequency profile, whereas adolescents with the low-frequency and proactive integration orientation profiles showed a lower risk of depression.ConclusionsWithin the sociocultural context of China, ethnic minority families' ethnic socialisation practices demonstrate unique characteristics. Various ethnic socialisation messages are integrated in diverse patterns to exert influence on adolescents.

AB . This study examines the relationship between reputational threat and altruistic behavior in children aged 6-11 and explores how social inhibition and group relationships affect this behavior. Study 1 involved 204 children and found that age and reputational threat influence altruism, with age 8 being a key turning point. Study 2 focused on 130 nine-year-olds and showed that children with low social inhibition engage in more altruistic acts, regardless of reputational threat. Study 3, with 151 participants, analyzed the effects of group dynamics based on left-behind status. Non-left-behind children preferred out-group altruism, while left-behind children showed in-group preference under reputational threat, with no difference in its absence. Left-behind children were generally more altruistic. The findings highlight age 8 as crucial for reputation strategies and suggest that reputational threat, social inhibition, and group dynamics shape altruistic behavior. This research offers insights into the positive qualities of left-behind children, informing their development and education.

AB Building thermal design optimization is pivotal for energy efficiency and built environment improvement. The optimal thermophysical properties for building walls remain ambiguous. This ambiguity stems from the constraints of traditional building physics, which: (1) disjoins the enhancement of wall thermal performance from the building service system management; and (2) relies on the forward method that fails to identify the ideal variable thermophysical property, the solution to which is inherently a function. This study elucidates the optimal temperature-dependent volumetric specific heat $\lpar \rho c_p\lpar t \rpar \rpar$(rho cp(t)) and thermal conductivity $\lpar k\lpar t \rpar \rpar$(k(t)) through the inverse problem and variation method. Illustrative example indicates that the optimal $\rho c_p\lpar t \rpar$rho cp(t) closely resembles a combination of two '$\delta$delta' functions, while the optimal $k\lpar t \rpar$k(t) mirrors a square wave function. Utilizing these ideal thermophysical properties, the building energy consumption can be significantly reduced by 77.1% with the optimized $\rho c_p\lpar t \rpar$rho cp(t) and 79.9% with the optimized $k\lpar t \rpar$k(t). The ideal thermophysical properties for active buildings differ significantly from those recommended for passive buildings, underscoring that minimal energy consumption does not necessarily imply minimal discomfort. Therefore, the thermophysical properties of active and passive buildings should be optimized distinctly. This research offers valuable insights for defining ideal thermophysical properties of active building walls and construction materials.

AB Background: Mesangial cell (MC)-mediated immune inflammatory injury is a basic pathological process in glomerulonephritis. However, due to the limited drug accumulation and serious adverse effects, it remains challenging to explore a rational delivery system integrating high efficiency and low toxicity to deliver antiinflammatory drugs to the glomerular MC region. Results: Salvianolic acid B (SAB)-loaded hybrid membrane biomimetic nanovesicles (SAB@HMVs) were developed by fusing erythrocyte membrane nanovesicles with mesenchymal stem cells biomimetic membrane nanovesicles. SAB@HMVs had a spheroidal structure, low cytotoxicity, particle size of 143.83 + 1.33 nm and exhibited a high drug loading capacity (7.02 %+0.30 %) along with a good sustained release function. The in vitro anti-inflammatory results revealed that HMVs were effectively taken up by MCs and showed significant antiinflammatory activity. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies revealed that SAB@HMVs could deliver SAB to kidney tissue and elicit an effective anti-inflammatory response to improve the pathological changes in the glomerular mesangial region, significantly reducing the levels of cytokines and alleviating kidney inflammation. Especially, noteworthy was the observation that SAB@HMVs augmented the renal delivery of SAB, downregulated the gene expression of p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B, inhibited the levels of MMP9 and TNF-alpha proteins as well as elevated the level of i kappa B protein, indicating that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SAB@HMVs should be based on regulating MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. Conclusion: We provided a novel strategy to increase nanovesicles accumulation in MCs with the potential to exert anti-inflammatory regulatory effects in glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, this biomimetic hybrid membrane loaded with pure drugs may offer a functional platform to address multiple clinical needs.

AB Purpose Most forms of Mercury (Hg) in soil have significant destructive effect on ecosystems and food safety because of enormous toxicity. The existing treatment methods have drawbacks such as high energy consumption, complex operation, long remediation cycle, and secondary pollution. Therefore, this study aims to develop a governance method with low energy consumption, simple operation, short execution cycle, and no secondary pollution. Methods A new system was set up to remove leachable Hg2+ from soil and its performance was evaluated. The system consisted of photochemical vapor generator (PVG, for Hg2+ removal), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) trapping reactor (for collection of removed Hg-0). In the presence of organic acids, leachable Hg2+ was converted to gaseous Hg-0 by UV irradiation in the PVG, and transported to the DBD trap by air for collection of the removed Hg2+. Soil samples in PVG were taken into glass tubes at specific time and then added aqua regia, analyzed using ICP-MS after digested in a boiling water bath. The performance of DBD trap was analyzed by connecting with ICP-MS. Results This study achieved the removal of leachable Hg2+ from soil under the UV excitation, the subsequent conversion of escaped gaseous Hg-0 to solid and enrichment in DBD trap. The factors affecting the efficiencies of photochemical reaction, transport and collection were carefully investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the removal efficiency of 2.00 mg L-1 leachable Hg2+ in soil reached 95.0% within 1 h. Even in the presence of 15 interfering ions separately containing 50 mg L-1, good remediation effects can still be achieved. The capture rate of gaseous Hg-0 by DBD trap is close to 100%. The system can achieve Hg pollution control in 10 types of soil, demonstrating great promotion value. Conclusions This system utilizes PVG theory and DBD low-temperature plasma device to construct a safe, green, simple, and inexpensive method for removing leachable Hg2+ from soil.

AB The western region of Sichuan Province, located in the Hengduan Mountains, is one of China's most seismically active zones. Due to limited land resources, many villages in western Sichuan Province are situated in mountainous and valley areas, facing harsh climatic conditions, lagging economic development, and insufficient infrastructure. After experiencing seismic disasters, these villages often encounter challenges, such as cut-off mountain roads, difficulties in delivering relief supplies, and sharply a significant drop in nighttime temperatures due to the high-altitude climate. Consequently, in the case of the economic underdevelopment and limited resources, how to repurpose existing buildings for disaster relief has become a crucial issue for disaster prevention and mitigation in these villages. This paper takes Ganbao Tibetan Village, located in the alpine gorge regions of western Sichuan Province, as a case study. It evaluates the interior space utilization status of different types of existing public buildings during disasters, calculates the effective utilization rate of interior space disaster reduction conversion based on the spatial layout model, and extracts the typical interior space dimensions that are conducive to disaster relief and conversion of public buildings based on the interior space utilization characteristics of disaster relief. This study provides a reference for the design of public service buildings considering the requirements of disaster resilience transformation.

AB The present study aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship between social inhibition and behavior problems in preschoolers, as well as the potential moderating role of maternal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) in this relationship. A total of 196 preschoolers aged 3-4 years (MT1 = 3.460, SD = .594) and their mothers participated in the study, which involved two-time points. Specifically, teachers assessed preschoolers' social inhibition at the first time point (November 2018). After 1 year (November 2019), mothers reported parenting styles and preschoolers' behavior problems. The results revealed that higher levels of social inhibition were positively associated with increased behavior problems in preschoolers. Furthermore, it was found that a high maternal authoritative parenting style buffered the positive association between social inhibition and preschoolers' behavior problems. However, maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting styles did not act as moderators. These findings emphasized the importance of maternal authoritative parenting style for behavior problems in preschoolers with social inhibition.

AB Eleutherococcus giraldii (Harms) Nakai (EG, thereafter) is a perennial shrub, widely recognized for its medicinal properties. The stem bark of this plant is a widely used traditional Chinese herb with the effects of dispelling dampness, strengthening sinews and invigorating bones. Native to the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, EG is a prevalent Qiang medicine. It was included in the 2010 Edition of the Standard of Traditional Chinese Medicines of Sichuan Province. In the 1990s, numerous phytochemistry was carried out. Several chemical constituents have been identified, including saponins, lignans, alkali nucleosides, polysaccharides, alkanes, organic acids, and other compounds. Notably, glycosides and their glycosides with ivy saponins as ligands stand out among these constituents. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the stem bark of Eleutherococcus giraldii (Harms) Nakai (EGSB, thereafter) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumour, anti-oxidant, anti-ischemic and hepatoprotective effects. In addition to its stem bark being used in medicine, the young leaves of EG are the traditional food of the Qiang people, which has been developed into a tea product and pushed to the market. The prospect of industrialisation is good. This comprehensive review aims to explore the taxonomic status, botanical characteristics, traditional applications, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and quality control of EG. The primary focus is placed on phytochemical and pharmacological investigations.

ID COMPONENT
AB The collocation of a monosyllable and a disyllable stands as a distinctive prosodic feature of Chinese. Whether rhythm is the decisive factor for acceptability of the collocation is still controversial in Chinese linguistics. This study has investigated this issue by exploring the influence of rhythmic patterns (2 + 1 disyllable + monosyllable vs. 1 + 2 monosyllable + disyllable) on the reading of Chinese noun -noun compounds (NN compounds) through an eventrelated potential (ERP) experiment. We found that, in terms of behavioral data, rhythmic patterns exerted a distinct meaning -modulating effect, namely, the abnormal rhythmic pattern (1 + 2) tends to reduce the semantic acceptability of NN compounds. ERP data showed that, the normal rhythmic pattern (2 + 1) elicited a larger N100 component than the abnormal one in semantically incongruent conditions; a rhythm -modulated N400 component was followed by a later positive component (LPC) associated with the re -analysis of compounds. Both behavioral and ERP data revealed a greater cognitive effort required to process NN compounds when semantics and rhythm were incongruent. These findings indicate that rhythmic patterns and semantics interactively affect the reading processing of Chinese NN compounds, and that rhythmic expectations may prevail in the semantic processing of Chinese compounds.

AB A novel fluorescence enhancement type probe 2-(1, 3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-5-(diethylamino)phenyl thiophene-2-carboxylate (PTN) for the detection of hydrazine (N2H4) was designed and synthesised. The fluorescence of the probe PTN solution increased dramatically upon the addition of N2H4 and its appearance changed from nearly colourless to dazzling blue. The simple structure and readily available fluorescent probe provide a novel approach for the quantitative detection of N2H4 in the linear range from 0 to 37.5 mu M, with a detection limit down to 56 nM, fast response (within 5 min), strong anti-interference ability, easy operation (test paper), and a wide range of pH from 6 to 10. Furthermore, the probe PTN was able to detect N2H4 in actual water samples and image the exogenous N2H4 signal in colorimetric test strips and living zebrafish.

Nervosine VII (3) exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC of 62.5 mu g/mL and inhibited the proliferation of human T cells with an IC50 value of 9.67 +/- 0.96 mu M. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential pharmacological properties of these compounds.

AB The ALDH1A1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, which plays an important role in regulating animal reproductive performance, including estrus cycle and embryonic development. The aim of this study was to characterize ALDH1A1 activity in ovaries of 3-5 year-old yaks and to determine its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and progesterone secretion in luteal cells (LCs). The coding sequence (CDS) of the ALDH1A1 gene was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis was used to confirm localization of the ALDH1A1 protein in the ovary. To assess the activity of ALDH1A1 in regulating progesterone secretion, si-ALDH1A1 was transfected into LCs in vitro and progesterone levels in LC supernatants were measured by ELISA. The interference efficiency was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence staining, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by EdU and TUNEL staining, respectively. The cloned ALDH1A1 sequence contained 1462 bp, encoding 487 amino acids. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that ALDH1A1 protein expression, which was significantly higher in LCs, was mainly found in antral follicles and the corpus luteum (CL). The expression of ALDH1A1 mRNA in LCs was effectively inhibited by si-ALDH1A1transfection, and progesterone secretion was markedly decreased along with the significant down-regulation of progesterone pathway-related genes, STAR, CYP11A1, CYP19A1, CYP17A1, 3 beta-HSD, and HSD17B1. Knockdown of ALDH1A1 mRNA expression decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in LCs. The mRNA expression of the proliferation-related genes, PCNA, CCND1, CCNB1 and CDC25A, was significantly down-regulated, while expression of the apoptosis-promoting CASP3 gene was significantly increased. In summary, we characterized the yak ALDH1A1 gene and revealed that ALDH1A1 knockdown promoted apoptosis, repressed cell proliferation, and decreased progesterone secretion by yak LCs, potentially by regulating the mRNA expression of genes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and progesterone synthesis and secretion.

AB With the continuous development of rural revitalization and urbanization in China, the sustainable transformation of traditional rural architecture has become increasingly important. This study takes the Thangka exhibition hall in rural Malkang, Sichuan Province, as the research object and proposes a Thangka exhibition hall architectural design centered around solar heating and aiming for near-zero energy consumption. The research method involves establishing a solar energy system model on the roof of the exhibition hall and utilizing solar angle and area calculation formulas along with simulation software to calculate the optimal installation angle and area of solar panels, with the aim of achieving indoor temperatures that meet Thangka protection requirements while achieving zero-energy heating. Preliminary results indicate that this solar-centric near-zero energy architectural design can effectively promote the increase in indoor temperature through solar thermal conversion. Additionally, through calculation and simulation, the optimal installation angle for the solar panels achieving zero-energy heating is determined to be 24.25 with an azimuth angle of -1.2. The optimum installation area for solar panels is 8.2 square meters in the showroom and 2.7 square meters in the storeroom. Among these, the solar panel area for the Thangka exhibition hall constitutes 4.12% of the total area and is required for maintaining Thangka protection temperature requirements throughout the year, while the solar panel area for the storage room constitutes 1.88% and is also needed for the same purpose. Studying the optimal installation angle and area of solar panels can transform the exhibition hall into a near-zero-energy building, meeting the temperature requirements for Thangka preservation and human thermal comfort, while also achieving optimal economic benefits. This provides guidance and a reference for promoting near-zero-energy buildings in rural areas.

AB Metal-metal (hydr)oxide interfaces can promote the CO2 selectivity of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) due to so-called metal-oxide interaction (MOI). Here, we first show that the mixture of Ir and PbO species at the nanoscale can also form "bifunctional effect" sites, where the C-C bond of ethanol can be effectively cut at Ir sites to generate C1 intermediates, and nearby PbO species could provide oxygenated species. The as-prepared Ir-PbO/C catalysts with a mean metallic nanoparticle size of 2.6 +/- 0.5 nm can greatly improve the activity, stability, and C1 pathway selectivity of EOR. Specifically, it exhibits superior mass activity of 1150 mA/mg(Ir) in 1 M NaOH solution containing 1 M C2H5OH. Chronoamperometry tests show that the stability of Ir-PbO/C is also significantly improved compared with Ir/C. In situ electrochemical infrared absorption spectral results confirm that the addition of oxophilic PbO species could accelerate the oxidative removal of COad intermediates, thereby greatly improving catalytic performance. This study may give new insights into designing efficient anode catalysts for the direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs).

AB In many fields such as finance and electrical load, locally weighted support vector regression (LWSVR) method can achieve better prediction results by constructing different sub-models for each prediction target. However, it selected a fixed and single nearest neighbor parameter of k global for each query, and adopted the traditional k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, which is suboptimal. The weights in LWSVR assigned to the neighboring sample points also affected the accuracy of the model predictions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive locally weighted support vector regression with asymmetrically parametric insensitive/margin model, called Asy-par-v-ALWSVR. Since the selection of similar sample for query points is significant. We propose a novel locally q-neighbour selection algorithm that adaptively selects the most suitable number of neighbours for each query point based on Mahalanobis distance, rather than using a fixed k global . This significantly improves prediction accuracy. The weights of neighbours for each query point in Asy-par-v-ALWSVR is based on the distance within the kernel-induced feature space. This effectively discerns the importance of samples during the training process. In particular, Asy-par-v-ALWSVR can handle skewed noise with heteroscedastic structure in regression problems. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on a synthetic sinc dataset and 14 real datasets. The results demonstrate that Asy-par-v-ALWSVR outperforms six state-of-the-art SVR-based models.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), an important viral disease of swine caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) was first confirmed in Nepal in 2013. Since then, the virus has spread throughout the country and has now become endemic affecting the pig production nationally. However, molecular characterization of circulating strains has not been done in Nepal yet. In the present study, serum samples were collected from outbreak areas of different districts of Nepal and samples positive for PRRSV by ELISA were sent to Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), United Kingdom for sequence analysis. Out of 35 samples that were sent to APHA, only one sample was found positive by PCR and subjected to sequence analysis based on ORF5, ORF7 and Nsp2. The results from the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the PRRSV strain belongs to PRRSV-2 and lineage 8 strain. The sequences from the Nepalese PRRSV strain revealed a high degree of similarity with the strains isolated from India, China and Vietnam, with the closest genetic relatedness to the Indian isolates from 2020 and 2018. This is the first study on molecular characterization of PRRS virus circulating in Nepal. Further studies on strains circulating in Nepal are very essential to understand the virus diversity, its spread and evolution.

AB In recent years, neural operators have shown great advantages in solving partial differential equations by learning mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel neural operator network to further improve the efficiency of operator learning from parameter space to solution space. We introduce Dual-view block in the architecture, which can better extract and fuse potential features under different visual fields. In addition, we also introduce the homeomorphic mapping and parameterized integration kernels directly in Fourier space, which is beneficial to capturing the specific frequency information required during function iteration. The test results on the standard benchmark (Representative Partial Differential Equations Benchmark) demonstrate that our neural operator not only has better accuracy than the baseline but also has a huge advantage in inference speed. In summary, we provide a new option for using data-driven machine learning methods to solve partial differential equations quickly, robustly, and accurately.

AB It of great importance in assessing built thermal environment level and evaluating corresponding indoor air conditioning demand for energy conservation in construction sectors. Nevertheless, because of the unique meteorological features in plateau area, classical building performance simulation approach contributes to thermal performance evaluation errors since most design codes or standards relies on low attitude regions. In this paper, a modified and improved dynamic thermal design model is put forward for built environment and energy consumption estimation for passive buildings for plateau buildings. Moreover, the simplified experiment is set up to monitor dynamic thermal responses for modelling building. The testing validation illustrate that the onsite measurement accuracy level is quite acceptable for engineering applications with less than 30% relative change range coefficient. Besides, the experiment data demonstrates that window-to-wall ratios, architectural orientation, thermal insulation coefficients, have substantial impacts for solar heat gains in plateau buildings. The study renders building design guidance for energy conservation in high altitude plateau areas.

AB According to ancient Chinese books, bear grease has the effects of strengthening muscles and bones, which is beneficial for weakness, but there is relatively little research on it. Thus, the extraction of it is beneficial for compensating for research in this area. In this study, a uniform experimental design method was used to optimize the extraction process of bear grease by enzymatic hydrolysis extraction, and the extraction rate can reach 81.89% under optimized extraction conditions. Furthermore, the components of bear grease obtained by this study were analyzed by GC-MS, and the results showed that ursolic oil was rich in unsaturated fatty acids (67.51%), which was higher than that of the traditional method (66.92%). The composition of bear grease extracted by the enzymatic method was also better than that extracted by the traditional method. In addition, bear grease obtained in this study had the obvious activity of promoting hair growth. The length, weight, and number of hair follicles in the depilation area of mice in the high-dose group were significantly different from those in the blank group (p < 0.01). This study optimized the extraction process of bear grease and conducted a preliminary analysis of its fatty acid composition, which is expected to provide some reference for the development of the medicinal value of bear grease.

ID BEHAVIORAL HETEROGENEITY; TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
AB The kinetic theory is employed to study the changes in the amount of wealth invested in two types of risky assets when investors switch their trading strategies. Investors in the market are assumed to possess nonnegative wealth and opt to allocate a portion of their wealth into two types of risky assets. A Boltzmann model, which includes strategy switching and interaction probability, is utilized to investigate the evolution of the amount of wealth invested in risky assets and the number of investors using fundamentalist and chartist strategies. We employ the asymptotic procedure method to derive the Fokker-Planck equations from the Boltzmann model. The resulting stationary solution of these equations sheds light on the effects of strategy switching on the evolution of the amount of wealth invested in risky assets, as well as how investor interactions influence the number of investors employing different strategies.

AB Graph-based classification techniques applied to neuroimaging data have played a pivotal role in advancing our comprehension of brain functionalities. Existing graph-based classification methods primarily focus on undirected networks. However, networks derived from neuroimaging data often exhibit a directed nature. In this study, we propose an innovative asymmetric bilinear logistic regression (ABLR) approach to tackle binary classification tasks in weighted directed networks. This general framework is achieved by incorporating the directional flow information of edge sending and receiving. Simultaneously, the loss function is equipped with regularization penalties. This way, our method can identify predictive nodes sparsely and generate meaningful interpretations. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an efficient proximal linear block coordinate descent (prox-linear BCD) algorithm, which is proved to have a global convergence property. Through simulations and electroencephalogram(EEG)-derived brain network application, our proposed classification method outperforms the alternative method. The ABLR method not only achieves higher classification accuracy but also provides stronger interpretability.

AB Pasteurella multocida, a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen, is renowned for causing diverse respiratory tract diseases in animals. In the quest for on-site detection solutions, we developed a rapid insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) assay, targeting the sodA gene specific to Pasteurella multocida. This assay demonstrated remarkable specificity by successfully detecting clinical isolates of Pasteurella multocida types A, B, and D, while maintaining negative results for various other pathogens. Its robust sensitivity was evident in detecting positive strain DNA (2.03 copies/mu L) and colonies (1.36x10(3) CFU/mL) as templates, with positive results for undiluted positive samples. The iiPCR method showed exceptional repeatability in triplicate detections of various diluted positive strains. In practical testing, encompassing 188 clinical nasal swab samples from goats, the iiPCR assay performed comparably to a reference PCR, underscoring its accuracy and reliability for on-site Pasteurella multocida detection in veterinary diagnostics.

AB Background: Gouty arthritis (GA) is a common form of inflammatory arthritis caused by intra-articular deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals; however, there is a tremendous lack of safe and effective therapy in the clinic.
   Objective: The goal of this work was to investigate a novel leflunomide analogue, N-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl-1,2-oxazole-3-carboxamide (UTLOH-4e), for its potential to prevent/ treat gouty arthritis.
   Methods: In this study, the anti-inflammatory activity of UTLOH-4e was evaluated by MSU-induced GA model in vivo and in vitro, and the molecular docking test was applied to estimate the affinity of UTLOH-4e/UTL-5g/b for MAPKs, NF-kappa B, and NLRP3.
   Results: In vitro, UTLOH-4e (1 similar to 100 mu M) treatment inhibited the inflammatory reaction with no obvious cytotoxicity in PMA-induced THP-1 macrophages exposed to MSU crystals for 24 h, involving the prominent decreased production and gene expression of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Western blot analyses demonstrated that UTLOH-4e (1 similar to 100 mu M) significantly suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, NF-kappa B, and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, the data from the experiment on gouty rats induced by intra-articular injection of MSU crystal confirmed that UTLOH-4e markedly ameliorated rat paw swelling, articular synovium inflammation and reduced the concentration of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in serum through down-regulating NLRP3 protein expression.
   Conclusion: These results manifested that UTLOH-4e ameliorates GA induced by MSU crystals, which contributes to the modulation of NF-kappa B/ NLRP3 signaling pathway, suggesting that UTLOH- 4e is a promising and potent drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of gouty arthritis.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and its mitigation is a pressing task in the coming decade. However, it remains unclear which specific process between concurrent nitrification and denitrification dominates worldwide N2O emission. We snagged an opportunity to ascertain whence the N2O came and which were the controlling factors on the basis of 1315 soil N2O observations from 74 peer-reviewed articles. The average N2O emission derived from nitrification (N2On) was higher than that from denitrification (N2Od) worldwide. The ratios of nitrification-derived N2O to denitrification-derived N2O, hereof N2On:N2Od, exhibited large variations across terrestrial ecosystems. Although soil carbon and nitrogen content, pH, moisture, and clay content accounted for a part of the geographical variations in the N2On:N2Od ratio, ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM):denitrifier ratio was the pivotal driver for the N2On:N2Od ratios, since the AOM:denitrfier ratio accounted for 53.7% of geographical variations in N2On:N2Od ratios. Compared with natural ecosystems, soil pH exerted a more remarkable role to dictate the N2On:N2Od ratio in croplands. This study emphasizes the vital role of functional soil microorganisms in geographical variations of N2On:N2Od ratio and lays the foundation for the incorporation of soil AOM:denitrfier ratio into models to better predict N2On:N2Od ratio. Identifying soil N2O derivation will provide a global potential benchmark for N2O mitigation by manipulating the nitrification or denitrification.

DT Article
DE Timothy Richard; Looking Backward; Productive and Non-Productive Labor;
   The Historical Evidences of Christianity
AB The present article is a function-oriented case study within the framework of Descriptive Translation Studies, as developed by Gideon Toury, which posits translations as facts in the target culture where they interact with other works and influence them. The present article argues that a translation can have an impact on its translator whose relationship with the target culture is ambivalent. The British missionary Timothy Richard and his Chinese translation of Looking Backward is the case under investigation. Richard played multiple roles in late Qing China. He was a reformer as well as a missionary. His translation of Looking Backward influenced his own reform ideas, which in turn influenced the reformists in late Qing China.

AB This work is devoted to the analysis for a new class of set-valued inverse mixed variational inequalities (SIMVIs) in reflexive Banach spaces, when both the mapping and the constraint set are perturbed simultaneously by two parameters. Several equivalence characterizations are given for SIMVIs to have nonempty and bounded solution sets. Based on the equivalence conditions, under the premise of monotone mappings, the stability result for the SIMVIs is obtained in the reflexive Banach space. Furthermore, to illustrate the results, an example of the traffic network equilibrium control problem is provided at the end of this paper. The results presented in this paper generalize and extend some known results in this area.

AB Urban scenescapes are significantly influenced by cultural groups representing different ethnicities. In order to foster a cohesive and inclusive urban environment, it is crucial to comprehend the scale, type, and distribution of scenes associated with ethnicity. With the aim of exploring Tibetan cultural scenescapes in Chinese cities, this study employed the theory of scenes to develop a socio-spatial research method. By focusing on the five downtown districts of Chengdu as the study area, the study evaluated the effectiveness of urban facilities in expressing Tibetan culture and delineated the scenescapes related to Tibetan ethnicity in the designated region. This study's findings indicate the following: 1) different urban facilities exhibited notable variation in their cultural performance; 2) currently, seven distinct scene clusters showcase Tibetan culture in downtown Chengdu; 3) these scene clusters can be categorised into three types. Based on the findings, this study has proposed strategies for planning scene clusters and designing facilities, with the overarching objective of fostering an inclusive and multicultural urban environment.

SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Air quality; Linear regression; Meteorological influence; Pollutant
   concentration; Timescale
AB Due to the rapid urbanization and climate change, one of the pressing problems confronting Chinese cities lies in air pollution. Especially during recent years, most cosmopolitan cities in China suffer from thick smog caused by PMs. It is reported that such air pollution has close relations with traffic-related pollutants, such as NO2. Meteorological condition contributes significantly to long-range transport sources and has remarkable influences on the distribution of the above pollutants. Thus, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze such influential patterns. In this paper, taking Chengdu as an illustrative example, the meteorological and pollutant statistics in 4947 h are collected and fitted with 8 meteorological parameters of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 through linear regression method. And data is analyzed and compared on the hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly basis, respectively. Results show that hourly and daily data focus on fluctuations that affected by multiple interferences other than meteorological influences. When hourly values of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exceed 175 mu g/m3, 250 mu g/m3, and 125 mu g/m3, respectively, discrete values that cannot be explained by meteorological influences increase notably, while weekly and monthly variations illustrate more tendencies, and communicable patterns that decisively influenced by meteorology can be extracted among 3 pollutants. By comparing the results in 4 timescales, respectively, similar principal meteorological factors are involved in fitting processes. Thirdly, visibility (V), wind speed (WS), precipitation (P), and cloud condition (CC) are the most influential factors and served as main parameters in linear regressions within 4 timescales. Air temperature (AT) and dew temperature (DT) are less influential factors by daily and weekly data but are served as main parameters when it goes to hourly and monthly data and function as variables that signify tendency variances in linear regressions, while relative humidity (RH) and barometric pressure (BP) are lest influential factors and have limited effect on fitting results. This work can provide guidance and reference for urban planning optimization and air environment protection in cities with air quality control considerations impacted by local climatic conditions.

DE Canariomyces microsporus; hulless barley; leaf spot
AB From September 2021 to September 2022, leaf spots appeared in hulless barley seedlings in the experimental field of Qinghai University (36 degrees 62 ' N, 101 degrees 77 ' E) with an incidence of 35%-60%. In this study, four diseased samples were collected from different experimental sites at Qinghai University for analysis. Moreover, four strains with the same colony and microscopic morphology were isolated. A representative QK-1 strain was used for DNA extraction and sequencing via PCR amplification using a multi-gene phylogenetic analysis (ITS, tub2 and EF-1 alpha). BLAST search revealed that ITS, tub2 and EF-1 alpha sequence shared 99.59% (accession MH860852), 98.97% (MK926899) and 95.37% (MN078437) nucleotide sequence similarity with isolate CBS276.74 of C. microsporus. The fungus that caused leaf spot of the hulless barley was then identified as Canariomyces microspores. Similar symptoms were observed on hulless barley seedlings after control inoculation with the QK-1 strain, consistent with the Koch's hypothesis. This is the first study reporting on C. microsporus in Hulless barley in China, suggesting that barley is a new host of C. microsporus.

AB Fungal endophytes are harboured in the leaves of every individual plant host and contribute to plant health, leaf senescence, and early decomposition. In grasslands, fungal endophytes and their hosts often coexist with large herbivores. However, the influence of grazing by large herbivores on foliar fungal endophyte communities remains largely unexplored. We conducted a long-term (18 yr) grazing experiment to explore the effects of grazing on the community composition and diversity of the foliar fungal endophytes of two perennial grassland species (i.e., Artemisia capillaris and Stipa bungeana) across one growing season. Grazing significantly increased the mean fungal alpha diversity of A. capillaris in the early season. In contrast, grazing significantly reduced the mean fungal alpha diversity of endophytic fungi of S. bungeana in the late season. Grazing, growing season, and their interactions concurrently structured the community composition of the foliar fungal endophytes of both plant species. However, growing season consistently outperformed grazing and environmental factors in shaping the community composition and diversity of both plant species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the foliar endophytic fungal community diversity and composition differed in response to grazing between A. capillaris and S. bungeana during one growing season. The focus on this difference will enhance our understanding of grazing's impact on ecological systems and improve land management practices in grazing regions. This variation in the effects of leaf nutrients and plant community characteristics on foliar endophytic fungal community diversity and composition may have a pronounced impact on plant health and plant-fungal interactions.

AB Many silicon-on-insulator (SOI) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are used in deep space detection systems because they have higher radiation resistance than bulk silicon devices. However, SOI devices have to face the double challenge of radiation and conventional reliability problems, such as hot carrier stress, at the same time. Thus, we wondered whether there is any interaction between reliability degradation and irradiation damage. In this paper, the effect of hot-carrier injection (HCI) on gamma-ray-irradiated partially depleted (PD) SOI n-MOSFETs with a T-shaped gate structure is investigated. A strange phenomenon that accelerated the annealing effect on irradiation devices caused by HCI in 5 s was observed. That is, HCI has fast recovery ability on the irradiated narrow-channel n-MOSFETs. We explain the physical mechanism of this recovery effect qualitatively. Moreover, we designed a comparable experiment to evaluate the effect on the wide-channel devices. These results show that the narrow-channel devices are more sensitive to irradiation and HCI effects than wide-channel devices.

AB A two-prey and one-predator system with quadratic self-interaction is discussed on subsets of special biological sense, none of which is closed under operations of the polynomial ring. The known work studied the stability of the boundary equilibria and gave invariant algebraic surfaces up to degree two but no further discussion for bifurcations. In this paper, we investigate the finite and infinite equilibria and their qualitative properties in the first octant. Moreover, we discuss their bifurcations, such as transcritical bifurcation on boundary equilibria, and give the bifurcation diagram. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results in this paper.

TI Why Do Herdsmen Not Support Deratization? A Survey on the Awareness of
   Rodent Control in the Tibetan Areas of Sichuan Province, China
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Awareness of deratization; Sichuan Tibetan area; Age; Education levels
ID MYOSPALAX-BAILEYI
AB Rodents are a critical part of the grassland ecosystem, but at a high population density, they trigger grassland desertification, unsustainable development of animal husbandry, increase in the incidence of rodent-borne diseases and the potential for zoonoses. The Sichuan Tibetan area is ecologically fragile and has reported the most serious rodent damage in China. The rodent control technology is presently advanced and diverse, however, awareness among the herdsmen in this area to control the rodents remains relatively regressive. Given the limitations in organizing herdsmen to participate in the government-organized rodent control, open-ended and closed-ended combined questionnaires were executed in the summer of 2020 for investigating the consciousness of deratization and the factors influencing the herdsmen. The age of the respondents ranged between 18 and 73, and 261 valid questionnaires were collected. The results demonstrated that the herdsmen who agreed with deratization were between 31-40 years old (71.70%), possessed a college education or above (69.92%), killed rodents when their damage was serious (70.48%), and participated at least once in deratization organized by the government (76.35%). There was a significant difference in the awareness of rodent control among the herdsmen having different education levels. The consciousness for deratization among the herdsmen was affected by age, education level, attitude towards killing rodents, and several other factors. Thus, it could be concluded that improving the levels of education, the prevention, and control mechanisms, as well as reshaping the deratization concept can encourage the herdsmen to establish a scientific and rational ecological explanation justifying the necessity of deratization. This can not only contribute to the long-term prevention of disease and damage caused by the rodents in the Sichuan Tibetan area but also benefit the local sustainable development.

TI Tuning of defect structure and electrical properties for potassium
   sodium niobate lead-free ceramics with oxides
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PIEZOELECTRICITY; MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR; STRAIN
AB Oxides addition has been realized as an effective way to promote macro performance in potassium sodium niobate (KNN) ceramics, which is crucial for practical applications. Herein, the influence of different oxides (Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 & MnO2) on defect structure and electrical properties as well as temperature stability is explored in KNN-based ceramics. A tendency of first decreasing and then increasing is observed for O vacancy when additives change from Fe2O3 to Fe2O3 & MnO2, which is due to the enhanced A-site vacancy and Fe center dot K/ Na from main occupancy of Fe on K/Na site for Fe2O3 addition and increased defect dipoles between Mn2+/ Mn3+/ Mn4+ and O vacancy induced by occupancy of Mn on Nb site. The remained R-O-T phase boundary is gained with little improved diffusion behavior when oxides are added, accompanied by gradually refined grains with Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 & MnO2 in sequence. Then strengthened dielectric and piezoelectric properties are realized with the addition of Fe2O3 & MnO2, which is generated by the polarization of defect dipoles. And better improved strain and piezoelectricity temperature stability are achieved in Fe2O3- added ceramics, originating from A-site vacancy which can promote domain switching. Therefore, this work demonstrates a strategy to optimize electrical properties via adding appropriate oxides in KNN-based ceramics.

AB A strategy for the synthesis of iodo-substituted allylic pyrazoles through NIS-mediated regioselective addition of allenamides with pyrazoles is presented. This reaction proceeds rapidly, is scalable up to a gram scale, and tolerates a broad scope of substrates. Moreover, using 1,2,4-triazole as the nucleophile, the corresponding 1,2-addition product was obtained in good yield. Significantly, the products of this reaction, iodo-substituted allylic pyrazoles, could undergo coupling with phenylacetylene under Sonogashira cross-coupling conditions.

AB Antibiotics play an essential role in the treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Despite their benefits, the release of an increasing amount of various antibiotics into the environment poses a potential threat to plants, soils, animals, and microorganisms. Here, an outdoor pot experiment was conducted to preliminarily evaluate high concentrations of three antibiotics (oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin) on Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. and its rhizospheric organisms. The results showed that the three antibiotics had different effects on the growth behavior (germination uniformity, average growing height gain per week, and thousand seed weight) and biomass (aboveground biomass and belowground biomass) of Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. After adding high concentrations of the three antibiotics to the soil of each test group, the earthworm extract in group A (oxytetracycline) significantly increased the coagulation parameters prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT). The PT significantly decreased (p < 0.01), while the TT was not affected in group B (ciprofloxacin). For group C (tobramycin), the TT significantly decreased (p < 0.01) and the PT was not affected compared to the CK group (control group). The application of the three antibiotics caused alterations in the general activity of enzymes, such as soil sucrase (SC), urease (UE), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and nitrate reductase (NR). Different antibiotic groups influenced the rhizosphere bacterial diversity and community structure of Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. At the phylum level, Ignavibacteriae was only found in group C, and Parcubacteria and Ignavibacteriae were not present in the CK group. At the genus level, Parcubacteria_norank was not present in the CK group, and BSV40_norank was found in group C. Ultimately, the results suggested that high concentrations of oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin could affect the growth behavior and biomass of Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. and alter its rhizobacterial community structure, providing the scientific basis for the rational use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary science.

AB Background Erigeron multiradiatus (Lindl.) Benth. has been used for years to treat various diseases in traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM). Our previous studies have shown that E. multiradiatus extract has important pharmacological effects, such as anti-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects. To date, there have been no reports on using this extract to treat thrombosis. Objectives The aim of this study was to enrich the active components of E. multiradiatus and to further investigate its anti-thrombotic activity. Materials and Methods We used D101 macroporous adsorption resin to enrich the main active substances of E. multiradiatus and performed quantitative determination using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector (UHPLC-PDA). Furthermore, we investigated the anti-thrombotic effects of E. multiradiatus using three models: an arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation thrombotic zebrafish model, a phenylhydrazine-induced red blood cell (RBC)-injuring thrombotic zebrafish model, and a ponatinib-induced vascular endothelial cell (VEC)-injuring thrombotic zebrafish model. Results The yield of active component enrichment of E. multiradiatus was 4.95% using the D101 resin. We accurately determined eight compounds in the extract. Our results showed that these extracts had significant anti-thrombotic effects in the three different zebrafish models. Conclusion The enriched extract of E. multiradiatus could be used as a natural anti-thrombotic agent. Our results will provide a reference for reasonable clinical applications of E. multiradiatus.

AB Our paper explores whether Chinese insurance companies exhibit a local preference in deciding their equity portfolios and the incentive of this preference. Our research finds that Chinese insurance institutional investors significantly tilt to invest in local firms geographically close to them, and local investments do not significantly outperform non-local investments. The results indicate that the behavioral aspect of home bias, rather than information advantage, play a more significant role in deciding equity holdings of China's insurance companies. Additionally, local equity preference is more pronounced in dialect-segmented areas and life insurance firms. This paper incorporates hometown identification into the analysis framework of insurance companies' portfolio decision-making and enriches the research of their investing strategies from the perspective of behavioral finance.

AB Introduction: Vacuolar protein sorting 29 (VPS29) is a core component of the retromer-retriever complex and is essential for recycling numerous cell-surface cargoes from endosomes. However, there are no reports yet on VPS29 of Eimeria spp.
   Methods:Here, we cloned and prokaryotically expressed a partial sequence of Eimeria tenella VPS29 (EtVPS29) with RT-PCR and engineered strain of Escherichia coli respectively. The localization of the VPS29 protein in E. tenella sporozoites was investigated with immunofluorescence (IFA) and overexpression assays. And its protective efficacy against E. tenella infection was investigated in chickens with the animal protection test.
   ResultsAn EtVPS29 gene fragment with an ORF reading frame of 549 bp was cloned. The band size of the expressed recombinant protein, rEtVPS29, was approximately 39 kDa and was recognized by the chicken anti-E. tenella positive serum. EtVPS29 protein was observed widely distributing in the cytoplasm of E. tenella sporozoites in the IFA and overexpression assays. rEtVPS29 significantly increased average body weight gain and decreased mean lesion score and oocyst output in chickens. The relative weight gain rate in the rEtVPS29-immunized group was 62.9%, which was significantly higher than that in the unimmunized and challenged group (P < 0.05). The percentage of reduced oocyst output in the rEtVPS29 immunized group was 32.2%. The anticoccidial index of the rEtVPS29-immunized group was 144.2. Serum ELISA also showed that rEtVPS29 immunization induced high levels of specific antibodies in chickens.
   DiscussionThese results suggest that rEtVPS29 can induce a specific immune response and is a potential candidate for the development of novel vaccines against E. tenella infections in chickens.

AB There are many specific risks in renewable energy (RE) investment projects, and the incidences of these risk factors are fuzzy and uncertain. In different stages of a project's life cycle, the main risk factors frequently change. Therefore, this paper constructed a cloud dynamic Bayesian network model (Cloud-DBN) for RE operation processes; it uses the DBN graph theory to show the generation mechanism and evolution process of RE outbound investment risks, to make the risk prediction structure clear. Based on the statistical data of observation nodes, the probability of risk occurrence is deduced to ensure the scientific nature of the reasoning process. The probability of risk being low, medium, or high is given, which is highly consistent with the uncertainty and randomness of risk. An improved formula for quantitative data normalization is proposed, and an improved calculation method for joint conditional probability based on weight and contribution probability is proposed, which reduces the workload of determining numerous joint conditional probabilities and improves the practicability of the BN network with multiple parent nodes. According to the 20-year historical statistical data of observation nodes, the GM(1,1) algorithm was used to extract the transfer characteristics of observation nodes, construct the DBN network, and deduce the annual risk probability of each risk node during the operation period of the RE project. The method was applied to the wind power project invested by China in Pakistan, and the effectiveness of the method was tested. The method in this paper provides a basis for investment decisions in the RE project planning period and provides targeted risk reduction measures for the project's operation period.

AB Let a, b E Rn be column vectors, and (u, v) be the inner product of vectors u and v on Rn . Let G c GL(n, R) be a compact matrix group. For A E G and a continue function f on G, the integral fG f(A)dA is the invariant integral of the compact group G. In this paper, we study the inequality   Vx E Rn G e(Aa,x)dA G e(Ab, x)dA. We prove that the above inequality holds if and only if b E Conv(Ga). This work follows a series of results, that is, Muirhead (1903), Hardy, Littlewood and Po`lya (1932), Rado (1952), Daykin (1971), Kimelfeld (1995) and Schulman (2009). Furthermore, We construct an determining algorithm when G is finite. Compared with other effective algorithms, this one is symbolic and easy to implement on computer.

ID OPINION DYNAMICS; KINETIC-MODELS; BOLTZMANN; UNAWARE
AB We employ the theory of rarefied gas dynamics and optimal control to investigate the kinetic model of decision-making. The novelty of this paper is that we develop a kinetic model that takes into account both the influence of agents' competence and managers' control on decision-making. After each interaction, in addition to the changes in decision directly caused by communication with other agents, the agents' competence evolves and indirectly influences the degree of decision adjustment through the compromise function. By adding a control term to the model, the behavior of the managers who require the group to establish consensus is also described, and the concrete expression of the control term that minimizes the cost function is obtained by model predictive control. The Boltzmann equation is constructed to characterize the evolution of the density distribution of agents, and the main properties are discussed. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is derived by utilizing the asymptotic technique. Lastly, the direct simulation of the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the evolution of decisions. The results indicate that the agents' competence and managers' control facilitate the consistency of collective decisions.

The electronic properties were carried out to discuss the effect of doped C on the conductivity, chemical bonding components, and orbital hybridization of CrB4. What is more, we employed a semiempir-ical method to evaluate the hardness of these three crystals. Mechanical properties and large hardness of them indicate that they are hard materials. In addition, the influence of pressure on the elastic constants of the three structures is different. The c-axis direction of CrCB3 and CrC2B2 is relatively more difficult to compress.

AB ObjectiveA novel Bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAdV-3) with a natural deletion partial fiber gene was isolated in 2020 and named BO/YB24/17/CH. The objective of this study was to understand the pathogenicity of this virus. MethodsThiry-two 3-week-old BALB/c mice were divided into three experimental groups and a control group. Mice in the experimental groups were intranasally inoculated with virus, and mice in the control group were inoculated with MDBK cell supernatant. Mice were weighed and clinically examined daily for appearance of any clinical signs. Three infected mice and one control mouse were euthanized at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 days after inoculation. Tissue samples were collected for histopathological examination, immunohistochemical staining, and detection of the replication dynamics of virus. ResultsAll infected mice developed mild clinical signs such as lethargy, weight loss, loss of appetite, and a rough hair coat, and gross lesions were observed as pulmonary punctate hemorrhage, lobular atrophy and splenomegaly. Histopathological examination revealed thickening of alveolar septa and mildly dilated splenic nodules and blurred red-white medullary demarcation in the spleen. Immunohistochemical results further confirmed that the production of the above lesions was due to viral infection. Importantly, unlike previously reported BAdV-3 detection only in the lungs and trachea, this isolate could be detected in multiple organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and even blood by virus isolation and titration and real-time PCR methods. Clinical significanceThis study provides further insight into the pathogenicity of the fiber region deletion strain BO/YB24/17/CH in BALB/c mice, which provides a reference for the prevention and control of BAdV-3 as well as the development of vaccines.

In our investigation, wild Pterorhinus sannio were presented with a self-recognition test known as the mirror self-recognition test (MSR). All birds performed four different displays in front of the mirror that we call "look around", "crouch", "jump to top of the mirror", and "shake the wings". These behaviours did not occur in the absence of the mirror. These behaviours typically are directed towards other individuals this suggest that P. sannio does not recognise itself in the mirror, and it does not have the capacity of self-awareness, at least not judged from the mark mirror test.

ID RESTORATION; RECOVERY
AB Utilizing low-rank prior data in compressed sensing (CS) schemes for Landsat 8-9 remote sensing images (RSIs) has recently received widespread attention. Nevertheless, most CS algorithms focus on the sparsity of an RSI and ignore its low-rank (LR) nature. Therefore, this paper proposes a new CS reconstruction algorithm for Landsat 8-9 remote sensing images based on a non-local optimization framework (NLOF) that is combined with non-convex Laplace functions (NCLF) used for the low-rank approximation (LAA). Since the developed algorithm is based on an approximate low-rank model of the Laplace function, it can adaptively assign different weights to different singular values. Moreover, exploiting the structural sparsity (SS) and low-rank (LR) between the image patches enables the restored image to obtain better CS reconstruction results of Landsat 8-9 RSI than the existing models. For the proposed scheme, first, a CS reconstruction model is proposed using the non-local low-rank regularization (NLLRR) and variational framework. Then, the image patch grouping and Laplace function are used as regularization/penalty terms to constrain the CS reconstruction model. Finally, to effectively solve the rank minimization problem, the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) is used to solve the model. Extensive numerical experimental results demonstrate that the non-local variational framework (NLVF) combined with the low-rank approximate regularization (LRAR) method of non-convex Laplace function (NCLF) can obtain better reconstruction results than the more advanced image CS reconstruction algorithms. At the same time, the model preserves the details of Landsat 8-9 RSIs and the boundaries of the transition areas.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) are an essential mediator hormone that can regulate animal growth, behavior, the phenotype of offspring, and so on, while GCs in poultry are predominantly corticosterones. The biological activity of GCs is mainly regulated by the intracellular metabolic enzymes, including 11 beta-hydroxysteroid de-hydrogenases 1 (11 beta-HSD1), 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 2 (11 beta-HSD2), and 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20-HSD). To investigate the embryonic mechanisms of phenotypic differences between breeds, we compared the expression of corticosterone metabolic enzyme genes in the yolk-sac membrane and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). We described the tissue distribution and ontogenic patterns of corticosterone metabolic enzymes during embryonic incubation between Tibetan and broiler chickens. Forty fertilized eggs from Tibetan and broiler chickens were incubated under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively. Realtime fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of 11 beta-HSD1/2, and 20-HSD mRNA in embryonic tissues. The results showed that the expression levels of yolk-sac membrane mRNA of 11 beta-HSD2 and 20-HSD in Tibetan chickens on E14 (embryonic day of 14) were significantly lower than those of broiler chickens (P < 0.05), and these genes expression of CAM in Tibetan chickens were higher than those of broiler chickens (P < 0.05). In addition, the three genes in the yolk-sac membrane and CAM were followed by a down-regulation on E18 (embryonic day of 18). The 11 beta-HSD1 and 11 beta-HSD2 genes followed a similar tissue-specific pattern: the expression level was more abundantly in the liver, kidney, and intestine, with relatively lower abundance in the hypothalamus and muscle, and the expression level of 20-HSD genes in all tissues tested was higher. In the liver, 20-HSD of both Tibetan and broiler chickens showed different ontogeny development patterns, and hepatic mRNA expression of 20-HSD in broiler chickens was significantly higher than that of Tibetan chickens of the same age from E14 to E18 (P < 0.05). This study preliminarily revealed the expression levels of cortisol metabolic genes in different tissues during the development process of Tibetan and broiler chicken embryos. It provided essential information for in-depth research of the internal mechanism of maternal GCs programming on offspring.

AB The insights gained from individual tracking can improve the conservation of released young green sea turtles by providing detailed data on migration route, feeding place and habitat distribution. During the fishing moratorium from May 1 to August 16 in 2021, we used satellites to track 6 juvenile green sea turtles released from China's Huidong Sea Turtle Nature Reserve, and located and reconstructed their migration routes and foraging sea areas. The tracking data shows that the longest tracking time is 91 days, the shortest time is 10 days, and the total tracking time is 213 days, of which three (50%) obtained tracking data for more than one month, and the total movement distances (statistics LC3-LCB) ranges from 124 to 4627 km, while the accurate movement distances (counted by dot pitch above LC0) ranged from 39.5-2331 km. The average daily movement distances ranges from 3.95 to 51.4 km, and the average speed varies between 0.16 to 2.14 km/h. The green turtles released from the China Turtle Bay migrate along the northern coastline of the South China Sea or go straight to the South China Sea. After a month or so, they migrate from Huidong Turtle Bay to Hainan Lingao, Beibu Gulf and Xisha Islands. The northern coast of the South China Sea is one of the migration routes of green sea turtles. Beibu Bay, Zhanjiang Port, Daya Bay, Red Bay, Nan'ao Island, Zhelin Bay and Xisha Islands are important foraging places for green sea turtles. The protection of migration routes and important foraging grounds is one of the key measures to protect sea turtles.

AB Hyperspectral-image (HSI) restoration plays an essential role in remote sensing image processing. Recently, superpixel segmentation-based the low-rank regularized methods for HSI restoration have shown outstanding performance. However, most of them simply segment the HSI according to its first principal component, which is suboptimal. In this paper, integrating the superpixel segmentation with principal component analysis, we propose a robust superpixel segmentation strategy to better divide the HSI, which can further enhance the low-rank attribute of the HSI. To better employ the low-rank attribute, the weighted nuclear norm by three types of weighting is proposed to efficiently remove the mixed noise in degraded HSI. Experiments conducted on simulated and real HSI data verify the performance of the proposed method for HSI restoration.

AB In this contribution, N-doped carbon nanotubes were obtained through nitrogen plasma treatment and used as the anchoring sites for Ru catalysts in one-pot cellobiose conversion to hexitols. XPS and HR TEM-EDS analysis revealed a successful introduction of N on CNTs using 300 min nitrogen plasma treatment. Both the activation ability and the amount of activated H-2 were improved by the N-anchored Ru active phase, leading to a much-enhanced hexitols yield. The hexitols yield reached 91.5% on Ru/CNT-P-t300 catalyst, being substantially higher than those on Ru/AC (56.84%) and Ru/CNT (76.84%). DFT simulation results verified the enhanced H-2 activation ability. The Eb value of the Ru4 cluster binds with (5, 5) CNT and (5, 5) N-CNT was -4.11 and -4.66 eV, respectively, suggesting that the graphitic-N engaged as the anchoring sites for Ru via strong interaction. The research highlights a green and facile strategy to dope N element as the anchoring sites for noble metal catalyst in improving H-2 activation capability for a broad hydrogenation application.

However, the living environments of Mylabris is differ, so Mylabris may be contaminated by heavy metal pollution depending on the environment. These environments may also affect the amount of biosynthesis of its medicinal ingredient, cantharidin, there by affecting the quality of Mylabris. In this study, we determined the heavy metal content in Mylabris from different origins by using ICP-MS, evaluated the risk posed by these heavy metals, and recommended theoretical maximum limits of heavy metals in medicinal Mylabris. The results show that the Cu content in Mylabris is substantially higher than that in Cr, As, Pb, Cd, and Hg. A quantitative risk assessment showed that Mylabris poses no noncarcinogenic risks. The results of the total carcinogenic risk value showed that origins S12 and S13 pose carcinogenic risk by Cr and As, and the rest of the origins were in the human-tolerable carcinogenic risk range. We found large differences in the cantharidin content in Mylabris from different origins. In general, the Mylabris from origins S2, S3 and S4 had a higher in vivo cantharidin content, which proved that the quality of the medicinal materials was higher here than in other production areas. Finally, we providing a reference for the quality evaluation of medicinal Mylabris materials.

AB In this paper, the bifurcation theory of dynamical system is applied to investigate the time-space fractional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with Kerr law nonlinearity. We mainly consider the case of alpha not equal 2 beta which is not discussed in previous work. By overcom-ing some difficulties aroused by the singular traveling wave system, such as bifurcation analysis of nonanalytic vector field, tracking orbits near the full degenerate equilibrium and calculation of complicated elliptic integrals, we give a total of 20 explicit exact trav-eling wave solutions of the time-space fractional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and classify them into 11 categories. Some new traveling wave solutions of this equation are obtained including the compactons and the bounded solutions corresponding to some bounded manifolds.

AB In this paper, we deal with a Tykhonov well-posedness concept in the study of two nonlinear problems in reflexive Banach spaces: a general variational-hemivariational inequality problem ( VHVI) and a minimization problem (MP), constructed by using a gap function associated to VHVI. We prove the well-posedness of these problems with respect to specific Tykhonov triples, including a number of equivalence results which establish the link between the well-posedness and the unique solvability of each problem. We then show that, with a particular choice of the Tykhonov triples, it is possible to recover two well-posedness results obtained in the literature, for various classes of variational and hemivariational inequalities. Moreover, we use our results in the sensitivity analysis of VHVI, for which we prove the continuous dependence of the solution with respect to its data.

AB Introduction: The modern pentathlon requires athletes to participate in 5 individual sports (fencing, swimming, equestrian, running, and shooting combined) in one day. All of these belong to different categories, resulting in high demand for physical and mental control by the athlete. The importance of psychological factors in everyday physical activity has increased attention. Objective: This paper explores the role of comprehensive psychological training in modern pentathlon. Methods: Forty-seven modern pentathletes were selected by random sampling method. A questionnaire survey method was used to analyze the volunteers. Interviews on the psychological status of the athletes before the competition were also conducted. Finally, a statistical method was used to determine the participants' interview and questionnaire results. Results: The athletes in all five sports experienced high stress before the competitions. The second highest stress was during preparation, before the games. The incidence of anxiety, indifference, and disproportionate confidence before the competition was lower. Conclusion: The psychological state of modern pentathletes before competition is directly related to their competitive state and level.

AB Introduction: Cycling is a competitive sport and has high demands on the athletes themselves, such as versatile use of skills, physical fitness, and explosiveness. Objective: Increase the specific speed endurance of athletes. Methods: Fourteen prominent male short-distance cyclists were divided into a group of constant cyclists (CG group, n=7) and a group of decreasing cyclists (DG group, n=7) and subjected to a physical trai-ning protocol. Results: Peak activity and average endurance improved in both groups of athletes; rest periods improved significantly compared to the previous ones, and deceleration decreased by 12.2% and 14.6% in the CG and DG groups, respectively, immediately after the end of the rest period. Latency decreased significantly in both groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: Compared with the program with the same number of rides, the training load in the stage-based pilot program with the decreasing number of rides was higher, and the training effect was more significant in the improvement of peak power, 1 km total power maintenance capacity, and anae-robic threshold. The energy supply ratio of aerobic metabolism during exercise at the above intensity was also improved. Level of evidence II; Therapeutic studies -investigation of treatment outcomes.

AB The domestic yak was regarded as a valuable model to explore the molecular mechanism of high-altitude animal adaptation, including the extreme tolerance of starvation and cold stress, which is closely associated with specifically seasonal deposition and metabolism of subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, the key regulators for these processes remain largely unknown. Here, the yak adipogenesis model in vitro was established and liver kinase b1 (LKB1) was regarded as a key negative regulator involved in yak adipocytes lipid accumulation. First, the mRNA level of LKB1 in adipose tissue of yaks from the cold season is significantly higher than that of yaks from the warm season. Interestingly, overexpression of LKB1 significantly inhibited adipocytes lipid accumulation. Consistently, LKB1 overexpression dramatically suppressed mRNA levels of adipogenic transcriptional factors, including C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta and PPAR gamma, and subsequently significantly decreased levels of lipid accumulation related genes (FABP4 and FAS) compared with those of control. In contrast, overexpression of LKB1 promoted thermogenic and lipolysis related genes in yak adipocyte, including PGC1 alpha, PPAR alpha, UCP1, ATGL, HSL and LPL. Therefore, these results would provide new insights to decipher the network for domestic yak adipose deposition, and LKB1 might be as a new molecular target for animal environmental-resistant breeding.

AB Environmental protection is still a key issue that cannot be ignored at this stage of social development. With the development of artificial intelligence, various technologies increasingly tend to be widely used in the field of environmental protection, such as searching the wilderness through an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and cleaning garbage by robots. Traditional object detection algorithms for this scenario suffer from low accuracy and high computational cost. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm applied to automatic garbage detection and instance segmentation in complex scenes. First, we construct sample-fused feature pyramid networks (SF-FPN) to achieve multi-scale feature sampling on multiple levels, to enhance the semantic representation of features. Second, adding the mask branch based on conditional convolution, introducing the idea of instance-filters to automatically generate the filter parameters of the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), to realize the instance-level pixel classification. Moreover, the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module is introduced to encode the feature information in a dense way to assist the generation of MASK. Finally, the object is detected and the instance is segmented by a two-branch structure. In addition, we also perform data augmentation on the original dataset to prevent model overfitting. The proposed algorithm reaches 82.7 and 72.4 according to the mAP index of detection and instance segmentation while using the public TACO dataset.

AB Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic protein implicated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory and proliferative disorders. The gene sequence of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) was identified and the expression level of it was regulated by cadmium exposure in our previous study. To further clarify the immune-regulatory activity of grass carp MIF, MIF was over-expressed and interfered in grass carp peripheral blood leukocytes via transfection of plasmids pcDNA3.1-MIF-EGFP and pLKO.1-shRNA-EGFP-puro, respectively. Subsequently, survival, phagocytic capacity, mitochondrial function and cytokine production of the transfected leukocytes were assayed. The results shown that grass carp MIF was necessary for leukocyte survival, because it enhanced leukocyte viability and inhibited cell apoptosis, while MIF interference disrupted the cell viability and induced leukocyte apoptosis. The effect might benefit from improved mitochondrial function as evidenced by increased ATP production, which was due to maintained mitochondrial trans-membrane potential. In addition, MIF is essential for neutral red uptake into leukocyte, and it provoked chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8), and suppressed anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL10) production. These results indicated that grass carp MIF played a vital role in regulating inflammatory properties and survival of peripheral blood leukocytes.

AB The novel coronavirus disease - COVID-19 is a historic catastrophe that has caused many devastating impacts on human life and wellness. Researchers in academia and industry strive to understand the causes of this pandemic disease and find new therapeutics combating it. Consequently, the number of COVID-19 related publications increases rapidly, and it is too difficult for medical researchers and practitioners to keep up with the latest research and development. Literature filtering and categorization, and knowledge discovery can use text mining as a powerful tool. In this paper, we propose a text mining method to explore the categories of COVID-19 related themes and identify the standard methodologies that have been used. We discuss the potential limitations of this preliminary study and present future perspectives related to COVID-19 research.

AB Alveolar echinococcosis is an important cestode diseases with a huge public health impact, it caused by larval of Echinococus multilocularis, whose life cycle requires a variety of canids and small mammals as hosts. The terminal hosts have received a lot of attention, while there are few studies on the distribution and abundance of intermediate hosts. A structural equation model was produced to demonstrate the effects of habitat factors on the distribution and abundance of intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) act as the main intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis, whose effective cave density was 0.03/m2 to 0.32/m2, and it was negatively correlated with altitude at a high value (p = 0.010). Altitude regulates the distribution and abundance of plateau pika by influencing food resources and their fertility, which in turn affects the transmission of alveolar echinococcosis.

TI Comparative Analysis of Volleyball Serve Action Based on Human Posture

SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID LEVEL; PERFORMANCE
AB Serving is one of the most crucial techniques in volleyball. Serving is a method that does not require team interaction and is difficult for the opponent to immediately interfere with. The feature migration module with a fixed offset is suggested in this work. This module can be thought of as a cross-channel dilated convolution approximation of dilated convolution. The reason cross-channel dilated convolution is not worse than standard dilated convolution with few parameters is discussed in this article. An improved random forest model is put forth to address the issue of the human pose estimation system's high memory consumption when utilizing random forest as the classifier. This model presents the Poisson process and incorporates it with the depth data to create a filter before using Bootstrap sampling. In order to optimize and reconstruct the training dataset, a portion of the feature sample points that do not contribute positively to subsequent classification is removed from the original training dataset. This allows the training dataset to better account for the repeated sampling of the random forest during the sampling process. Resampling has some drawbacks, but they are not very representative. The effectiveness of the optimization model, which significantly lowers the system's time and space complexity and increases the system's applicability, is demonstrated by experiments.

ID VISUAL SENSE; NUMEROSITY; MECHANISMS; SIZE; PERCEPTION
AB A series of studies show interest in how visual attributes affect the estimate of object numbers in a scene. In comparison tasks, it is suggested that larger patches are perceived as more numerous. However, the inequality of density, which changes inversely with the area when numerosity remains constant, may mediate the influence of area on numerosity perception. This study aims to explore the role of area and density in the judgment of numerosity. The Ebbinghaus illusion paradigm was adopted to induce differences in the perceived, rather than the physical, area of the two patches to be compared. Participants were asked to compare the area, density, and the number of the two patches in three tasks. To this end, no PSE (point of subjective equality) bias was found in number comparison with randomly distributed dots, although a significant difference was revealed in the perceived area of the two patches. No PSE bias was found in the density comparison, either. For a comparison, density and number tasks were also conducted with regularly distributed dots. No PSE bias was found in density comparison. By contrast, significant PSE bias showed up in number comparison, and larger patches appeared to be more numerous than smaller patches. The density mechanism was proposed as the basis for number comparison with regular patterns. The individual Weber fractions for regular patterns were not correlated with those for random patterns in the number task, but they were correlated with those for both patterns in the density task. To summarize, numerosity is directly sensed, and numerosity perception is not affected by area inequality induced by the Ebbinghaus illusion. In contrast, density and area are combined to infer numerosity when the approximate numerosity mechanism is disrupted by dot distribution.

AB In this study, the chloroplast genomes of Acanthocalyx alba (Hand.-Mazz., 1925) and Acanthocalyx nepalensis subsp. delavayi (Franchet, 1885) were sequenced, and their total lengths were 148,720 bp and 149,253 bp, respectively. The A. alba genome contained two inverted repeat regions (IRs) of 21,849 bp, a large single-copy region (LSC) of 89,084 bp, and a small single-copy region (SSC) of 15,938 bp, whereas A. nepalensis subsp. delavayi contained two IRs of 21,736 bp, one LSC of 89,034 bp, and one SSC of 16,747 bp. The chloroplast genomes of both A. alba and A. nepalensis subsp. delavayi contained 109 genes, including 72 mRNA, 33 tRNA, and four rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that A. alba is in a clade with A. nepalensis subsp. delavayi. This study provides useful data for further phylogenetic studies of A. alba and A. nepalensis subsp. delavayi.

AB Promoting photocatalytic performance by modulating the external irradiation field is a new concept in both photocatalytic theory and applications. Here, based on the Einstein rate equation, we have firstly demonstrated that the duration of atom activity can be prolonged by decoupling the weak excitation towards ultra-violet spectra or saturating the irradiative intensity at material central frequency. Guided by the theoretical deduction, the wavelength dispersive in-situ florescence spectroscopy and stepwise irradiative technique were then employed to give experimental evidences, where the theory derived optimal irradiation field was validated for promoting photocatalytic activity of Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)/TiO(2 )hybrid materials. By periodically projecting the optimal excitation instead of continuous visible illumination, the photocatalytic performance can be improved by 15% with nearly halved irradiance consumption (55%). It is believed that these findings might push photocatalytic efficiency into higher steps with the assistance of a deep understanding of irradiative theory and engineering.

AB In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called the partial-failure segregated multicasting routing and spectrum assignment (PFS MRSA) algorithm to improve the service blocking performance of the multicast transmission in flex-grid optical networks (FGONs). By segregating one failure destination leaf-node from a blocked multicast request and accommodating the failure destination leaf-node and the remaining multicast request independently, the success probability of accommodating the originally blocked multicast request can be greatly increased. In this way, the proposed PFS MRSA algorithm can effectively reduce the service blocking probability for the multicast services in FGONs. Simulation results show that the proposed PFS MRSA algorithm achieves significant reduction in service blocking probability when compared with the conventional MRSA algorithms, and such reduction can even reach 100% in some scenarios with low traffic load.

AB Let R be a commutative ring. An R-module M is said to be an absolutely w-pure module if Ext(R)(1)(F, M) is GV-torsion for any finitely presented R-module F. In this paper, we further study some homological properties of absolutely w-pure modules and introduce the weak FP-injective dimension. The closeness of some classes of absolutely w-pure modules is discussed. By comparing, we also give examples to show that the class of absolutely w-pure modules is not necessarily closed under the intersection of a descending chain of absolutely w-pure modules or under the submodules of absolutely w-pure modules. Finally, the weak FP-injective dimension over coherent rings is studied.

AB In recent years, the development of visual tracking is getting better and better, but some methods cannot overcome the problem of low accuracy and success rate of tracking. Although there are some trackers will be more accurate, they will cost more time. In order to solve the problem, we propose a reinforced tracker based on Hierarchical Convolutional Features (HCF for short). HOG, color-naming and grayscale features are used with different weights to supplement the convolution features, which can enhance the tracking robustness. At the same time, we improved the model update strategy to save the time costs. This tracker is called RHCF and the code is published on https://github.com/z15846/RHCF. Experiments on the OTB2013 dataset show that our tracker can validly achieve the promotion of the accuracy and success rate.

DE NMF; minimum correlation; RFID; anti-collision; underdeter-mined mixture
AB Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a promising data-driven matrix decomposition method, and is becoming very active and attractive in machine learning and blind source separation areas. So far NMF algorithm has been widely used in diverse applications, including image processing, anti-collision for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems and audio signal analysis, and so on. However the typical NMF algorithms cannot work well in underdetermined mixture, i.e., the number of observed signals is less than that of source signals. In practical applications, adding suitable constraints fused into NMF algorithm can achieve remarkable decomposition results. As a motivation, this paper proposes to add the minimum volume and minimum correlation constrains (MCV) to the NMF algorithm, which makes the new algorithm named MCV-NMF algorithm suitable for underdetermined scenarios where the source signals satisfy mutual independent assumption. Experimental simulation results validate that the MCV-NMF algorithm has a better performance improvement in solving RFID tag anti-collision problem than that of using the nearest typical NMF method.

AB A magnetic sensor array is usually used for weak magnetic target detection. This paper presents a vector second-order gradiometer that is arranged in a vertical structure. The measurement accuracy of the gradiometer is affected by the error of each three-axis magnetometer (TAM) and the misalignment error between TAMs. By analyzing the error mechanism of the magnetic gradiometer test system, the corresponding error model for the correction of the gradient of the component is established. The error parameters of the gradiometer were estimated by the proposed method, and the gradient error of the magnetic field and the component gradient error of the magnetic field were corrected. After correction, the gradiometer is used to localize the magnetic target. Simulation results illustrate that the localization error of magnetic targets is reduced by two orders. Thus, this proposed correction method can effectively improve the locating performance of gradiometer.

AB Background: Erigeron multiradiatus (EM), a well-known traditional Tibetan medicine, has been used for hundreds of years to treat various chronic metabolic diseases. However, previous studies on EM have primarily focused on its pharmacognosy, identification, and clinical efficacy, which lacks a systematic material basis research to identify therapeutic targets. Objectives: In this study, we investigated the potential quality marker (Q-marker) and the pharmacological mechanisms of EM during treatment of diabetic microangiopathy (DM) using both ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) and network pharmacology. Materials and Methods: The chemical profile of EM was qualitatively identified for the first time by using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. A network pharmacology methodology was then used to predict the major active components and key pharmacological pathways of EM in the treatment of DM. The compound-target network was constructed using Cytoscape software. Finally, virtual screening was conducted using molecular docking, and a cytopathological model was established by culturing vascular endothelial cells under in vitro conditions to verify the predicted bioactive markers. Results: A total of 26 compounds were identified and tentatively characterized in the chemical profile of EM based on the reference standards and mass spectral data. Network analysis was performed on 107 overlapping gene symbols, and seven bioactive constituents (e.g., quercetin, apigenin, luteolin, scutellarin, rutin, chlorogenic acid, and chrysoeriol) were identified as potentially bioactive markers. The results of molecular docking showed that quercetin, scutellarin, and rutin exhibited higher binding affinity to core targets than that of the remaining four compounds. The effects of quercetin, scutellarin, and rutin on vascular endothelial cells were investigated under in vitro conditions. According to the results, scutellarin and quercetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and decreased the levels of nitrous oxide, and reduced glutathione. Conclusion: This study showed that scutellarin and quercetin can be the Q-markers of EM due to their possible therapeutic efficacy in treating DM. It provided fundamental insight into chemical profiling, pharmacological mechanisms, and quality control of EM.

AB Simple Summary The hippocampus region of birds is a pivotal area for learning and memory. Early-life conditions can have a long-lasting impact on animals. However, the influence of early-life and later-life environments on animals' health and welfare has not been well-studied. This study addresses the impact of early-life enrichment and the later environment on the learning ability and hippocampal responses in chicks. We found that the early-life environmental complexity did not prepare better for learning ability in response to life challenges in the future. This study indicates that perches and litter materials, which enriched early-life conditions, were conducive to improved stress responses later in life in terms of neural- and immune-related gene expression and functional pathways. This can be attributed to the "silver spoon" effect. However, the enrichment through litter materials alone in early life does not improve the hippocampal plasticity in later stressed environments. In addition, early-life barren conditions that match later-life conditions have beneficial impacts on neural development, supporting the match and mismatch theory. This study helps us to understand the relationship between early- and later-life environments from the perspective of animal neural- and immune-related development. It also has the potential to guide the treatment of mental problems and personal health in humans based on the interactions between the early-life and later-life environments. In this study, we hypothesized that complex early-life environments enhance the learning ability and the hippocampal plasticity when the individual is faced with future life challenges. Chicks were divided into a barren environment group (BG), a litter materials group (LG), and a perches and litter materials group (PLG) until 31 days of age, and then their learning abilities were tested following further rearing in barren environments for 22 days. In response to the future life challenge, the learning ability showed no differences among the three groups. In the hippocampal KEGG pathways, the LG chicks showed the downregulation of neural-related genes neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and neurexins (NRXN1) in the cell adhesion molecules pathway compared to the BG (p < 0.05). Immune-related genes TLR2 in Malaria and Legionellosis and IL-18 and IL18R1 in the TNF signaling pathway were upregulated in the LG compared to in the BG (p < 0.05). Compared to the BG, the PLG displayed upregulated TLR2A in Malaria (p < 0.05). The PLG showed upregulated neural-related gene, i.e., neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7-like (CHRNA8) in the nicotine addiction pathway and secretagogin (SCGN) gene expression, as compared to the LG (p < 0.05). In conclusion, early-life environmental complexities had limited effects on the learning ability in response to a future life challenge. Early-life perches and litter materials can improve neural- and immune-related gene expression and functional pathways in the hippocampus of chicks.

AB Microwave (MW) hyperthermia has been widely studied in tumor therapy, while the lack of specificity, and the potential toxicity induced by instability or difficulty in degradation of existed MW thermal sensitizers still limits the application. Herein, a new biocompatible Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanosensitizer of Dtxl-Gd@PLGA-PEG-TPP (DGPPT) with capacities of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and mitochondrial targeting for MW hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy was constructed via a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The modified TPP significantly enhanced the specificity of sensitizer for targeting mitochondria, a heat-sensitive energy supply plant in cells. Thus the MW thermal damage induced by the loaded Gd in PLGA nanospheres was also strengthened. Together, the system could also achieve MR imaging due to the existence of Gd. In addition, the encapsulated Dtxl performed the chemotherapy of inhibiting mitochondrial function for assisting with MW hyperthermia. In vivo experiments demonstrated that PLGA had high biocompatibility that no obvious damage occurred even the dose was up to 200 mg/kg. Meanwhile, DGPPT+MW representing the combination of mitochondrial targeting and MW hyperthermia-chemotherapy has also been proved to shrink tumor size effectively. This study provides a new direction for building biosafe and multifunctional MW sensitizer with active targeting ability to impede tumor growth.

AB The objectives of the study were to investigate changes in the mRNA expression levels of five genes during antral follicle development and to assess the efficacy of four timed-artificial insemination (TAI) protocols in female yaks (Bos grunniens). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that expression levels were greater for follicle-stimulating hormone receptor and bone morphogenic protein 15 in the small follicle, luteinizing hormone receptor, and kit ligand in the large follicle, and growth differentiation factor 9 in the medium follicle (p < 0.05). Non-suckling yaks were treated as a 7-d CIDR, and PGF(2 alpha) + eCG at CIDR withdrawal and TAI with frozen yak semen at 56-58 h after PGF(2 alpha) (PPe-7d); either a 7-d CIDR (PPG-7d) or a 5-d CIDR (PPG-5d), and PGF(2 alpha) at CIDR withdrawal and TAI + GnRH at 70-72 h after PGF(2 alpha); and GnRH treatment on Day 0, followed by PGF(2 alpha) on Day 7 and TAI + GnRH on Day 9 (GPG-7d). The results showed that the pregnancy rate (P/AI) was greater in PPG-5d than in GPG-7d (p < 0.05), but the P/AI was not different among the other TAI protocols. In conclusion, the expression levels of these genes in follicles are dynamically changed during antral follicle development in yaks. The PPG-5d protocol achieved a greater P/AI.

AB The multiscale quantum harmonic-oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) is an intelligent optimisation algorithm based on quantum harmonic wave functions. Although it is effective for many optimisation problems, an analysis for its performance is still lacking. This paper discusses the harmonic-oscillator potential well, delta-function potential well, and infinite-square potential well in terms of their application in evolutionary algorithms. Of the three, the harmonic-oscillator potential well is considered to give the most precise approximation for complex objective functions. To verify its global optimisation performance, experiments are conducted using a suite of benchmark functions to compare the performance of different potential wells and heuristic algorithms. The experimental results indicate that MQHOA with the harmonic-oscillator potential well is a better practical choice than the other two potential well models, and show that MQHOA is a potential quantum heuristic algorithm.

AB The purpose of this article is to examine the socio-psychological story of vaccination prophylaxis as the means of preventing the spread of dangerous diseases, preserving public health, and analyzing elements of social response to it. The attitudes of society to vaccination measures are evident at various stages of the evolution of the health-care in various countries. The reasons for the formation of anti-vaccination movements and groups are examined: social, psychological, and cultural ones. The main anxieties and misconceptions of vaccination skeptics about the risks of vaccine prophylaxis are identified. Psychological and social determinants of the perception of vaccination as a threat to safety, as well as belief in myths and scientifically unfounded views, were found to be significant. Compulsory vaccination programs are discussed in terms of their legitimacy and effectiveness. To improve public understanding of the immunization and vaccine benefits, some methods are suggested as part of an integral policy and communication strategy. High-quality research data and a careful analysis of the socio-demographic and cultural features of vaccine skepticism should serve as the foundation to implement eventual initiatives.

AB Economic development has always been the top priority for the development of human society. However, the traditional economic development methods have led to a sharp reduction in the stock of resources and triggered a series of ecological and environmental problems, which affects social development and the progress of human civilization. Ganzi Prefecture in Sichuan is one of the main economic development entities in Sichuan Province, and its economy has developed rapidly. However, in the long run, the rapid development of the economy is accompanied by the continuous deterioration of the resources and environment, and the ecological environment will affect the social development. In this study, we use the environmental Kuznets curve to make an empirical analysis of the relationship between economic growth and environmental pollution in Ganzi Prefecture, Sichuan. The results show that the EKC curve of industrial wastewater discharge volume presents a classic inverted "U" shape. The inflection point of the curve appeared in 2007. The EKC curve of industrial waste gas emissions and industrial solid waste generation has a positive linear correlation. Industrial pollutant discharge is an important factor that affects the coordinated development of ecological environment and economic coupling. It is of reference significance to promote the realization of a resource -saving and environment friendly society in Ganzi Prefecture, Sichuan.

AB In order to reduce energy waste and improve the dynamic load balancing of heterogeneous clusters, sensor technology is introduced into the Internet of Things technology to build a channel transmission model for heterogeneous clusters. Then use the dynamic weighting method to configure the output channel to complete the decomposition of the channel characteristics. In addition, based on the establishment of the channel fuzzy recombination structure model, the noise interference suppression method is used to suppress the multipath interference of heterogeneous cluster communication channels, and the equalization of the channel output is controlled by the baud interval equalization sampling method. At the same time, through the fuzzy balance configuration and spatial balance scheduling process, the dynamic load balancing processing of heterogeneous clusters is realized. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper has better balance for the load scheduling of heterogeneous clusters and reduces the bit error rate of the output signal. More importantly, the output balance and adaptive control capabilities of heterogeneous clusters have also been improved. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lignocellulose, the most abundant biomass resource, was a promising alternative to oil resources. The acid catalyst can hydrolyze lignocellulose to reduce sugars, the raw material for lipid production via fermentation. However, the by-product yield during hydrolysis would inhibit yeast activity when directly applying lignocellulose hydrolysate from dilute acid-catalyzed to microbial lipid production. In this paper, a solid acid catalyst highly selective for lignocellulose (rice straw) hydrolysis was prepared to minimize the effects of by-products. Also, a combination of solid acid catalysts to generate glucose with subsequent microbial fermentation was studied to obtain the higher efficiency of lipid production.
   A carbon-based solid acid catalyst with an enhanced hydrolysis capacity of cellulose and lignocellulose was efficiently prepared. It resulted in 71% yield of glucose with 97% of selectivity with optimal catalyst in hydrolyzing milled cellulose. The optimal preparation conditions of the catalyst were: carbonization temperature 642 K, sulfonation temperature 412 K, initial sulfonation time 12.5 h, and liquid-to-solid ratio 11.5. To expand the catalyst' application, the rice straw hydrolysate catalyzed by the prepared catalyst was then applied to the microbial lipid production for the first time. Both dilute sulfuric acid and Amberlyst-15 resin as hydrolysis catalysts caused a decrease in yeast biomass, lipid content, and lipid yield. However, when the hydrolysate was obtained from co-heating rice straw with sucralose-derived solid acid catalyst, the yeast biomass, lipid content, and lipid yield in the presence of 5-HMF (0.39 g/L) were 12.6 g/L, 48.1%, and 7.6 g/L, respectively, and were almost similar to the control group. Our results showed that a combination of solid acid catalysts with subsequent microbial fermentation to generate lipid was confirmed to be environmentally friendly and low cost.

TI Solid State NMR Analysis for Hide Powder Tanned by Aluminum, Silicon and

ID MECHANISM
AB In order to investigate the change of chemical bonds between tanning agents and collagen molecules directly, hide powder tanned by aluminum, silicon and phosphorus tanning agents were prepared. The chemical shifts of Al, Si and P in tanned hide powder were analyzed by solid-state Al-27 NMR, Si-29 NMR and P-31 NMR. The results showed that, the chemical shift of Al in aluminum tanned hide powder which interacted with collagen molecules through coordination bond could be regarded as unchanging after hydrothermal denaturation (only slightly moved to high field area). The chemical shift of Si in silicon tanned hide powder which interacted with collagen molecules through hydrogen bond did not change after hydrothermal denaturation. The chemical shift of P in phosphorus tanned hide powder, which interacted with collagen molecules through covalent bond, was obviously shifted to the high field area after hydrothermal denaturation.

DE mental disorder; evidence-based medicine; meta-analysis; event-related
   potential; quantitative EEG; biomarker
AB Identifying the objective biological markers is one of the most important scientific goals in psychiatric research. Recently, neuroelectrophysiological studies incorporating evidence-based medicine has provided an important approach and achieved abundant results to achieve this goal. However, there are still many controversies among current evidences, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. This article comprehensively summarized the results of psychiatric studies on mental disorders which combined the method of evidence-based medicine represented by meta-analysis and the neuroelectrophysiological technique represented by electroencephalography (EEG). To systematically analyze and summarize the neurocognitive dysfunction of mental disorders and high-risk groups, event-related potential (ERP) components are divided into early and late components including different cognitive activities such as perception processing, cognitive control, emotional response, and social cognition. Evidence based on quantitative EEG analysis are also discussed. We found that schizophrenia has defects in most of cognitive processes including perception, emotion and sociality, which indexed by amplitude reduction in most of the early and late components including P50, MMN, P300 and LPP. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has defects in cognitive control indexed by amplitude reduction in the early and late components including the ERN and Pe. Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder have defects in early cognitive control, while autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has defects in early perceptual processing and social cognition indexed by amplitude reduction of N170 and FN. In addition, abnormal P300 reflexing the impaired cognitive processing speed and attention resource allocation were found across multiple diagnosis types, which indicate that this ERP component may reflect the general cognitive deficits of mental disorders. The neuroelectrophysiological studies on evidence-based medicine for mental disorders has discovered a series of valuable ERPs or EEG objective marker features, but these features still cannot be directly used in the diagnosis of personalized medicine, until these features have been identified as objective biomarkers with high accuracy and specificity in further research and clinical practice. Future research can use multi-center database to seek the electrophysiological objective markers for mental disorders, and the integrated research combining advanced technologies including multi-modal psychoradiology and artificial intelligence methods including machine learning can further enhance the reliability and validity of biological markers of mental disorders.

High-accuracy calculations have been performed as benchmarks in the request for accurate treatments of relativity, electron correlation, and quantum electrodynamic effects in multi-valence-electron systems. The calculated energy levels are in excellent agreement with the experimental results and the theoretical ones, wherever available. The calculated values including core-valence correction are found to be in good agreement with other theoretical and experimental values. The present results are reported as benchmarks for future calculations and measurements.

DE Lithium metal anode; graphene aerogel; different lateral dimensions;
   cycling stability
AB Lithium metal, regarded as one of the most potential anodes for future battery systems, has attracted much attention for a long time. Nonetheless, uncontrollable Li dendrites growth and almost infinite volume change hinder the reliable implementation of lithium anode. Three-Dimensional graphene aerogel is an ideal lithium metal host material because of its abundant porous structure and large surface area, which can relieve the volume change, as well as reduce the effective current density. The lateral dimension of raw material natural graphite will affect the morphology and hierarchical structures of graphene aerogels, thereby affecting the electrochemical properties as a lithium host material. A series of graphene aerogels were prepared from natural graphite with different lateral dimensions (3.4 mu m, 11 mu m, 44 mu m, 178 mu m) for Li host material. The GA-11/Li composite anode exhibits the best electrochemical performance. The symmetrical cell with GA-11/Li electrode shows stable cycling for 600 h at 2 mA cm(-2) for 2 mAh cm(-2). Surprisingly, the Li-S full cell with GA-11/Li anode delivers a high initial specific discharge capacity of 9.38 mAh cm(-2) and stable cycle stability.

ID IQ TEST
AB A smart city plays an increasing role in citizens' daily life. A smart city has six main components, namely smart mobility, smart economy, smart governance, smart living, smart environment, and smart people. For the past several decades, government and organizations throughout the world have initiated many smart city projects. Citizens' transportation, education, investment, and other activities have been shifted from traditional to smart models through emerging technologies and the internet. In this paper, following the pioneering work of the intelligent quotient (IQ) test, we propose a framework to measure a city's intelligence level. We also propose a definition for the intelligence of an information system. To evaluate such intelligence, 382 technology indicators have been developed. We have applied smart city IQ testing on the top 100 largest cities in the United States (according to 2017 population). In addition, the smart city IQ score is designed so that it is convertible to the age of a human being. Various text mining and data mining methods (including classification) have been applied. The results of our analysis indicate that the average smart city IQ score is like that of an eight-year-old child. We also show the breakdown of IQ scores in terms of the six main components. Although the evaluation of the smart city projects in the United States is still ongoing, the results obtained so far as reported in this paper can provide important insights for research in this particular field, as well as intelligent information systems in general.

AB The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of estrous manipulation protocols and pregnancy specific protein B (PSPB) levels to determine kid number at birth in Lezhi black goats. Eighty-eight does were randomly allocated to three treatments. The PPe group (n = 29) was treated with Controlled Internal Drug Release devices (CIDR) for 7 days and 300 IU eCG and 0.2 mg PGF(2 alpha) at the time of CIDR removal. The PPG group (n = 28) was treated with a CIDR for 7 days and 0.2 mg PGF(2 alpha) at the time of CIDR removal and 15 mu g GnRH at the onset of estrus. The GPG group (n = 31) was treated with 15 mu g GnRH (day 0) and 0.2 mg PGF(2 alpha) on day 7, and a second GnRH treatment at the onset of estrus. Does at estrus were hand-mated using proven bucks. Estrous response ranged from 80.6%-89.7 %. The onset of estrus for the PPe, PPG and GPG groups was 38.4 +/- 1.9, 45.6 +/- 1.9 and 53.8 +/- 1.4 h (P < 0.05), respectively. Mean kidding rates (205.9 %-227.8 %) and kidding percentages (112.9 %-146.4 %) were not different in the three treatments. At day 85 of gestation, does carrying quadruplets had a greater (P < 0.01) plasma PSPB level than does that delivered one to three kids. In conclusion, PPG may be a useful estrous synchronization protocol in goats. PSPB concentration at day 85 of gestation could be a potential diagnostic tool for predicting quadruplets.

TI EFFECTS OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION ON HEALTH INDICATORS OF

DT Article
DE Atmospheric environmental pollution; outdoor environment; basketball

ID PARTICLES; EXERCISE; EXPOSURE
AB Air pollutants are one of the risk factors that seriously threaten the health of basketball players in outdoor environments, and exercising under high concentrations of particulate matter pollution can lead to inflammation, decreased function of respiratory and cardiovascular tissues, and affect exercise function. To study the specific effects of atmospheric environmental pollution on the health indexes of basketball players in an outdoor environment, this paper constructs a constraint system of physical health indexes of outdoor sports population by using the parameters of maximum oxygen uptake, maximum ventilation, oxygen pulse rate and heart rate as constraint indexes, and uses the load test of the electrocardiogram and metabolic analysis experimental methods to test the health effects on outdoor basketball players under the weather of atmospheric environmental pollution. The study found that the health effects of outdoor basketball players in polluted atmospheric weather were measured by electrocardiographic load test and metabolic analysis. It was found that before exercise, with the increase of the degree of atmospheric pollution, the trend of the effect on PEF and FEF25 was more consistent, and the negative effect of Lagt was larger, decreasing by 2.17% and 1.70%, respectively; while the effect of Lag3 and Lag2 was larger for FEF50 and FEF75, respectively (2.48% and 2.97%). After exercise, the degree of air pollution had a statistically significant (1.38%, P<0.05) effect on the same day lag of FEF25 at Lag1, FEF50 at Lag0 and Lag1(1.83%, 3.74%, P<0.05), and for PEF was with a larger negative effect at Lag1(2.63%). The study concluded that outdoor basketball sports should be reduced in the weather of atmospheric pollution environment, and certain aerobic exercises should be performed in the environment with good air quality to avoid inhalation of polluted air, which leads to lung diseases, and a scientific exercise plan and certain indoor exercises are needed in the weather of atmospheric pollution environment. On this basis, it is proposed that the exploration of the mechanism of exercise resistance to pollutant-induced organism damage, the determination of the safety threshold range of exercise in air pollution environment, and the establishment of the early warning mechanism of exercise and fitness environment pollution will be the research selections and further research focus with important scientific and practical significance in this research area.

ID INDIA-ASIA COLLISION; SOUTHERN ASIA; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS; BASINS
AB The models for quantitative study of bedrock river are two typical representatives: the Distance-slope (DS) Model and the Area-slope (AS) Model. The AS model introduces the law of the matter conservation and builds a bridge between tectonic uplift and erosion. In recent decade, AS has been widely used in the longitudinal profile simulation of bedrock and alluvial rivers, but many applications have failed to carefully consider the mechanism, fitting effect, and applicability of the resulting models, resulting in unsatisfactory simulation results. In order to verify the channel profile analysis capability of the two models, the study compared the theoretical basis and the applications of channel fitting and knickpoint identification made in the Gyirong Watershed in the middle Himalayan Orogen. It is believed that if the river meets the equilibrium condition, both models reflect the law of the matter conservation, instead of being limited to the AS. The results show that, for rivers with different equilibrium status, the two have different numerical responses on 7 bedrock rivers. The AS model has a comparative advantage in river channels with a higher degree of equilibrium, while the DS model is more suitable for longer rivers in a disequilibrium state. Finally, we applied DS model to the Gyirong Zangbo River in order to analyze the numerical characteristics of the knickzone parameters. It is found that the distribution of concave-convex intersection on the profile corresponds to the variation of the fast and slow erosion rate. This characteristic reflects the interaction between the river erosion and sedimentation in the Gyirong Watershed and is sensitive to the formation processes of the differentiated climate patterns over the past 2 Ma

DT Article
ID QUICK RESPONSE; ORDERING POLICY; COST; NEWSVENDOR; DECISIONS; BENEFIT
AB This paper investigates contracts adjustment between one manufacturer and one retailer under bilateral information updating. The manufacturer incurs uncertain production cost and the retailer faces uncertain demand, but they can acquire independent signals to update production cost and demand, respectively. They commit an initial agreement on an initial wholesale price, minimum order quantity, and information sharing as well as the transfer payment and decisions adjustment when information is updated. We find that due to the joint impact of production cost variation and market variation, the manufacturer may not decrease (increase) her wholesale price when the updated production cost is lower (higher) than expected. The retailer places an additional order even if the wholesale price rises when the market outlook is good, but places an order with the minimum order quantity even if the wholesale price falls when the market outlook is bad. Secondly, for a certain level of information accuracy of the production cost and market demand, the retailer is always better off with information updating, but the manufacturer may be worse off with information updating when facing a bad market outlook. Thirdly, when information accuracy of the production cost and market demand varies, the manufacturer only benefits from a high accuracy of production cost. Profits of the retailer and the supply chain are increasing (decreasing) with accuracy of production cost if the updated production cost is larger (smaller) than expected.

AB This work concerns the stability and stabilization problems on switched impulsive positive system. A single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter is employed for investigation and evaluation, which is a typical switched system. Then, considering the complex dynamical behaviour, a novel control scheme applying proportional with asynchronous integral and memory (PALM) control algorithm is developed to guarantee not only the positivity but also the exponential state convergence with L-1-gain performance of the hybrid system with unexpected complexity. Numerical results are illustrated to verify this proposed development. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents the design and analysis of a complex cavity that will be used in a 10 kW-level 94 GHz second harmonic low-current, low-voltage gyrotron. The mode pair of TE+7.2/TE+7.3 is selected as the operating modes of the complex cavity. In cold-cavity design, a throat is introduced in the complex cavity to increase the diffractive quality factor, which can make the gyrotron operate at low-current and low-voltage conditions. In hot-cavity analysis, the beam-wave interaction efficiency affected by different factors has been studied in detail. At the operating point with beam voltage of 32 kV and beam current of 1.5 A, the mode competition has been studied based on the analysis of starting current and a time-dependent multifrequency code; the transverse velocity spread influence on the efficiency has also been investigated. The results indicate that the operating mode eventually dominates the mode selection, while the competing modes are all at noise level. Meanwhile, the interaction efficiency can keep more than 30% with maintaining the spread below 8%, and the output power can hold at 10 kW-level when the spread is below 12%.

AB Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are a wide array of virulence factors produced by Staphylococcus aureus with potent super-antigenic activity and they were reported to be associated with sepsis-related infections, pneumonia, food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune diseases. Macrophages play important roles in innate immune responses against bacterial infections. Thus, the present study was conducted to explore the effect of SEU on macrophage activation. Seu gene was cloned from clinical Staphylococcus aureus strain related to food poisoning; then SEU protein was purified by Ni2+ column affinity chromatography. Thereafter, macrophage proliferation was analyzed with a Cell Counting Kit-8 and inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL6) secretion was assayed with the corresponding ELISA detection kit. Furthermore, western blot was used to assay inflammation-associated protein allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) expression, then the expression of AIF-1 was interfered by RNAi and the effect of SEU on macrophage proliferation and TNF-alpha, IL6 secretion was assessed again. The obtained deoxynucleotide sequence of seu gene (GenBank accession No. MH737695) shared 98.5% similarity with previously identified seu from S. aureus 383F (GenBank accession No. AY205307). SEU protein-enhanced macrophage proliferation and inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha, IL6 secretion. Furthermore, it upregulated AIF-1 expression, thereafter the expression of AIF-1 was interfered by RNAi and the interference abolished the increase of cell proliferation and inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha, IL6 secretion induced by SEU. Current results demonstrated that SEU promoted the proinflammatory activity of macrophage via upregulation of AIF-1expression.

AB In mammals, cases of male infertility have been associated with failure to develop the synaptoal complex (SC). SYCE1 (Synaptonemal complex central element protein 1) plays a rule in the assembly of SC structures essential for meiosis and reproduction. The absence of SYCE1 will lead to meiotic arrest, spermatogenetic failure and ultimately male infertility. However, molecular regulation of SYCE1 during spermatogenesis has never been reported and its function in the bovine testicular tissue remains unclean To investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of SYCE1 expression in cattleyaks, SYCE1 in RN. expression and SYCE1 gene methylation patterns in testes of yaks and cattleyaks were detected utilizing quantitative real-time PCR and hisulfite sequencing. As may have been expected, a remarkable decrease of m RNA level was detected in the testes of catdeyaks compared to that of yaks (P<0.0001). A significant increase in the methylation level of the SYCE1 gene promoter in testes was also found in the cattleyaks (78.125%) with male sterility compared with normal spermatogenesis in yaks (28.125%) (P<0.01). These results indicate that the methylation status of the SYCE1 gene promoter can regulate mRNA expression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the SYCE1 promoter is differentially methylated in testes; together with the functional promoter analysis this suggests that methylation of this promoter may contribute to cattleyak male infertility. Our findings highlighted the different expression of SYCE1 potentially influencing the assembly of SC structures in cattleyaks and provided an important framework for future researches, which may elucidate the mechanism caused by abnormal chromosomal synapsis in cattleyak meiosis and fertility.

AB Compared with the localization methods in the static sensor networks, node localization in dynamic sensor networks is more complicated due to the mobility of the nodes. Dynamic Sampling Localization Algorithm Based on Virtual Anchor (DSLA) is proposed in this paper to localize the unknown nodes in dynamic sensor networks. Firstly, DSLA algorithm predicts the speed and movement direction of nodes to determine a sector sampling area. Secondly, a method of calculating the sampling quantity with the size of the sampling area dynamically changing is proposed in this paper. Lastly, the virtual anchor node, i.e., the unknown node that got the preliminary possible area (PLA), assists the other unknown nodes to reduce their PLAs. The last PLA is regarded as a filtering condition to filter out the conflicting sample points quickly. In this way, the filtered sample is close to its real coordinates. The simulation results show that the DSLA algorithm can greatly improve the positioning performance when ensuring the execution time is shorter and the localization coverage rate is higher. The localization error of the DSLA algorithm can be dropped to about 20%.

AB The ligand effects on the structures and properties (energetics, binding energies, charge distribution and optical properties) of the (CdSe)(n) clusters (n = 3, 6, and 10) with P-containing (PH3, PH2Me, PHMe2 and PMe3) and N-containing (NH3, NH2Me, NHMe2 and NMe3) have been studied using density functional theory. The P atom and N atom in the ligands interact with Cd and form Cd-P and Cd-N bonds. The influence of P-containing ligands can be enhanced with increasing CH3 of ligands, while the N-containing ligands influence slightly change. A blueshift in absorption band was predicted for the clusters with increasing CH3 of P-containing ligands. We also found that the calculated binding energies for various ligands are found to decrease in the order PMe3 > NH2Me > NHMe2 > NH3 > NMe3 > PHMe2 > PH2Me > PH3. The use of hydrogen atom for modelling of the CdSe cluster passivating ligands is found to yield unphysical results as well.

AB Selenium-containing surfactant has aroused considerable attention due to its unique chemical properties, especially environmental sensitivity. Here we synthesized a Se-containing cationic surfactant, phenylselenide-1-undecyl trimethylammonium bromide (PSeTAB), and studied its Krafft temperature (T-K), equilibrium/dynamic surface tension, and foam properties. The results showed that with the addition of H2O2, the hydrophobic selenide group in PSeTAB was oxidized to a hydrophilic selenoxide structure, providing another polar head, and thus producing a larger geometry. As a result, PSeTAB-Ox exhibited a stronger affinity to water, lowering the T-K, tendency toward micellization and adsorption (higher cmc, less negative and ), dynamic surface activity (smaller ) and diffusion coefficients, compared to PSeTAB. Macroscopically, PSeTAB showed relatively good foaming properties, while PSeTAB-Ox has hardly any foaming ability.

AB The sulfinatodehalogenation reaction is a common method of introducing a fluoroalkyl group. In this paper, the reaction of alpha-trifluoromethylbenzyl bromide under sulfinatodehalogenation conditions was investigated. It was found that the product was an sodium alkyl sulfate (ArCH(CF3)OSO3Na) instead of an sodium alkyl sulfinate (ArCH(CF3)SO2Na) which was normal produced. alpha-Trifluoromethylbenzyl bromide did not react with the olefin after its generation of a radical intermediate under sulfinatodehalogenation conditions even though an olefin was presented. Instead, the reaction directly gave an alkyl sulfinate, and then oxidized by air to provide a product as an alkyl sulfate.

ID CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION
AB Data computation and traffic is the key step to rapid analysis and intelligent transportation application based on remote sensing data. To tackle the low computing efficiency and high storage cost in the analysis of remote sensing and improve the computational performance quickly, this paper proposed a new processing method of remote sensing data based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) sampling with non-evenly division. In the method, we first sort and preprocess the original dataset in terms of any size of one-dimension and segment the sample dataset by non-evenly division. Then the samples with the range of boundary width are reserved, and a new local unsampled mapping table is reconstructed. Next, we traverse the subset and compute the distance matrix by Euclidean distance and the local density with descending order, and further determine whether the sample belongs to boundary sample in accordance with distance matrix and local density. We then construct the sampling dataset and combine again and achieve the processing result via adding the entire unsampled mapping table to the sample dataset. Finally, the current study is tested and verified by the simulation data and true traffic jam prediction case. Our experiments present that the proposed method not only can record precisely the correspondence relations between samples and unsampled data by the KNN sampling with non-evenly division and ensure the accuracy of clustering results, but also significantly reduce the data traffic and effectively improve the memory utilization. The result reveals that the proposed method can potentially contribute to the data analysis of remote sensing data and prediction of traffic jam with large scale and high real-time performance.

DE Multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm; heuristic algorithm;
   population-based algorithm; global optimization; centroid motion
ID METAHEURISTICS
AB This paper proposes a new approach for function optimization using a new variant of multi-scale quantum harmonic optimization algorithm (MQHOA). The new approach introduces a centroid motion to improve the convergence efficiency, which is called MQHOA with centroid motion (CM-MQHOA). Instead of replacing the worst particle by the current best individual in the quantum harmonic oscillator process in MQHOA, the weakest player is replaced by a current centroid position in the proposed algorithm. Simple mechanisms are added to maintain the diversity of the population and help achieve the global optima in difficult unimodal and multimodal search spaces. The benefits of the proposed algorithm are improved performance in terms of effectiveness, reliability, accuracy, and efficiency. The approach appears to be able to efficiently deal with several unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. A variety of standard benchmark functions are used to illustrate the proposed approach. The experimental results are compared with several state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The comparative results indicate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and suggest a viable and attractive addition to the portfolio of computational intelligence techniques.

AB A novel 30-kW-class continuous wave (CW) portable water load is investigated in this paper. The Ka-band structure design and simulation including the field analysis of the output mode are carried out firstly for better high-frequency characteristics. Then the thermal effects for large power operations are analyzed through 3D simulation software. The components are fabricated, assembled, and tested successively. It is shown that the power capacity is larger than 30 kW and the measurement accuracy is acceptable according to the large power test results. Moreover, the volume and weight are both greatly reduced. These advantages make the water load investigated in this paper much suitable for application with gyrotron and tests of some other large power millimeter-wave devices.

ID ALDEHYDE REACTIVE DYES; ALUMINUM
AB Triphenodioxazine (TPDO) is a high-performance chromophore. Based on TPDO, five simultaneous or combined tanning-dyeing processes were undertaken with pickled sheep pelt. Process 1 utilized a simultaneous tanning-dyeing material named TPDO-GT, a reactive dyestuff with aldehyde reactive groups which was prepared by grafting TPDO to the backbone of a glutaraldehyde-like compound (GT). The other four processes were combinations of TPDO with gallic acid (GA) and Al (III), Fe (III) salts, through treating the pelt using a different adding order. The adding order of Process 2 was to treat the pelt with Al (III) salt first and then the mixture of (TPDO+GA); that of Process 3 was to add the mixture of (TPDO+GA) first and then the Al (III) salt; that of Process 4 was to add Fe (III) salt first and then the mixture of (TPDO+GA); that of Process 5 was to add the mixture of (TPDO+GA) first and then Fe (III) salt. Tanning dyeing effects of the five processes were compared, and the results were as follows: For hydrothermal stability (T-d from DSC analysis), 2 > 3 > 4 > 1 > 5; for colors, 1 was purple-red, 2 was dark purple, 3 was red brown, 4 was dark green, 5 was brown back; for washing fastness, 1 > 2 > 3 approximate to 4 > 5.

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; REGRESSION
AB Homonymy and polysemy are major issues in word sense disambiguation. Combining with multilayer neural network, word sense multiprototyping tackles the issues by defining multiple feature embedding representations for each word which are based on the average feature weight of the word's different context windows called prototypes. The complexity of parameter estimation of neural network regression as well as the fixed context window size are the restrictions on the implementation of word sense multiprototyping. We propose approximating the least absolute deviation (LAD) between pair-wise word frequency covariance and pair-wise word semantic relatedness by Extreme Machine Learning (ELM) with less-constraint parameter estimation. Lagrangian duality proves the method's feasibility. An in-cluster closeness calculation is performed to extract a variable context window to contextually identify multiprototypes of word senses based on Kmeans clustering. The higher accuracy of the discovered multiprototypes is verified by our experiments.

AB The alternating direction method is widely applied in total variation image restoration. However, the search directions of the method are not accurate enough. In this paper, one method based on the subspace optimization is proposed to improve its optimization performance. This method corrects the search directions of primal alternating direction method by using the energy function and a linear combination of the previous search directions. In addition, the convergence of the primal alternating direction method is proven under some weaker conditions. Thus the convergence of the corrected method could be easily obtained since it has same convergence with the primal alternating direction method. Numerical examples are given to show the performance of proposed method finally.

This paper proposes a stochastic forward-looking prediction for multi-modal fused, data. Based on the general entropy of multimodal data to indicate the total chaotic index, a stochastic model based on the general entropy is proposed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the general entropy and make the forward looking prediction for it by calculating an expected value of the predicted general index. The general index can accurately indicate the predicted uncertainty of multiple dynamic variables. An experiment is carried out for weather data fusion and the uncertainty of future weather status is simulated and then predicted. The experimental result is confirmative of our method.

By employing the method of Lyapunov function, several criteria of finite-gain L-infinity stability from disturbance to output are established. It shows that the linear delayed differential systems can be finite-gain L-infinity stabilized from disturbance to output using impulsive feedback control even there is unstable matrix. Moreover, delayed differential equations also may be finite-gain L-infinity stable from disturbance to output under an appropriate sequence of impulses treated as disturbances. Two examples and their simulations are also given to illustrate our results. (C) 2017 All rights reserved.

AB One-dimensional (1D) gold nanostructures have been extensively studied due to their potential applications in nanoelectronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, composites consisting of a well-defined linear Au-n (n = 2-4) chain encapsulated in a (9,0) single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) were studied. The translational energy barrier of a single Au atom in a (9,0) SWCNT was found to be 0.03 eV. This low barrier guaranteed the formation of Au-n@ (9,0) SWCNT (n = 1-4) composites. Bond lengths, differential charge densities, and electronic band structures of the composites were studied. The average Au-Au bond lengths in the composites were found to be almost the same as those in the corresponding free-standing linear Au-n. The average bond length increased as the number of Au atoms increased. Charge transfer in all of these composites was slight, although a few valence electrons were transferred from the (9,0) SWCNT and the Au chains to intercalations. The conductivities of the encapsulated linear Au-n (n = 2-4) chains were enhanced to some extent by encapsulating them in the SWCNT.

AB Cloud computing platforms are usually based on virtual machines as the underlying architecture; the security of virtual machine systems is the core of cloud computing security. This paper presents an immune-based intrusion detection model in virtual machines of cloud computing environment, denoted as IB-IDS, to ensure the safety of user-level applications in client virtual machines. In the model, system call sequences and their parameters of processes are used, and environment information in the client virtual machines is extracted. Then the model simulates immune responses to ensure the state of user-level programs, which can detect attacks on the dynamic runtime of applications and has high real-time performance. There are five modules in the model: antigen presenting module, signal acquisition module, immune response module, signal measurement module, and information monitoring module, which are distributed into different levels of virtual machine environment. Performance analysis and experimental results show that the model brings a small performance overhead for the virtualmachine system and has a good detection performance. It is applicable to judge the state of user-level application in guest virtual machine, and it is feasible to use it to increase the user-level security in software services of cloud computing platform.

AB Spherical LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 particles were successfully synthesized using Na2CO3 as a precipitant. Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-synthesized spherical particles deliver a high reversible capacity of above 180 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C in the voltage range of 2.8-4.4 V and display an excellent cyclic performance at 0.5 C. However, unsatisfactory rate capability was detected for the as-prepared spherical particles. The reason for the unsatisfactory rate capability was investigated through a comparison of the properties of the as-synthesized spherical particles versus the ball-milled samples via a combination of specific surface areas test, electronic conductivity measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that both the rate capabilities of cathode materials and the electronic conductivities of the mixtures of active material, conductive additive, and binder are highly improved when the secondary spherical particles were broken, indicating that the poor electronic conductivity of electrode caused by the large secondary spherical particles with a great amount of nano-pores is a significant factor for the unsatisfactory rate capability.

AB The density gradient of fast ions is the main driving force for fishbone instability that in turn results in fast ion loss. It is possible to reduce the instability by eliminating the density gradient of the fast ions by employing dual neutral beam injection (DNBI) in tokamak plasmas. The dispersion relation for the fishbone instability is applied to the case of DNBI with suitable fast ion distribution functions. The results show that the density distribution of fast ions of DNBI can bring about a stable window that is a range of values for the distance between the on-axis beam and the off-axis beam that yields an overall stabilization of the resultant fishbone mode. The width of the stable window increases linearly with the position of the safety factor q = 1 magnetic flux surface increasing. In addition, the width of the stable window becomes wider for a more peaked density profile of fast ions and keeps constant for a peaked enough density profile of fast ions. The growth rates of the fishbone modes dramatically decrease with the intensity ratio of off-axis neutral beam injection (NBI) and on-axis NBI, and the critical beta values of fast ions increase with the intensity ratio increasing. Fishbone modes can be avoided with DNBI, which may be an effective method to prevent fast ion loss resulting from fishbone instabilities.

AB Silver-deposited magnetic nanoparticles (PDA-Fe3O4@Ag) were prepared though the seed-mediated method exploiting the adsorption of silver ions by the polydopamine (PDA) which was coated on the surface of Fe3O4. The preparation process was studied using UV-Vis spectra and the prepared nanoparticles were characterized with several analytical techniques including Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The catalytic action on the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and the antibacterial property of PDA-Fe3O4@Ag were studied. The result indicates that the existence of gold seeds is the key to prepare PDA-Fe3O4@Ag nanoparticles. The magnetic catalyst can be separated easily from the reaction system by applied magnetic field, and still has good catalytic performance after repeated recycling. In addition, PDA-Fe3O4@Ag nanoparticles exhibit bactericidal properties, and still shows good bactericidal effect on S. aureus after recycling use for 5 times.

The methods used in this research could be adopted to distinguish one to five-year-old Radix Panacis Quinquefolii imported from Canada, which is available or presented as mixtures in the raw root selling markets in China. The peduncle of terminal umbel, starch grain, calcium oxalate cluster crystals and secretory canal and the number of "Lo Bowl" characteristics have been presented. It is therefore suggested that the roots could be used to authenticate the one to five-year-old P. quinquefolius grown in Canada.

X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the crystal structures of the films. Transmission electronic microscope was used to analyze the surface and the interface morphology of the films. Ferroelectric properties were showed by measuring the remnant polarization and the leakage current dependence of electric field. The results indicated that it was good for reducing lead loss and annealing temperature of PZT films by microwave plasma assisted annealing. Ferroelectric properties of the film could also be enhanced by this pilot annealing method.

AB The study was conducted to compare differentially expressed proteins in the testes of adult yaks (Bos grunniens) and sterile cattle-yaks, in order to elucidate mechanisms of hybrid male sterility. Total proteins were extracted from testes and subject to 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identification. A total of 19 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 13 were downregulated and 4 upregulated in cattle-yak testes. Interestingly, two chaperones (T-complex protein 1 and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) with decreased expressions in the testes of cattle-yaks were revealed, however, their association with the hybrid sterility is unclear. Protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 was decreased by over 8-folds in the testes of cattle-yaks than yaks, and may be associated with cell cycle arrest during spermatogenesis. Several proteins involved in male fertility and/or energy metabolism were also identified, such as mitochondrial peroxiredoxin-5 and sorbitol dehydrogenase. In addition, N (G), N (G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which can increase the production of nitric oxide and affect normal spermatogenesis in testis, was upregulated in cattle-yak testes. The increased expression of DDAH is probably associated with male sterility of cattle-yaks. The results of this study suggest that the mechanisms of male sterility of cattle-yaks might be associated with many proteins of diverse functions, and some proteins such as chaperones and testis-specific proteins may play important roles.

AB High-quality ZnSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals were synthesized by a convenient aqueous phase method, achieving epitaxial growth at a very low temperature of 900. The nature of the ZnS shells grown on the surfaces of ZnSe core nanocrystals (average size, 4 similar to 5 nm) was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, photoluminescence (PL) measurements, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The PL intensity of ZnSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) first increased and then decreased with increasing pH value. The strongest PL intensity occurs at the pH value of similar to 10.5. The strongest PL peak was centered at 400 nm (FWHM similar to 22 nm). The mechanism of the observed optical properties is discussed.

AB Electrochemical attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) has been used to investigate the facet-dependent adsorption and oxidation of CO on the {100}-preferred Pt nanocrystals (NCs). The cyclic voltammogram for the synthesized and then cleaned Pt NCs in a sulfuric acid solution displayed four pairs of redox peaks. The peaks located at 0.26 and 0.36 V were attributed to interfacial hydrogen electro-adsorption/desorption processes on the short-and long-range Pt{100} domains, respectively. Furthermore, the Pt{100} and Pt{111} domains were estimated to account for 34% and 14% of the active sites on the surfaces of the Pt NCs, respectively, based on Bi and Ge irreversible adsorption methods. Potential-dependent spectral features can be used to differentiate the adsorption and oxidation processes of linearly adsorbed CO (COL) species on the three basic planes of the Pt NCs. COL species on the Pt{110} facets were oxidized preferentially, followed sequentially by those on the Pt{111} and Pt{100} facets. COL on Pt(100) required the highest overpotential for their oxidation.

AB For d(3) in covalent compounds with tetragonal symmetry, this paper presents a complete energy matrix, in which the different covalence of t(2) and e orbitals is considered not only in the electrostatic repulsions part of energy matrix elements but also in the crystal-field potential part of energy matrix elements. With taking and no taking the crystal field parameter B-00(0) into account, the effect of covalence on the energy levels of d(3) ions system were investigated, respectively. The investigation shows that it is very necessary for considering the different covalence of t(2) and e orbitals in both electrostatic repulsions part and crystal-field potential part when the optical properties of d(3) ions in strong covalent compounds with tetragonal symmetry is investigated. On the other hand, the crystal field parameter B-00(0), has a significant effect on the energy levels, and should be considered in investigations of d(3) ions in strong covalent compounds with tetragonal symmetry. Application to calculating the energy levels for Co2+ in CdGa2Se4, the calculated results are in agreement with the experiment data (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
