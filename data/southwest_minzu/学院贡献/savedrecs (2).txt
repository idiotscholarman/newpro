AB Recently, the stimulus-sensitive drug co-delivery system has gained increasing attentions in the clinic and exhibits improved efficiency rather than the mono-chemotherapy in anti-tumor therapy. Herein, the smart charge switchable nano-micelles (NMs) were fabricated for the endosomal escape mediated co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and paclitaxel (PTX) in treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. The disulfide bonds were facilitated as the linker of the polymer backbone to achieve the redox-sensitive degradation by high intracellular GSH, and acidliable DMMA was grafted onto DOX molecules for pH-triggered drug release under acidic tumoral microenvironment. Folic acid (FA) was utilized as targeting molecule for facilitating entry of the as prepared NMs into cancer cells. Remarkably, the as fabricated NMs exhibited surface charge-switch from negative to positive during transmitting from physiological pH to the tumor extracellular pH, which can improve the cellular internalization towards cancer cell. Subsequently, the "proton-sponge" effect mediated endosome escape of the NMs was facilitated in the acidic endo/lysosome environment. By the cell assay, the NMs possessed good biocompatibility, excellent cellular uptake, and improved inhibition rate against cancer cell. Moreover, the co-delivery of DOX/ PTX exhibited synergistic and enhanced solid tumor inhibition efficiency comparing to mono-chemotherapy in A-549 tumor bearing mice model. Based on above experimental results, the as prepared drug co-delivery system showed promising biosafety and potentials for efficient lung adenocarcinoma treatment in clinic.

AB Data delivery in harsh underwater channels consumes a higher transmission power than that in terrestrial networks. However, due to the complexity of the underwater environment, the energy supply of the nodes in underwater wireless sensor networks is usually limited by their required laborious battery replacement. Thus, energy consumption is considered one of the key issues in underwater wireless optical communication. To minimize such consumption for underwater transmission nodes, much research interest has been found on K-Means technology in designing routing algorithms. However, these algorithms have not regarded the located site and the remaining energy of the underwater nodes simultaneously, which might affect their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a clustered routing algorithm, namely the location and energy-aware k-means clustered routing (LE-KCR) algorithm, which applies K-means technology regarding both the located site and the remaining energy of each node. In the proposed LE-KCR algorithm, both the located site and the remaining energy of a candidate cluster-head, as well as the distance between it and its sink node, are considered in cluster-head selection. In addition, given the inaccessibility of some nodes to the whole underwater sensor network resulting from the limited transmission range of their clusters, the dual-hop routing technique is adopted for the edge nodes. The simulation results indicate that the proposed LE-KCR algorithm remarkably reduces the energy consumption and the dead nodes when compared to the traditional low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol and the optimized LEACH protocol based on K-means clustering technology.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is now a well acknowledged indicator for diverse clinical diseases correlated with its abnormal expression. Compared to the assays by traditional and lately emerging methods, the fluorescent (FL) sensing, especially in the turn-on mode, has become more favored due to its simplicity, low cost, and high sensitivity and precision. However, the feasible FL probes are still limited and suffering from poor biological compatibility, complex preparation, additional modification or function-alization. Herein, we found that one common metal-organic framework, UiO-66-NH2 at nanoscale, could act as a new and label-free FL probe for facile sensing of ALP in the turn-on mode, based on the simple aid by phenyl phosphate which could be hydrolyzed by ALP, with the product of phosphate ion enhancing the FL emission of UiO-66-NH2 via simple adsorption. Unlike many other FL probes in the turn-on mode, it was unnecessary to quench the FL of the probes in advance, greatly simplifying the sensor design. Moreover, by use of a new method based on dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), the UiO-66-NH2 could be prepared in 10 min, much shorter than that (usually hours) for preparing most other FL probes for ALP assay. The limit of detection was 0.4 U L-1, superior or at least rivalrous to the previously reported ones, and the ALP assay was also accomplished for real serum samples, with the analytical results highly consistent with those obtained by the clinical procedures, revealing its high practical utility.

AB Based on coopetition literature, we deconstruct alliance coopetition to horizontal coopetition and vertical coopetition, so as to pursue deeper insight into the impacts of different types of alliance coopetition on breakthrough innovation in the context of the firm's knowledge resource endowment. Drawing on the data extracted from 222 Chinese firms, we theorise and demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between alliance coopetition and breakthrough innovation and the incentive of alliance coopetition on breakthrough innovation performance is contingent on the resource integration ability of firms. In addition, we find the knowledge ambiguity positively moderates the direct effect of horizontal coopetition on firms' resource integration, but negatively moderates the effect of vertical coopetition on firms' resource integration. Our findings help to clarify the controversial relation between coopetition and innovation studies.

AB Sanggenone C, oxyresveratrol, catechin and L-epicatechin exist in Morus and Hulless Barley as natural polyphenols with antityrosinase activity. Little research on their synergistic and structure-function relationships of them has been reported in recent years. In this paper, the inhibition mechanisms of these four plant polyphenols were investigated by enzyme kinetics, HPLC, fluorescence spectra, and molecular docking methods. The results showed that oxyresveratrol (IC50 = 1.096 +/- 0.048 mu g/mL), sanggenone C (IC50 = 13.360 +/- 1.029 mu g/mL), L-cepicatechin (IC50 = 55.730 +/- 1.762 mu g/mL), and catechin (IC50 = 148.500 +/- 3.355 mu g/mL) exhibited tyrosinase inhibition activity. When sangenone C (14 mu g/mL) was mixed with L-epicatechin (56 mu g/mL) at 4:1 (40 mu L + 10 mu L), the highest tyrosinase inhibition was achieved. Molecular docking showed that the number and position of phenolic hydroxyls of polyphenols were the key for tyrosinase inhibition activity. This study provided new ideas for the application of these four plant polyphenols from Hulless Barley and Morus as tyrosinase inhibitors in food preservation.

AB The evaluation of tourism competitiveness is an important tool for analyzing the potential of tourism in a specific context. Enshi Autonomous Prefecture (EAP) in China is selected as a case through which to explore the potential of mountain tourism and its competitiveness in the tourism industry. This study develops EAP's mountain tourism competitiveness model focusing on three criteria: core competitiveness of mountain tourism, the economic environment's competitiveness, and infrastructure competitiveness. Context-specific customized evaluation index has been applied to data collected from EAP Statistical Yearbook for 2005-2014. The study reveals that the value of EAP's mountain tourism core competitiveness, economic and environmental competitiveness, and infrastructure competitiveness are 84.292, 13.4, and 2.308%, respectively. When tourism core competitiveness is increased by one unit, EAP's mountain tourism competitiveness will increase by 0.84292 units. Similarly, when economic environment competitiveness is increased by one unit, EAP's mountain tourism competitiveness will increase by 0.134 units. EAP's mountain tourism competitiveness increases by 0.02308 units when infrastructure competitiveness increases by one unit. The major reasons for low levels of competitiveness were lack of awareness of the county authority, a low level of cooperation, and weak infrastructure. The recommendations from the study's findings are as follows. Firstly, the county authority should appropriately improve the relationship between competition and cooperation, maintaining cooperation in competition, and competition in cooperation. Secondly, the county authority should strengthen communication by establishing an effective coordinated mechanism. Thirdly, the county authority should improve the sense of cooperation and jointly develop the mountain tourism market. Fourthly, the county authority should improve the construction of tourism infrastructure and break down the barriers to tourism cooperation. The study's findings help develop a "win-win" cooperation mechanism within the competition and support the sustainable development of the mountain tourism industry while reducing poverty and promoting the revitalization of the mountains of China.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have made greatcontribution to revealing structural and functional mechanisms formany biomolecular systems. However, how to identify functional statesand important residues from vast conformation space generated by MDremains challenging; thus an intelligent navigation is highly desired.Despite intelligent advantages of deep learning exhibited in analyzingMD trajectory, its black-box nature limits its application. To addressthis problem, we explore an interpretable convolutional neural network(CNN)-based deep learning framework to automatically identifydiverse active states from the MD trajectory for G-protein-coupledreceptors (GPCRs), named the ICNNMD model. To avoid theinformation loss in representing the conformation structure, the pixelrepresentation is introduced, and then the CNN module is constructedto efficiently extract features followed by a fully connected neuralnetwork to realize the classification task. More importantly, we design a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation interpreter forthe classification result by local approximation with a linear model, through which important residues underlying distinct active statescan be quickly identified. Our model showcases higher than 99% classification accuracy for three important GPCR systems withdiverse active states. Notably, some important residues in regulating different biased activities are successfully identified, which arebeneficial to elucidating diverse activation mechanisms for GPCRs. Our model can also serve as a general tool to analyze MDtrajectory for other biomolecular systems. All source codes are freely available athttps://github.com/Jane-Liu97/ICNNMDforaiding MD studies

AB Recently, the treatment of nuclear industry wastewater has attracted much attention. However, due to the high energy consumption and low removal efficiency of the traditional treatment method, it is not suitable for the treatment of nuclear industry wastewater. Here, a dual-chamber Microbial fuel cell (MFC) with carbon-felt based Iron/Magnesium/Zirconium polycrystalline catalytic cathode is constructed to remove radioactive ions in low concentration nuclear industry wastewater. After biofilm formation on the anode surface, a steady voltage output of 0.8 V is recorded, and the dual-chamber microbial fuel cell obtains a maximum power density of 1.4 W m(-2) at the catholyte of pH 2, which is superior to Pt/C cathode. Moreover, the removal efficiency of the dual chamber microbial fuel cell for radioactive ions exceeds 80%, and the removal efficiency for lanthanum and cerium is over 98% at the ion concentration of 5 mg L-1. This low-cost and high-performance bioelectrochemical system (BES) called microbial fuel cells opens a new exploration door to remove radioactive ions in nuclear industry wastewater with electricity production.

AB A reduced graphene oxide-polydopamine-carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotube (RGO-PDA-cMWCNT) nanocomposite was fabricated via a facile, one-pot procedure and was characterized by a variety of techniques. A novel electrochemical sensor based on RGO-PDA-cMWCNT was constructed to determine hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CT) simultaneously. This newly prepared nanocomposite shows excellent electrocatalytic efficacy in the electrode reaction of the two isomers. Specifically, the peak-to-peak potential difference between the two dihydroxybenzenes is 115 mV for oxidation, which is obviously larger than similar electrochemical sensors. The established method displays a wide linear range from 0.5 to 5000 mu M with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.066 mu M for HQ and 0.073 mu M for CT. In addition, this electrochemical approach has been tested to measure the two dihydroxybenzenes in real samples and satisfactory results were recorded.

AB Lithium (Li) metal has extremely high theoretical specific capacity and low redox potential, which can greatly improve energy density of Li battery. Nevertheless, some troubles including Li dendrite, parasitic reaction and volumetric change extremely restrict its practical application. Herein, a strategy of combining 3D composite lithium metal and surface modification is proposed for solving these issues simultaneously. The 3D composite lithium metal electrode is synthesized by infusing molten Li into Cu foam, and multilevel micro-nano structure is obtained by alloying reaction between Li and surface part of Cu foam, which can be used as three-dimensional (3D) scaffold with high specific surface area. The surface modification of coating zinc fluoride (ZnF2) is used as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The symmetric cell using modified composite Li anode exhibits stable electrochemical performance and long cycling lifespan. And the excellent performance of LiCoO2 (LCO) cell (average 121 mAh g-1) is achieved, compared to pristine Li of 114 mAh g-1.

AB Forests are essential biomes for global biochemical cycles, and soil microorganisms play a key role in providing and maintaining forest ecosystem services. A comprehensive understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors drive soil microbial community composition can help predict the effects of environmental changes on forest ecosystem service functions. Therefore, this study was conducted in a subalpine coniferous forest (Picea asperata forests and Sabina chinensis forests) in the Sanjiangyuan National Natural Reserve of Qinghai Province, China, to investigate the effects of understorey vegetation on soil microbial communities by measuring shrub roots, herbaceous roots, litter and soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial communities (16S, ITS). The results showed the following: (1) In both the P. asperata and S. chinensis forests, the dominant phyla in the soil bacterial communities were Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, and the dominant phyla in the fungal communities were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. In different forest types, the soil microbial communities contained differences that were significant in beta diversity (P 0.05) and nonsignificant in alpha diversity (P 0.05). (2) Results from the structural equation model showed that in different forest types, bacterial community composition was significantly influenced by herbaceous roots, while fungal community composition was significantly influenced by shrub roots (P < 0.05), and the degree of influence was stronger than that of litter. In addition, both the shrub and herbaceous roots showed the direct influence on soil microbial communities, but not on the soil bacterial communities of S. chinensis forests, in which the shrub and herbaceous roots had an indirect influence on bacterial community composition through affecting soil physicochemical properties and keystone species of the bacterial communities. Therefore, in subalpine coniferous forests, the effects of under storey shrubs and herbs on soil microbial communities are more significant than those of litter. The conservation of understorey vegetation community diversity and productivity is equally important for maintaining forest ecosystem service functions and stability.

AB Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal element, cumulates in the testis and can cause male reproductive toxicity. Although vitamin E (VE) as one of potential antioxidants protects the testis against toxicity of Cd, the underlying mechanism remained uncompleted clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the Nrf-2 pathway is involved with the protective effect of VE on testicular damages caused by sub-chronic Cd exposure. Thirty-two SD rats were divided into four groups and orally administrated with VE and/or Cd for 28 consecutive days: control group, VE group (100 mg VE/kg), Cd group (5 mg CdCl2/kg), and VE + Cd group (100 mg VE/kg + 5 mg CdCl2/kg). The results showed that 28-day exposure of Cd caused accumulation of Cd, histopathological lesions, and alternations of sperm parameters (elevated rate of abnormal sperm, decreased count of sperm, declined motility, and viability of sperm). Moreover, the rats exposed to Cd showed significant oxidative stress (increased contents of MDA and decreased levels or activities of T-AOC, GSH, CAT, SOD and GSH-Px) and inhibition of Nrf-2 signaling pathway (downregulation of Nrf-2, HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC, GCLM and GST) of the testes. In contrast, VE treatment significantly reduced the Cd accumulation, alleviated histopathological lesions and dysfunctions, activated Nrf-2 pathway, and attenuated the oxidative stress caused by Cd in the testes of rats. In conclusion, VE, through upregulating Nrf-2 pathway, could protect testis against oxidative damages induced by sub-chronic Cd exposure.

AB Global nitrogen (N) deposition generally reduces plant biodiversity and changes ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. Light limitation caused by accumulated litter under N enrichment is proposed as a main reason for the decreases of biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration. However, mechanisms underlying this light limitation effect are not well understood, especially under different N input rates. We conducted a field manipulation experiment with N addition as the primary factor nested with litter manipulation as the secondary factor in an alpine meadow in 2017, measured ecosystem C fluxes and investigated the plant communities about 10 days after the N addition treatment, to examine the responses of biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration to litter manipulation and N addition. Our results showed that alleviation of light limitation by removing litter increased plant species richness under N enrichment, which principally caused by higher species gains and lower losses. Common and rare species contributed most of the increased species as light limitation was relieved. N addition had no significant impact on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), whereas alleviation of light limitation and the subsequent increase in plant coverage and density under N enrichment stimulated gross primary productivity (GPP) but did not affect ecosystem respiration (ER), causing positive responses of NEP. This study highlights the promoting effect of the enhanced light availability through litter removal on species diversity and ecosystem C sequestration under N enrichment. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying light limitation influence on biodiversity and ecosystem C sequestration under N enrichment. We suggest that grassland management by removing the accumulated litter is an adaptive way to enhance light availability, mitigate diversity loss and thus increase C sequestration under eutrophication.

TI CO2 and Temperature Control over Nanoaggregates in
   Surfactant-Free Microemulsion
SO LANGMUIR
LA English
DT Article
AB Smart microemulsions (MEs) recently have at- tracted significant interests. However, MEs, especially surfactant-free MEs (SFMEs) that respond to more than one stimulus, are rarely reported to date. Here, we reported the first example of dual-responsive SFME in which a CO2-sensitive hydroxyethylamine was used as an amphisolvent. This SFME was investigated utilizing ternary phase diagram, dynamic light scattering, and UV-visible spectrum techniques. It was found that three hydroxyethylamines could stabilize the octanol-water mixture to form transparent and isotropic SFMEs including nanoaggregates-rich pre-ouzo zone, regardless of the number of the hydroxyl group. Among them, 2-(dimethyl amino) ethanol (DMEA)-based SFME possesses the largest single-phase region and most sensitive to CO2 and the changes in temperature. With bubbling of CO2/N-2 or decreasing/increasing temperature, both the single-phase region and pre-ouzo zone reversibly shrink and expand, as well as with breathing. However, CO2/N-2-induced change is more significant than that induced by temperature. The former is mainly ascribed to the reversible protonation and deprotonation of DMEA, while the latter is generally interpreted as the effects of temperature on hydrogen bond interaction. Note that CO2 leads to a thorough demusification from Winsor IV ME to oil-rich and water-rich two phases without nanoaggregates, while cooling only causes to a particular phase separation, producing two new MEs phases, not typical Winsor I or II MEs. Such a unique dual-responsive SFME can not only be applied in the remediation of contaminated soil, drug delivery, and nanoparticles preparation but also opens a new door to switchable emulsion.

TI Analysis of long non-coding RNAs in epididymis of cattleyak associated

AB Cattleyak (CY), is a cross breed between cattle and yak (YK), which display equal adaptability to the harsh environment as YK and much higher performances than YK. However, the CY is female fertile and male sterile. Previous studies were conducted on testes tissues to investigate the mechanism of male infertility in CY. There is no systematic research on genes, especially lncRNAs between CY and YK epididymis. In this study, Illumina Hiseq was performed to profile the epididymis transcriptome (lncRNA and mRNA) of CY and YK. In total 18859 lncRNAs were identified, from which lincRNAs 12458, antisense lncRNAs 2345, intronic lncRNAs 3101, and sense lncRNAs 955 respectively. We have identified 345 DE lncRNAs and 3008 DE mRNAs between YK and CY epididymis. Thirteen DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Combing with DEG, 14 couples of lncRNAs and their target genes were both DE, and 6 of them including CCDC39, KCNJ16, NECTIN2, MRPL20, PSMC4, and DEFB112 show their potential infertility-related terms such as cellular motility, sperm maturation, sperm storage, cellular junction, folate metabolism, and capacitation. On the other hand, several down-regulated genes such as DEFB124, DEFB126, DEFB125, DEFB127, DEFB129, CES5A, TKDP1, CST3, RNASE9 and CD52 in CY compared to YK were involved in the immune response and sperm maturation. Therefore, comprehensive analysis for lncRNAs and their target genes may enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of sperm maturation in CY and may provide important resources for further research.

AB Capacitor current ripple (CCR) control is applied to single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter due to its advantages in reducing cross regulation and fast transient response. However, it shows that the stability of CCR-controlled SIDO CCM buck converter can be affected by circuit parameters. In this article, a 5-D discrete iterative map model of CCR-controlled SIDO CCM buck converter is established based on Poincar maps. The bifurcation analysis and eigenvalues loci clearly shows that the effect of control parameters and load parameters on the stability of CCR-controlled SIDO CCM buck converter. Besides, the effect of studied circuit parameters on the stability range of the converter is investigated. Furthermore, the stability boundaries and stable regions of load parameters and control parameters are obtained by using eigenvalues analysis. The study results show that the increasing of proportional parameters would cause instability and it will reduce the stable region of load parameters. The converter has a stable region for load parameters and these two load parameters have influence on each other. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis in this article.

AB Bovine kobuvirus (BKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense, non-enveloped RNA virus in genus Kobuvirus of family Picornavirus. BKV was first identified in the culture media of HeLa cell containing calf serum in 2003. Since then, BKV has been detected in 13 countries of four different continents, suggesting widespread in the world. Herein, we review the detection and genomic characterization of BKV in 13 countries. All studies tested bovine faecal samples for BKV. These studies provide evidence that BKV might be a causative agent for neonatal calf diarrhoea. Therefore, further efforts including animal challenge study are urgently needed to unveil the pathogenicity of BKV.

AB An iron-catalyzed cascade reaction of radical reduction of allyl alcohols and acetylenic acids to construct polysubstituted alpha-alkenyl lactones has been developed. In this paper, various allyl alcohols can form allyl ester intermediates and are further transformed into alkyl radicals, which form products through intramolecular reflex-Michael addition. In addition, this method can be used to prepare spirocycloalkenyl lactones. Interestingly, this protocol can be used to synthesize the skeleton structure of natural products. Moreover, the product can be further transformed into a beta-methylene tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran diene.

AB In this work, hydrophobic upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were transformed into hydrophilic NPs via the rapid oxidative polymerization of dopamine (DA) induced by NaIO4 in a water-in-oil microemulsion system. The polydopamine (PDA)-coated UCNPs synthesized using NaIO4 as the oxidant exhibited a positive charge (+26.4 mV) at pH 7.0. Those prepared using ambient O-2 as the oxidant had a negative charge (-15.4 mV). The difference in the composition between PDA-coated UCNPs using NaIO4 (UCNPs@PDA-NaIO4) and those using ambient O-2 (UCNPs@PDA-O-2) as oxidants was supported by the XPS and FTIR results. The difference in the surface charges may be due to variation in the composition, which probably attributed to the different oxidants used. A series of controlled experiments were carried out to infer the origination of the positive charges of UCNPs@PDA-NaIO4. Furthermore, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) were deposited on UCNPs@PDA-NaIO4 where PDA served as both the reductant and the stabilizer so that additional reagents and thermal treatments were not necessary. The effect of pH on the deposition of Au NPs was also studied. In addition, the load density of Au NPs on the surface of the PDA-coated UCNPs could be adjusted by changing the dosage of HAuCl4, which could effectively enhance the upconversion luminescence (UCL) intensity. This work provides a method to regulate the surface charge of the PDA coating, and the nanocomposites with unique properties synthesized by this method may be employed in biological imaging, diagnostic analysis, and other biological fields.

AB An efficient NIS-promoted two-step radical addition of thiols to allenamides was developed to create a workable route to 1,3-dithioethers. The reaction exhibited good functional group tolerance and high efficiency, affording the products in good to excellent yields. Moreover, cyclic dithioethers could be obtained by using 1,2-dithiols as substrates. Mechanistic investigations including calculation study indicated that a two-step radical process is likely involved in this transformation.

AB Triptolide (TP), a broad-spectrum antitumor drug, has very poor solubility and oral bioavailability, which limits its clinical use. Compared with conventional formulations of TP, a casein (Cas)-based drug delivery system has been reported to have significant advantages for the improvement of solubility and bioavailability of insoluble drugs. In this paper, we report the successful preparation of TP-loaded Cas nanoparticles (FP-Cas) using the self-assembly characteristics of Cas in water and the optimization of the formulation by evaluation of entrapment efficiency (EE) and loading efficiency (LE). Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was adopted to characterize the TP-Cas. Results showed that the obtained TP-Cas were approximately spherical with a particle size of 128.7 +/- 11.5 nm, EE of 72.7 +/- 4.7 %, and LE of 8.0% +/- 0.5%. Furthermore, in vitro release behavior of TP-Cas in PBS (pH = 7.4) was also evaluated, showing a sustained-release profile. Additionally, an in vivo study in rats displayed that the mean plasma concentration of TP after oral administration of TP-Cas was significantly higher than that treated with TP oral suspension. The C-max value for TP-Cas (8.0 4 +/- 4 mu g/mL) was significantly increased compared with the free TP (0.9 +/- 0.3 mu g/mL). Accordingly, the area under the curve (AUC(0-8)) of TP-Cas was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mg/L.h, 4.3-fold higher than that of TP suspension (0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/L.h). Therefore, it can be concluded that TP-Cas enhanced the absorption and improved oral bioavailability of TP. Taking the good oral safety of Cas into consideration, TP-Cas should be a more promising preparation of TP for clinical application.

AB BACKGROUND Probiotics regulate host immune balance, which may reduce immune-related diseases. The effects and mechanisms ofLactobacillus rhamnosus2016SWU.05.0601 (Lr-0601) on the immune response in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice were explored. RESULTS Lr-0601 reduced serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and OVA-IgE and attenuated the alteration in lung pathology in OVA-sensitized mice. Lr-0601 blocked OVA-induced up-regulation in serum T helper (Th) 2 and Th17 cytokines but increased the serum levels of Th1 and regulatory T (Treg) cytokines in OVA-sensitized mice. OVA also markedly reduced the protein levels of spleen T-box transcription factor and forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3, leading to the reduced mRNA expression of interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10. By contrast, OVA markedly increased the protein expression of spleen GATA-binding protein 3 and retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t, as well as the mRNA expression of spleen IL-4 and IL-17. These changes induced by OVA were reversed by Lr-0601. Moreover, Lr-0601 helped alleviate OVA-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. A correlation was found between specific genera and immune-associated cytokines. CONCLUSION The combined results indicate that Lr-0601 modulated the balance of Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 in OVA-sensitized mice, which was associated with the regulation of immune-related transcription factors and gut microbiota. Lr-0601 can potentially be used as a probiotic for preventing immune-related diseases. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB The exposure of wounds and improper wound care can inevitably increase the occurrence of bacterial infection, thus highlighting the necessity of engineering antibacterial wound dressings due to the increasing demand for accelerating wound healing. In this contribution, we firstly synthesized a novel antibacterial N-halamine incorporated polymer (AP) and followed by the blending of AP and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and the further processing of the blend into nanofibrous membrane (NM) using electrospinning. The synthesized AP and prepared NMs were fully characterized in terms of structure, morphology, mechanical property, surface wettability, UV stability, cytocompatibility and antibacterial performance. Results showed that the prepared NMs show a powerful behavior against Gram positive S. aureus (ATCC6538), Gram negative E. coli (ATCC8739) and fungi involved with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ATCC9763) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC16404). Furthermore, the rechargeable property of NMs was facilely demonstrated by a chlorination process, during which, the content of active chlorine could regenerate to around 80 % and the reusability of NM was studied in terms of the spinnability and antibacterial performance. Overall, the successful preparation of AP and NMs with desirable antibacterial property, cytocompatibility, processability, and reusability at present holds a great potential for accelerating wound healing in a sustainable and structurally adaptive form.

AB Yak is an iconic species of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is the world's highest plateau. Here, a total of 541 yak diarrhoeic samples were collected from 69 farms in four provinces in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from April 2015 to June 2018, and 73.6 % of samples were detected as Bovine Rotavirus A (BRVA) positive by RT-PCR assay. Two G genotypes (G6, G10) and two P genotypes (P[1], P[11]) were determined, in which G6P[1] BRVA was the predominant strain. Moreover, VP7 and VP4 of these G6P[1] strains showed unique amino acid mutations, such that they clustered into an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree. A strain of BRVA designated as RVA/Yak-tc/CHN/QH-1/2015/G6P[1] was isolated successfully using MA104 cells, and the virus titre was determined as 10(5.84) TCID 50 ml(-1). The genome of strain QH-1 had a G6-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N3-T6-E2-H3 genotype constellation. QH-1 was identified as a reassortment strain of BRVA, human RVA and ovine RVA based on the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic tree of 11 gene segments, indicating its public health significance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the molecular prevalence and genome characteristics of BRVA in yak, contributing to further understanding of the epidemic and genetic evolution of BRVA.

AB This paper investigates two novel distributed algorithms based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for network resource allocation of N agents. The main objective is to derive an optimal allocation that minimizes a global objective expressed as a sum of locally known separable convex objective functions. Based on a communication matrix, the dual resource allocation problem is changed into a consensus optimization problem, in which each agent broadcasts the outcome of its local processing to all his neighbors. In this paper, we first propose a new distributed dual consensus ADMM (DC-ADMM) algorithm to address this consensus problem. Moreover, by applying an inexact step for each ADMM update, a distributed inexact DC-ADMM (IDC-ADMM) is also developed, which enables agents to perform cheap computation at each iteration. Finally, numerical simulations are delivered to illustrate and validate the proposed algorithm.

AB A metal-free cross-dehydrogenative coupling of quinones with toluene derivatives has been established. A series of quinones were subjected to reaction with toluene derivatives in the presence of di-tertbutyl peroxide (DTBP) for direct synthesis of benzylquinones. The method exhibits good functional group tolerance, and desired products were obtained in moderate to good yields. Meanwhile, a radical pathway was proposed to describe the cross-dehydrogenative coupling of quinones with toluene derivatives.

AB Aim: To identify whether PD-L1 expression and EGFR status are associated with response to treatment benefit in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Methods: The relevant studies were retrieved and systematic evaluation was conducted. Databases were searched until November 2018. Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 6932 patients were included. Patients with the higher PD-L1 expression level tend to have a longer progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in all the subgroups of PD-L1 expression levels. For patients with PD-L1 expression levels of >= 1%, overall response rates were significantly prolonged, but there was no difference in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of <1% (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.87-3.52; p = 0.12). EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients could benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in PFS (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01) and OS (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.62-0.73; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: This study indicates that PD-L1-positive or EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients might get potential benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

The potential applications of graphene in pollution remediation are adsorption, membrane separation, catalysis, environmental analysis, and so on. The adsorption efficiency of graphene adsorbents largely depends on its surface area, porous structure, oxygen-containing groups and other functional groups, adsorption conditions, and also the properties of adsorbates. With appropriate modifications, graphene materials are mostly efficient adsorbents for organic pollutants (e.g. dyes, pesticides, and oils) and inorganic pollutants (e.g. metal ions, nonmetal ions, and gas). Since our first report of graphene adsorbents in 2010, plenty of studies have been dedicated to developing various graphene adsorbents and to evaluating their performance in treating contaminated water. Recently, there is a growing trend in graphene adsorbents that could be applied in soil remediation, where the situation is much more complicated than in aqueous systems. Herein, we review the design of graphene adsorbents for water treatment and analyze their potential in soil remediation. Several suggestions to accelerate the research on graphene-based soil remediation technology are proposed.

AB Allylic N,N-acetals are important intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active heterocycles and natural products. Herein, we report a facile protocol for the synthesis of this compound through N-iodosuccinimide-mediated hydroamination of allenamides by imidazole heterocycles. The reaction is regioselective, fast, and tolerant of a broad scope of imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives. The key intermediate is a conjugated sulfimide ion species that undergoes nucleophilic attack by imidazole to form the 1,2-adduct. Mixtures of N-1- and N-3-substituted isomers were obtained using asymmetrically substituted imidazoles. However, the 1,4-adduct was obtained using a tri-substituted imidazole. The efficiency of the gram-scale reaction suggests the potential industrial application of this synthetic method.

AB Scale deposits exist widely in industrial water-cooling systems and oil-production systems, causing severe damage to the equipment. The most effective way to prevent the formation of scale has been to use an inhibitor. The use of a hyperbranched polymer as an inhibitor, however, has rarely been reported. In this study, we prepared a hydroxyl-terminated hyperbranched polyester (HBPE-OH) with trimethyloypropane as the core and 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid as an AB(2) monomer. The HBPE-OH was then modified with succinic anhydride to obtain the carboxyl-terminated hyperbranched polyester (HBPE-COOH). The effects of the dosage, Ca2+ concentration, pH value, and temperature of the system on the inhibition efficiency were investigated when HBPE-COOH was used as an inhibitor of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) scale. HBPE-COOH acted as a good antiscaling inhibitor for CaCO3; when the polyester concentration was 200mg/L, the scale inhibition rate exceeded 70%. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition was the disturbance of the growth of the crystals and modification of the crystal morphology by the hyperbranched polyester.

AB Dactylis glomerata L. (orchardgrass) is an important perennial forage species in temperate areas of the world. It is usually used for silage, grazing and hay because of its high nutritional value and reproducibility. Central Asia, Xinjiang and Tibetan Plateau in China possess various special micro-environments that harbor many valuable resources, while different degrees of degradation of the grassland ecosystem occurred due to climatic changing and human activities. Investigating the genetic diversity of wild D. glomerat could provide basis for collection, protection, and utilization of some excellent germplasm resources. Totally 210 individuals from 14 populations D five from Xinjiang, two from Kangding (Tibetan Plateau), and seven from Central Asia were identified using AFLP technology. The average values of Nei's genetic diversity (H-j) and Shannon information index (H-o) were 0.383 and 0.394 respectively. UPGMA tree, STRUCTURE analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed populations from same region clustered together. AMOVA revealed 35.10% of the genetic differentiation (F-st) occurred among populations. Gene flow (N-m) was limited among all populations. Genetic diversity of D. glomerata was high but limited under isolation-by-distance pattern, resulting in high genetic differentiation and low gene flow among populations. Adjacent regions also exhibited similar results because of the barriers of high mountains. The environmental factors, such as precipitation, elevation, latitude and longitude also had some impacts on genetic diversity and structure pattern of populations.

AB Polyurethane with pendant azide groups on the soft segment (PU-GAP) was prepared in this study to further increase the content of reactive azide groups and improve their surfaces enrichment for further functionalization. Polymer diols with pendant azide groups (GAP) were prepared by transforming the pendant chlorine groups at polyepichlorohydrin (PECH) into azide groups with sodium azide. The prepared PECH, GAP and PU-GAP was characterized by GPC, H-1 NMR and FTIR. Propargylic mPEG (mPEG-alkyne) was used as model surface modification reagents which was grafted on the prepared azido containing polyurethane films via click chemistry. The surface morphology, chemical composition and wettabilities were studied by SEM, XPS and water contact angle (WCA) analysis, respectively. SEM results demonstrated different surface topologies between mPEG modified PU surface and original PU surface. XPS and WCA analysis proved the successful grafting of mPEG on the pendant azide groups of PUs. The mPEG modified PU surfaces demonstrated good antifouling activities against model bacteria and mPEG with larger molecular weights modified surfaces showed better resistance efficiency to attachment of bacteria. Therefore, the surface reactive polyurethane we prepared can be a universal platform for further functionalization according actual applications.

AB To improve the therapeutic index of cisplatin (CDDP), we present here a new paradigm of drug-induced self-assembly by harnessing phosphato-platinum cornplexation. Specifically, we show that a phosphato-platinum cross-linked micelle (PpY/Pt) can be generated by using a block copolymer methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)block-poly(L-phosphotyrosine) (mPEG-b-PpY). Coating of PpY/Pt with aR9-iRGD peptide by simple mixing affords a targeting micelle with near neutral-charged surface (iPpY/Pt). The micelles feature in well-controlled sizes below 50 nm and high, stability under physiological conditions, and can withstand various environmental stresses. Importantly, the micelles demonstrate on-demand drug release profiles in response to pathological cues such as high ATP concentration and acidic pH. In vitro, the micelles are efficiently internalized and almost equally potent compared to CDDP. Moreover, iPpY/Pt induce greater cytotoxicity than PpY/Pt in a 3D tumor spheroid model likely due to its deeper tumor penetration. In vivo, the micelles exhibit prolonged circulation half-lives, enhanced tumor accumulation, excellent tumor growth inhibition in a xenograft HeLa model and an orthotropic mammary 4T1 model, and improved safety profiles evidenced by the reduced nephrotoxicity. Together) this work demonstrates for the first time that phosphato-platinurn complexation can be exploited for effective delivery of CDDP, and suggests a paradigm shift of constructing nanosystems for other anticancer metallodrugs.

AB Achievement in school is crucial for students to be able to pursue successful careers and lead happy lives in the future. Although many psychological attributes have been found to be associated with academic performance, the neural substrates of academic performance remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the relationship between brain structure and academic performance in a large sample of high school students via structural magnetic resonance imaging (S-MRI) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach. The whole-brain regression analyses showed that higher academic performance was related to greater regional gray matter density (rGMD) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is considered a neural center at the intersection of cognitive and non-cognitive functions. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggested that general intelligence partially mediated the impact of the left DLPFC density on academic performance. These results persisted even after adjusting for the effect of family socioeconomic status (SES). In short, our findings reveal a potential neuroanatomical marker for academic performance and highlight the role of general intelligence in explaining the relationship between brain structure and academic performance.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effects of chromium from chromium propionate (CrPro) on serum lipids, carcass traits, and breast meat quality in heat-stressed birds. A total of 210 1-day-old male broilers were randomly allotted by initial body weight (BW) into 5 treatments with 7 replicates with 6 birds per replicate pen for 42 days. The treatments included a basal corn-soybean meal diet and basal diet supplemented with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg Cr/kg diet. Birds had ad libitum access to feed and distilled-deionized water at normal conditions for 1-3 weeks with little or no stress, and then birds were housed under heat stress conditions with 35 +/- 2 A degrees C ambient temperature for 4-6 weeks. Results showed that serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.0006) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) (P = 0.0038) concentrations were decreased linearly as Cr dose increased. Compared with other groups, birds receiving 0.8 or 1.6 mg Cr/kg had lower TG (P = 0.0015). Compared to control birds, birds fed diets with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg Cr/kg supplementation had lower LDLC (P = 0.0006). However, the total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) concentrations in serum were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). No difference was observed in BW, the relative weights of breast muscle, thigh muscle and abdominal fat (P > 0.05), and breast meat quality (Ph-15min, Ph-24h,Ph- L-*, a(*), b(*), cooking loss, shear force) among the treatments (P > 0.05). Results from this study indicated that CrPro supplementation could be beneficial to serum lipids metabolism of heat-stressed broiler chickens by decreasing TG and LDLC contents, but had no impacts on meat quality and carcass traits of the heat-stressed broilers.

AB An enterovirus (EV) strain, designated as SWUN-AB001, was isolated in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from a yak with severe diarrheal disease. The complete genome of strain SWUN-AB001 was 7,382 bp in length and shared 35.1-68.5% nt identities with bovine EVs belonging to a candidate new type EV-F7. Using the sequence difference values in the VP1 gene as a criterion for demarcating a new serotype/genotype in the Enterovirus genus, strain SWUN-AB001 had only a 71.1% nt and a 79.2% aa identity, in the VP1 region, with the most closely matched EV, further indicating that a new type of EV had been identified. Phylogenetic analysis of the nt sequence of the viral polyprotein and of VP1 genes demonstrated that the virus fell within the EV-F cluster, but was located in a unique lineage. Furthermore, a large-scale surveillance study indicated that the prevalence of this EV in yaks was 31.05% (95% CI = 25.5-37.6%) in 235 animals with diarrhea and 24.13% (95% CI = 17.4-32.4%) in 116 healthy yaks. However, there was no significant difference in virus prevalence between diarrheal and healthy samples. Interestingly, in the Tibet region, diarrheal feces had a higher incidence of EVs than feces of healthy yaks (odd ratios = 6.03, 95% CI = 1.93-18.86), indicating that the incidence of EV was potentially correlated with the clinical symptom of diarrhea in yaks.

AB In this research, reducible polydopamine coated magnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs@PDA) were prepared and doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated for both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection and cell targeting drug delivery. The SPIONs@PDA exhibited excellent water-solubility and colloidal stability, because the coating of the magnetic nanoparticle was a crosslinked reducible polydopamine synthesized with N, N-bis(acrylate) cystamine (BACy) as a crosslinker, dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) as an anchor to immobilize SPIONs, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to provide colloidal stability. The SPIONs@PDA showed reduction-sensitivity due to the reducible disulfide bond in the polymer network. Subsequently, a sustained and high cumulative drug release in glutathione (GSH) was observed, rather than the low drug release in PBS (pH 7.4). Fluorescent imaging studies by confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that the prepared SPIONs@PDA could specifically target tumor cells. The results of the cytotoxicity assays further demonstrated that the DOX-loaded SPIONs@PDA presented efficient antitumor activity to HeLa cells. These favorable properties suggested SPIONs@PDA as promising targeted magnetic nanoparticles for MRI detection and stimuli-triggered drug delivery in cancer theranostics.

AB It has been well documented that cognitive conflict is sensitive to the relative proportion of congruent and incongruent trials. However, few studies have examined whether affective conflict processing is modulated as a function of proportion congruency (PC). To address this question we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) while subjects performed both cognitive and affective face-word Stroop tasks. By varying the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials in each block, we examined the extent to which PC impacts both cognitive and affective conflict control at different temporal stages. Results showed that in the cognitive task an anteriorly localized early N2 component occurred predominantly in the low proportion congruency context, whereas in the affective task it was found to occur in the high proportion congruency one. The N2 effects across the two tasks were localized to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, where responses were increased in the cognitive task but decreased in the affective one. Furthermore, high proportions of congruent items produced both larger amplitude of a posteriorly localized sustained potential component and a larger behavioral Stroop effect in cognitive and affective tasks. Our findings suggest that cognitive and affective conflicts engage early dissociable attentional control mechanisms and a later common conflict response system.

TI Evaluation of Suitable Internal Control Genes for RT-qPCR in Yak Mammary
   Tissue during the Lactation Cycle
SO PLOS ONE

AB The yak is primarily found throughout the Tibetan high plateau and the surrounding mountainous area of south central Asia; among its others attributes, its milk is very important for the local population. A key concern in the field of yak research is the better understanding of which genes control the production and composition of milk. The most accurate and sensitive method for gene expression analysis is quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). It is essential for reliable RT-qPCR to be able to the normalize the data using internal control genes (ICGs). However, it is critical to assess the reliability of the normalization by testing multiple ICGs. Our objective was to uncover a reliable normalization for RT-qPCR data obtained from yak mammary tissue during the lactation cycle. We assessed the reliability of 10 ICGs (ACTB, EIF6, GAPDH, LRP10, MRPL39, MRPS15, MTG1, RPS8, RPS23, and UXT) using geNorm. The analysis revealed that all of the tested ICGs can be considered to be reliable, but the use of the 6 most stable ICGs should be applied to yield a reliable normalization factor (NF). We compared the results of 3 target genes (CSN1S1, ESR1, and MYC) normalized using 6, 3, or 1 of the best ICGs. We did not observe overall differences between the 3 normalization strategies with the exception of 1 time point in MYC. The use of only a single ICG is not recommended; thus, we concluded that the calculation of the NF using the 3 best ICGs, MRPS15, RPS23, and UXT, is a reliable normalization strategy for RT-qPCR data obtained from yak mammary tissue during pregnancy and lactation. A dilution effect of the ICGs due to a large increase in the mRNA of abundantly expressed genes in bovine and porcine mammary tissue during the lactation cycle was previously observed. To test for the presence of a dilution effect in our study, we evaluated the pattern of non-normalized RT-qPCR data of ICGs from pregnancy to lactation and compared them with the total RNA concentration, milk yield, and non-normalized RT-qPCR data of 3 target genes. With a few exceptions, the non-normalized RT-qPCR data for the tested ICGs was significantly increased by lactation and had a positive correlation with total RNA and the non-normalized RT-qPCR data of CSN1S1. These data clearly indicated the presence of a "concentration effect" of single mRNA that remains unexplained but needs to be accounted for during the normalization of RT-qPCR data. Based on our findings, we recommend that the NF of the MRPS15, RPS23, and UXT genes should be used in the normalization of RT-qPCR data obtained from mammary tissue of lactating yaks during pregnancy and lactation.

AB Ag/ZnO nanoparticle (NP) heterostructures are synthesized through a modified polymer-network gel method in which glucose is added to the precursor solution to prevent the gel from drastically shrinking during drying of the aqueous solution. Structural and optical properties of the samples are characterized by a range of techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-Vis, and PL. The high-quality Ag-ZnO heterostructure is evidenced clearly by high-resolution TEM. The Ag/ZnO heterostructure nanocomposites exhibit a higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of methyl orange than pure ZnO. Especially, Ag/ZnO NP heterostructures with the Ag/Zn molar ratio of 5:95 (sample ZA-5) show the highest degradation efficiency, which is 11 times higher compared with pure ZnO. The photoluminescence properties of the heterostructures and O defect states are studied to well explain the observed photocatalytic effects. ZA-5 also exhibits competitive photocatalytic activity for the degradation of other pollutant dyes such as Methylene blue and Rhodamine B compared with the recently reported techniques, while showing excellent catalyst photostability as well as offering simplicity and reliability.

AB A purified polysaccharide with a galactose backbone (SPR-1, Mw 3,622 Da) was isolated from processed Polygonati Rhizoma with black beans (PRWB) and characterized its chemical properties. The backbone of SPR-1 consisted of [(4)-(3-D-Galp-(1]9 -f 4,6)-(3-D-Galp-(1 -f 4)-a-D-GalpA-(1 -f 4)-a-D-GalpA-(1 -f 4)-aD-Glcp-(1 -f 4,6)-a-D-Glcp-(1 -f 4)-a/(3-D-Glcp, with a branch chain of R1: (3-D-Galp-(1 -f 3)-(3-D-Galp(1-f connected to the -f4,6)-(3-D-Galp-(1-f via O-6, and a branch chain of R2: a-D-Glcp-(1 -f6)-a-D-Glcp(1-f connected to the -f4,6)-a-D-Glcp-(1-f via O-6. Immunomodulatory assays showed that the SPR-1 significantly activated macrophages, and increased secretion of NO and cytokines (i.e., IL-1(3 and TNF-a), as well as promoted the phagocytic activities of cells. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis and molecular docking results indicated high-affinity binding between SPR-1 and MD2 with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 18.8 mM. It was suggested that SPR-1 activated the immune response through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and downstream responses. Our research demonstrated that the SPR-1 has a promising candidate from PRWB for the TLR4 agonist to induce immune response, and also provided an easily accessible way that can be used for PR deep processing.

AB While the growth of digital infrastructure theoretically offers increased opportunities for enterprises, the policy implications may vary depending on the firm size. We utilize the pilot policy of the Broadband China Strategy as an exogenous shock for firms and adopt a unique dataset from the National Tax Survey to investigate the impact of digital infrastructure expansion on the carbon intensity of small enterprises. The results indicate that digital infrastructure expansion leads to a notable increase of 9.04% in small firm's carbon intensity. These results exhibit resilience, withstanding rigorous testing through various robustness checks. This increase is primarily attributed to two channels: the competition effect, which results in a decline in small firm's output, and the change in energy structure, which leads to an increase in small firm's carbon emissions. Heterogeneity analysis reveals a more pronounced increase for small enterprises located in regions with less stringent environmental regulations and in industries with higher degree of market concentration. Our conclusion suggests that the government should pay attention to the survival and development of small enterprises. This entails ensuring fair market competition on digital platforms and preventing the dominant enterprises from abusing their information advantages to jeopardize the interests of small enterprises.

AB Profit-driven artificial intelligence (AI) systems and profit-based performance measures are widely used in credit scoring. When assessing the performance of an AI system for credit scoring, previous research typically assumes that the cost and benefit parameters and their distributional information are available. In reality, however, these parameters and their distributions are often not precisely known. This study considers parameter uncertainty in the development of credit-scoring models and the estimation of profits and risks generated by those models. We propose a novel profit-based metric-the worst-case expected minimum cost (WEMC)-to estimate the profit of credit-scoring models with uncertain parameters. Furthermore, we introduce the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (WCVaR) metric to measure the loss incurred from employing a classification model in credit scoring under the deterioration of cost parameters. A multiobjective feature -selection framework based on WEMC (or minimum cost) and WCVaR is then presented for model development. Using a comprehensive bankruptcy database, we compare the proposed methods with wrapper methods that use traditional metrics as selection criteria, as well as filter and embedding methods. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the economic benefits of the proposed methods under different scenarios that simulate dynamic changes in macroeconomic conditions. The results suggest that the proposed methods outperform other feature-selection methods in the aspects of profit and risk performance metrics in most cases.

AB Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, it is assumed that the chirality of nanocarriers is also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, l/d-tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (l/d-CMSNs) are fabricated via a one-pot cocondensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers will be benefited from their chirality. It is found that l-CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio-adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the d-chiral (d-CMSN), racemic (dl-CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. The multiple chiral recognition mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically demonstrated following simple differential adsorption on biointerfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction is the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, l-CMSN, which is proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible, and biodegradable, is efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72-2.05-fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helps the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32-27.03-times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger antitumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

AB In distribution networks, high-impedance faults (HIFs) occur frequently and have a harmful impact on the distribution network. However, fault detection and fault phase selection of HIFs are challenging due to weak fault characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved HIF identification scheme based on a kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) that can sensitively identify HIFs and select the fault phase by adaptively extracting the weak fault characteristics. First, a fault feature extraction strategy based on discrete wavelet decomposition (DWT) and the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is proposed to obtain multiple features that describe the weak fault characteristics of HIFs. Second, an XGBoost-based fault feature selection scheme is proposed for screening with sensitive characterization of HIFs. Next, a sensitive and accurate HIF identification scheme based on the improved learning algorithm (KELM) is proposed to enable accurate and sensitive HIF detection and phase selection. Finally, numerical simulations based on PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB were carried out, which reveals the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed HIF identification scheme. Compared with the traditional HIF identification scheme, the proposed method exhibits conciseness and correctness.

AB Ammonia poses a significant challenge in the contemporary intensive breeding industry, resulting in substantial economic losses. Despite this, there is a dearth of research investigating efficacious strategies to prevent ammonia poisoning in poultry. Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate the molecu-lar mechanisms through which Luteolin (Lut) safe-guards mitochondria and restores equilibrium to energy metabolism disorders, thereby shielding chicken spleen lymphocytes from the detrimental effects of ammonia poisoning. Chicken spleen lymphocytes were categorized into 3 distinct groups: the control group, the ammonia group (with the addition of 1 mmol/L of ammonium chloride), and the Lut group (with the treatment of 0.5 mg/mL of Lut for 12 h followed by the addition of 1 mmol/L of ammonium chloride). These groups were then cultured for a duration of 24 h. To investigate the potential protective effect of Lut on lymphocytes exposed to ammonia, various techniques were employed, including CCK-8 analysis, ultrastructural observation, reagent kit methodology, fluorescence microscopy, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The findings indicate that Lut has the potential to mitigate the mor-phological damage of mitochondria caused by ammonia poisoning. Additionally, it can counteract the decline in mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, and ATPase activities (specifically Na+/K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, and Ca/Mg2+-ATPase) following exposure to ammonia in lymphocytes. Lut also has the ability to regulate the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion (Opa1, Mfn1, and Mfn2) and division (Drp1 and Mff) in spleen lympho-cytes after ammonia exposure. This regulation leads to a balanced energy metabolism (HK1, HK2, LDHA, LDHB, PFK, PK, SDHB, and ACO2) and provides pro-tection against ammonia poisoning.

AB The development of regenerative medicine provides new options for the treatment of end-stage liver diseases. Stem cells, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are effective tools for tissue repair in regenerative medicine. iPSCs are an appropriate source of hepatocytes for the treatment of liver disease due to their unlimited multiplication capacity, their coverage of the entire range of genetics required to simulate human disease, and their evasion of ethical implications. iPSCs have the ability to gradually produce hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) with homologous phenotypes and physiological functions. However, how to induce iPSCs to differentiate into HLCs efficiently and accurately is still a hot topic. This review describes the existing approaches for inducing the differentiation of iPSCs into HLCs, as well as some challenges faced, and summarizes various parameters for determining the quality and functionality of HLCs. Furthermore, the application of iPSCs for in vitro hepatoprotective drug screening and modeling of liver disease is discussed. In conclusion, iPSCs will be a dependable source of cells for stem-cell therapy to treat end-stage liver disease and are anticipated to facilitate individualized treatment for liver disease in the future.

AB Accurate vehicle position is crucial to vehicular Ad-Hoc network (VANET) applications. The wildly used global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have limited localization accuracy, especially when GNSS signals are blocked or contaminated with reflected signals. Cooperative localization based on multi-vehicle information fusion will be the core component in VANET in the near future. This paper strives to enhance the localization accuracy using the fusion of GNSS and relative range information in static scenes. The formulation following the Maximum-Likelihood strategy is a quadratic non-convex programming, which is NP-hard. An iterative localization algorithm is proposed, where an approximate quadratic programming with linear constraints is solved in each iteration. Additional inspection steps and correction step are designed to ensure the convergence and feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis shows that the limit of the proposed algorithm must be a global optimal solution of the formulated problem and the mean squared error can reach the Cramer-Rao lower bound. In terms of localization accuracy, the proposed method outperforms the existing linearized weighted least-squares method and semidefinite relaxation method, while exhibiting moderate computational complexity.

AB A better understanding the mechanisms driving plant biomass allocation in different ecosystems is an important theoretical basis for illustrating the adaptive strategies of plants. To date, the effects of habitat conditions on plant biomass allocation have been widely studied. However, it is less known how plant community traits and functions (PCTF) affect biomass allocation, particularly in alpine grassland ecosystems. In this study, community-weighted means (CWM) were calculated at the community level using five leaf functional traits, and the relationships between PCTF and biomass trade-offs were explored using correlation analysis, variation partitioning analysis and structural equation modeling. We found that the trade-off values were greater than zero in both alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS) across the Tibetan Plateau, with different values of 0.203 and 0.088 for AM and AS, respectively. Moreover, the critical factors determining biomass allocation in AS were species richness (SR; scored at 0.69) and leaf dry matter content of CWM (CWMLDMC, scored at 0.42), while in AM, the key factors were leaf dry matter content (CWMLDMC, scored at 0.48) and leaf carbon content of CWM (CWMLC, scored at -0.45). In particular, both CWMLDMC and SR in AS, as well as CWMLDMC and CWMLC in AM were primarily regulated by precipitation. In summary, precipitation tends to drive biomass allocation in alpine grasslands through its effects on PCTF, hence highlighting the importance of PCTF in regulating plant biomass allocation strategies along precipitation gradients.

AB To ensure confidentiality, medical information is usually encrypted before it is sent to a third party for processing. Encryption technology can protect the privacy of data, but it limits the ability to search for data. The problem is usually solved by using public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS). Recently, some certificateless PEKS (CPEKS) schemes have been proposed. Not only do they allow users to search encrypted data, but they do not have the problems of certificate management and key escrow. However, they rely on the high-consumption bilinear pairing, and some of them are vulnerable to Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA). To address these issues, we design a lightweight CPEKS scheme for the Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) that does not include bilinear pairing. In the random oracle model, our scheme is proved to be secure. The analysis results show that the proposed scheme has better overall performance than the existing schemes according to the security property, computation cost, and communication cost. Finally, an IoMT application scenario of our scheme is given.

AB Developing a neuromorphic system beyond conventional von Neumann's architecture is necessary for future artificial intelligence applications and data-intensive computation. Optoelectronic synapses, like biological synapses, are extremely comparable in structure and operating mechanism and can learn directly from the light stimulus, making them a suitable technology for brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Here, by constructing a core-shell structure of CuAlO2@ZnO oxide heterojunction, we have successfully fabricated the optoelectronic synaptic devices structured as ITO/CuAlO2@ZnO/ITO-glass that can be effectively motivated by light signal at visual light range. Moreover, there is an ultra-high gain of photocurrent generated in the device, resulting in an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) of mu A level even at a lower light intensity. In addition, the device could mimic multiple synaptic plasticities at the micro-level such as EPSC, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), short-term plasticity (STP), spike-number-dependent plasticity (SNDP), and "advanced behaviors" of human-like innate learning and memory functions. The results presented here may serve as a new benchmark for the use of optoelectronic synaptic devices in artificial intelligence.

The results showed the overexpressed immu-noglobulin E (IgE), unbalanced Th1-/Th2-type immune cytokines and inflammatory factors in beta Lg-allergic mice were significantly attenuated by oral administration of HFOPs, resulting in the prevention of inflammatory le-sions in spleen and colonic histopathology. Moreover, HFOPs increased ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes at phylum level in sensitive mice, and improved the abundance of Lactobacillaceae at family level to maintain oral tolerance against beta Lg and prevented allergic response. The use of HFOPs may provide a potential alternative for preventing the milk allergy induced by WPI.

AB The SIRT1 epigenetic regulator is involved in hepatic lipid homoeostasis. However, the role of SIRT1 in regulating intramuscular fat deposition as well as the pathways and potential epigenetic targets involved remain unknown. Herein, we investigate SIRT1 function, its genome-wide epigenetic target profile, and transcriptomic changes under SIRT1 overexpression during yak intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation. To this end, we analysed the relationship between SIRT1 and intramuscular fat content as well as lipid metabolism-related genes in longissimus dorsi tissue. We found that SIRT1 expression negatively correlates with intramuscular fat content as well as with the expression of genes related to lipid synthesis, while positively correlating with that of fatty acid oxidation-involved genes. SIRT1 overexpression in intramuscular preadipocytes significantly reduced adipose differentiation marker expression, intracellular triacylglycerol content, and lipid deposition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing of H3K4ac (a known direct target of SIRT1) and high-throughput mRNA sequencing results revealed that SIRT1 may regulate intramuscular fat deposition via three potential new transcription factors (NRF1, NKX3.1, and EGR1) and four genes (MAPK1, RXRA, AGPAT1, and HADH) implicated in protein processing within the endoplasmic reticulum pathway and the MAPK signalling pathway in yaks. Our study provides novel insights into the role of SIRT1 in regulating yak intramuscular fat deposition and may help clarify the mechanistic determinants of yak meat characteristics.

AB Ketosis is one of the most important health problems in dairy sheep. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic alterations in hyperketonemic (HYK) ewes. Forty-six adult Sardinian ewes were enrolled between 7 +/- 3 days post-partum. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein using Venosafe tubes containing clot activator from jugular vein after clinical examination. The concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) was determined in serum and used to divide ewes into assign ewes into: Non-HYK (serum BHB < 0.80 mmol/L) and HYK (serum BHB >= 0.80 mmol/L) groups. Animal data and biochemical parameters of groups were examined with one-way ANOVA, and metabolite differences were tested using a t-test. A robust principal component analysis model and a heatmap were used to highlight common trends among metabolites. Over-representation analysis was performed to investigate metabolic pathways potentially altered in connection with BHB alterations. The metabolomic analysis identified 54 metabolites with 14 different between groups. These metabolites indicate altered ruminal microbial populations and fermentations; an interruption of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; initial lack of glucogenic substrates; mobilization of body reserves; the potential alteration of electron transport chain; influence on urea synthesis; alteration of nervous system, inflammatory response, and immune cell function.

LA English
DT Article
AB The flipped classroom is a revolutionary teaching method that reverses the traditional roles of teachers and students, as well as the traditional classroom and after-school schedules. The flipped classroom is currently the most popular English teaching reform, so the design and development must meet the practical needs of college physical education teaching. Subverting the classroom is a highly effective service for college physical education that promotes college physical education quality improvement. The research topic of this study is the application of the flipped classroom teaching model based on few-shot learning in public physical education in ordinary colleges and universities. It analyzes the conceptual advantages of the flipped classroom teaching model based on few-shot learning, combining its benefits with the current common college environment. There are issues in physical education, and a teaching model suitable for public physical education in ordinary colleges and universities is gradually being developed in order to improve students' enthusiasm for independent learning and classroom teaching quality. The flipped classroom teaching model has given rise to new ideas for the construction of a physical education model: first, students' physical learning is no longer limited to the physical education classroom, thanks to the use of network technology to change the learning environment. Teaching resources have been expanded to include many online sports resources, so students' physical learning is no longer limited to the physical education classroom. Students can learn anytime and anywhere, which allows them to continue their education throughout their lives; second, flipped classrooms increase teacher-student interaction and play an important role in reestablishing a harmonious teacher-student teaching relationship: third, online courses help students develop their skills. Autonomous learning's ability to shape students' personalized learning is better suited to the development of students' core literacy.

AB Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA), a noncoding RNA over 200nt in length, can regulate glycolysis through metabolic pathways, glucose metabolizing enzymes, and epigenetic reprogramming. Upon viral infection, increased aerobic glycolysis providzes material and energy for viral replication. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) is the only protein-specified downstream of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) that bridges the gap between antiviral immunity and glycolysis. MAVS binding to RIG-I inhibits MAVS binding to Hexokinase (HK2), thereby impairing glycolysis, while excess lactate production inhibits MAVS and the downstream antiviral immune response, facilitating viral replication. LncRNAs can also regulate antiviral innate immunity by interacting with RIG-I and downstream signaling pathways and by regulating the expression of interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Altogether, we summarize the relationship between glycolysis, antiviral immunity, and lncRNAs and propose that lncRNAs interact with glycolysis and antiviral pathways, providing a new perspective for the future treatment against virus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.

AB Personal big data can greatly promote social management, business applications, and personal services, and bring certain economic benefits to users. The difficulty with personal big data security and privacy protection lies in realizing the maximization of the value of personal big data and in striking a balance between data privacy protection and sharing on the premise of satisfying personal big data security and privacy protection. Thus, in this paper, we propose a personal big data p ricing m ethod based on d ifferential p rivacy (PMDP). We design two different mechanisms of positive and reverse pricing to reasonbly price personal big data. We perform aggregate statistics on an open dataset and extensively evaluated its performance. The experimental results show that PMDP can provide reasonable pricing for personal big data and fair compensation to data owners, ensuring an arbitrage-free condition and finding a balance between privacy protection and data utility.

AB Job insecurity is considered an important antecedent of an employee's creativity. Though, the relationship between job insecurity and proactive behavior has been neglected in previous human resources management studies. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of job insecurity on employees' proactive behavior and its mechanism. Based on the social cognitive theory and cognitive appraisal theory, two types of cognitive appraisal of employee's job insecurity (hindrance vs. challenge) as mediator variables of job insecurity and proactive behavior association. In addition, the moderator roles of self-efficacy are examined. This study is carried out with 257 employees from Chinese firms to examine the hypothesized moderated mediation model by using the hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap. The results showed a different effect of job insecurity depending on its conceptualization. The results show that job insecurity has a negative effect on employees' proactive behavior. At the same time, cognitive appraisal of employees' job insecurity mediated the association between job insecurity and employee's proactive behavior. Self-efficacy not only moderates the relationship between job insecurity and cognitive appraisal but also moderate the cognitive appraisal's mediation effect between job insecurity and proactive behavior. The study's theoretical and practical contributions and future research are discussed.

AB BackgroundIntramuscular adipocytes differentiation is a complex process, which is regulated by various transcription factor, protein factor regulators and signal transduction pathways. However, the proteins and signal pathways that regulates goat intramuscular adipocytes differentiation remains unclear.ResultIn this study, based on nanoscale liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS), the tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling analysis was used to investigate the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) related with the differentiation process of goat intramuscular adipocytes. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed for the characterization of the identified DAPs. The candidate proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring analysis. As a result, a total of 123 proteins, 70 upregulation proteins and 53 downregulation proteins, were identified as DAPs which may be related with the differentiation process of goat intramuscular adipocytes. Furthermore, the cholesterol metabolism pathway, glucagon signaling pathway and glycolysis / gluconeogenesis pathway were noticed that may be the important signal pathways for goat Intramuscular adipocytes differentiation.ConclusionsBy proteomic comparison between goat intramuscular preadipocytes (P_IMA) and intramuscular adipocytes (IMA), we identified a series protein that might play important role in the goat intramuscular fat differentiation, such as SRSF10, CSRP3, APOH, PPP3R1, CRTC2, FOS, SERPINE1 and AIF1L, could serve as candidates for further elucidate the molecular mechanism of IMF differentiation in goats.

AB Plant pathogens and their hosts often coexist with mammal grazers. However, the direction and strength of grazing effects on foliar fungal diseases can be idiosyncratic, varying among host plant species and pathogen types.
   We combined a 6 yr yak-grazing experiment, a clipping experiment simulating different mammal consumption patterns (leaf damage vs whole-leaf removal), and a meta-analysis of 63 comparisons to evaluate how grazing impacts foliar fungal diseases across plant growth types (grass vs forb) and pathogen life histories (biotroph vs necrotroph).
   In the yak-grazing experiment, grazing had no significant effect on disease severity, and grasses experienced a higher disease severity than forbs; there was a significant interaction between pathogen type and grazing. In both the yak-grazing experiment and meta-analysis, grazing decreased biotrophic pathogens (mainly rusts and powdery mildew), but did not affect necrotrophic pathogens (mainly leaf spots). The clipping experiment suggested that grazers might promote infection by necrotrophic pathogens by producing wounds on leaves, but inhibit biotrophic pathogens via leaf removal.
   In conclusion, our three-part approach revealed that intrinsic properties of both plants and pathogens shape patterns of disease in natural ecosystems, greatly improving our ability to predict disease severity under mammal grazing.

AB Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which are involved in dynamic regulation of cell cycle, play an indispensable role in controlling the tumor growth. Here, based on the scaffold of palbociclib, we designed and synthesized a series of covalent CDK4/6 inhibitors that targeted amino acid Thr107. The optimized compound C-13 exhibited potent in vitro anticancer activity against CDK4/6 with high selectivity over CDK4/6. Moreover, C-13 showed significant tumor growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft model (TGI of 93.49% at dose of 40 mg/kg) without causing significant weight loss and toxicity during the treatment period.

AB Wheat gluten hydrolysates (WGH) and KCl were used to examine their effects on fermentation performances and physiological characteristics of brewer's yeast during very high gravity (VHG) fermentation. Results showed that all supplementations exhibited a notable promotion in yeast growth, glucose utilization, ethanol production, and physiological characteristics. Combination supplementation of 0.3% WGH and 0.5% KCl showed the best promotion effect with 6.38%, 9.41% and 8.68% of increases in biomass, glucose utilization and ethanol production, respectively. Moreover, combination addition of WGH and KCl also enhanced significantly membrane integrity and mitochondrial functionality of brewer's yeast. Amino acid compositions of WGH and intracellular metabolites analysis indicated that active nitrogen metabolism and high levels of stress resistant substances might be responsible for the improvement of growth and fermentation performances in brewer's yeast by nutrient supplementation.

The structure of fluorescent probe PT was characterized by spectral data and elemental analysis. The probe showed weak fluorescence without Hg2+ ion, and the color of the solution was colorless. Upon the addition of Hg2+ ion, the probe reacted specifically with Hg2+ to produce a strong fluorescence, and the color of solution turn to yellow, which can be directly inspect with the naked eye. The limit of detection of the probe PT for Hg2+ could reach 0.974 nM. Furthermore, the probe PT can work in a wide pH range and successfully applied in detection of Hg2+ in real water samples.

AB Addressed in this paper is the issue of how to promote cooperation among selfish individuals by changing the number of interactive neighbors in the evolutionary snowdrift game on a square lattice. Quite a few mechanisms that promoted cooperation in evolutionary games have been reported. It was usually assumed in past literature that each player had fixed neighbors to interact. However, such an assumption is inconsistent with most actual situations in society since the neighbors of each individual are not fixed in real life. Therefore, this paper takes into account a relatively realistic situation where each player has own potential neighbors and, in each round, has interactive neighbors randomly selected from potential neighbors. That is, for each player, its interactive neighbors in any round may be different from those in the next round. So interactive neighbors of each individual are unfixed. The results of Monte Carlo simulations reveal that compared with traditional fixed-neighbor-mechanism (FNM), the unfixed-neighbor-mechanism (UFNM) can lead to a higher level of cooperation in a larger range for both of the Fermi update and proportional update. In general, due to introducing the UFNM in snowdrift game, the number of interactive neighbors may be less than fixed neighbors in whole evolutionary process and thus the game cost is reduced. Therefore this modified mechanism has potential role in social management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis and diarrhoea in kittens worldwide. In this study, a total of 173 feline diarrhoea) faecal and ascetic samples were collected from 15 catteries and six veterinary hospitals in southwest China from 2017 to 2020. FCoV was detected in 80.35% (139/173) of the samples using the RT-nPCR method; these included infections with 122 type I FCoV and 57 type II FCoV. Interestingly, 51 cases had co-infection with types I and II, the first such report in mainland China. To further analyse the genetic diversity of FCoV, we amplified 23 full-length spike (S) genes, including 18 type I and five type II FCoV. The type I FCoV and type II FCoV strains shared 85.5-98.7% and 97.4-98.9% nucleotide (nt) sequence identities between one another, respectively. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of 23 FCoV strains showed a high degree of variation (73.6-80.3%). There was six type I FCoV strains with two amino acid insertions (159HL160) in the NTD. In addition, 18 strains of type I FCoV belonged to the le cluster, and five strains of type II FCoV were in the IIb cluster based on phylogenetic analysis. Notably, it was first time that two type I FCoV strains had recombination in the NTD, and the recombination regions was located 140-857 nt of the S gene. This study constitutes a systematic investigation of the current infection status and molecular characteristics of FCoV in southwest China.

AB Three Cu(I) complexes, [Cu(dPPb)(bbim)]BF4 (1), [Cu(DPEphos)(bbim)]BF4 (2) and [Cu (Xantphos)(bbim)]BF4 (3) (dppb =1, 2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene, DPEphos=bis(2-diphenyl phosphinophenyl)ether, Xantphos=9, 9-dimethyl-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthenes, bbim = bisbenzimidazole), have been synthesized and characterized by IR, H-1 NMR, P-31 NMR, TG, XRD elemental analysis and X-ray crystal structure analysis. The structural analysis indicates that the increases in the temperature from 100 K to 300 K result in the change of bond lengths, bond angles and the weak interactions. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the HOMO -> LUMO energy gap and Miilliken atomic charges are increased or shorten by increasing temperature from 100 K to 300 K, in according with the change of bond lengths and angles, while the composition of HOMO and LUMO orbitals are nearly unchanged at different temperatures. Meanwhile, the solid-state luminescent properties of these copper(I) complexes at 100 K, 200 K and 300 K also exhibit that the change of temperature leads to the variation of the Kr, Knr, tau, Phi(em) and lambda(max), having a certain degree of consistency with the related calculation results. In these complexes, the maximum phosphorescent lifetime and quantum yield are up to 309 mu s and 23% at 300 K, respectively. Moreover, to estimate potential application of copper(I) complexes for LED, monochromatic and white LED have been fabricated, respectively, showing reasonable electroluminescence with the maximum external quantum efficiency 3.95% and 5.31%.

AB Milk fatty acids secreted by the mammary gland are one of the most important determinants of the nutritional value of goat milk. Unlike cow milk, limited data are available on the transcriptome-wide changes across stages of lactation in dairy goats. In this study, goat mammary gland tissue collected at peak lactation, cessation of milking, and involution were analyzed with digital gene expression (DGE) sequencing to generate longitudinal transcript profiles. A total of 51,299 unigenes were identified and further annotated to 12,763 genes, of which 9,131 were differentially expressed across various stages of lactation. Most abundant genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were functionally classified through clusters of euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. A total of 16 possible expression patterns were uncovered, and 13 genes were deemed novel candidates for regulation of lactation in the goat:POLG,SPTA1,KLC,GIT2,COPS3,PDP,CD31,USP16/29/37,TLL1,NCAPH,ABI2,DNAJC4, andMAPK8IP3. In addition,PLA2,CPT1,PLD,GGA,SRPRB, andAP4S1are proposed as novel and promising candidates regulating mammary fatty acid metabolism. "Butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis" and "Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism" were the most impacted pathways, and revealed novel metabolic alterations in lipid metabolism as lactation progressed. Overall, the present study provides new insights into the synthesis and metabolism of fatty acids and lipid species in the mammary gland along with more detailed information on molecular regulation of lactogenesis. The major findings will benefit efforts to further improve milk quality in dairy goats.

AB A stereoselective annulation protocol was developed to construct dihydrofuranoindoles from readily available starting materials. In the presence of a bifunctional squaramide, the Friedel-Crafts alkylation/annulation cascade process occurred smoothly to provide dihydrofuranoindoles in 26-95% isolated yields exclusively as trans-diastereomers (38-99% ee). This catalytic protocol was compatible with a range of structurally distinct hydroxyindoles bearing the hydroxyl group at different positions, providing four kinds of dihydrofuranoindoles. Moreover, gram-scale synthesis and further synthetic manipulation of the product were also demonstrated.

AB DEC-205 receptor-mediated dendritic cells (DC) targeting nanoliposomes is a promising delivery system in eliciting an immune response against pathogens. When this delivery system carries both antigen and immunomodulator, it can effectively regulate the DC function as well as the initial T cell response. To maximize the desired therapeutic effects of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. polysaccharides (EUPS), and induce an efficient humoral and cellular immune response against an antigen, we encapsulated the OVA and EUPS in long-circling nanoliposomes and conjugated it with anti-DEC-205 receptor antibody to obtain a DEC-205-targeted nanoliposomes (anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM). The physicochemical properties and immune-modulating effects were investigated in vitro and in vivo by a series of the experiment to evaluate the targeting efficiency of anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM. In vitro, anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM (160 mu g mL(-1)) could enhance DCs proliferation and increase their phagocytic efficiency. In vivo anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM remarkably promoted the OVA-specific IgG and IgG isotypes levels, enhanced the splenocyte proliferation, and induced the NK cell and CTL cytotoxicity. Besides, the anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM enhanced the maturation of DCs. These findings suggest that the DEC-205 receptor antibody-conjugated EUPS nanoliposome can act as an efficient antigen delivery system to enhance the cellular and humoral immune response by promoting DC maturation. This indicates that the anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM has significant potential as an immune-enhancing agent and antigen delivery system.

AB Spiroplasma eriocheiris, a novel pathogen of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis tremor disease, has led into catastrophic economic losses in aquaculture. S. eriocheiris invaded the hemocytes in the early stage, then invaded nerve tissue and caused typically paroxysmal tremors of pereiopod in the late stage of infection. The purpose of this study was to detect the infection mechanism of hemocytes in the early stage and thoracic ganglion in the late stage of S. eriocheiris infection at the protein level. Hemocytes and thoracic ganglion were collected at 24 h and 10 d after injection (the crabs with typical paroxysmal tremors of the pereiopod), respectively. TMT was performed with isobaric markers, followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In hemocytes, 127 proteins were up-regulated and 85 proteins were down-regulated in 2747 quantified proteins. Many proteins and process including proPO system proteins, hemolymph coagulation system proteins and lectins were differently expressed in hemocytes and involved in the early immune process of E. sinensis against S. eriocheiris infection. Meanwhile, 545 significantly different expression proteins (292 down-regulated and 253 up regulated protein including a number of immune-associated, nervous system development and signal transmission related proteins) were identified in thoracic ganglion in the late stage of S. eriocheiris infection. The qRT-PCR analysis results shown that the selected significantly changed proteins in hemocytes and thoracic ganglion were consistent with the TMT proteomics. This paper reported for the first time to study the responses of crab hemocyte and thoracic ganglion against the S. eriocheiris infection at different stages. These findings help us understand the infection mechanism of S. eriocheiris at different stage with the different tissue.

AB Aim Following the near-complete destruction of China's forest ecosystems during the 20th century, recent reforestation programmes have created large-scale mosaics of protected secondary and plantation forests. These restored forests are often assumed to have limited biodiversity conservation value, but large-scale evaluations of their diversity are lacking. In our study, we compared alpha-diversity and species dissimilarity patterns of vascular plants and ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in restored secondary and plantation forests to remnant mature forests across north-eastern temperate China. We also assessed functional traits of beetles and cross-taxon diversity links to evaluate differences in ecosystem functioning among forest types. Location . Northeast China. Methods Vascular plant and ground beetle assemblages were recorded in 159 temperate forest plots. The alpha-diversity and species compositional dissimilarity of these taxa and the functional traits of beetles were compared between plantation, secondary and mature forest ecosystems. Results Herbaceous plant species richness peaked in mature forests, while carabid and woody plant diversity did not differ between forest types. Species dissimilarity of carabids was lowest in mature forests and highest in plantation forests. Mature forest contained the highest proportion of carnivorous beetles and secondary forests of large-bodied carabids. Carabid diversity and woody plant species richness were positively correlated in mature forests, but not in secondary or plantation forests. Main conclusions While China's mature forests show a great conservation value in harbouring highly diverse herbaceous plant assemblages and an abundance of distinct invertebrate trait groups such as small predatory carabids, China's restored temperate forests also support a high diversity of woody plants and carabids. Overall, our findings offer an encouraging conservation message for biodiversity conservation in China and demonstrate the importance of policy measures that ensure effective long-term protection of both, China's remnant mature forests, but also its new forest ecosystems.

AB In conservation biology, umbrella species are often used as agents for a broader set of species, or as representatives of an ecosystem, and their conservation is expected to benefit a large number of naturally co-occurring species. Southwest China is home to not only global biodiversity hotspots, but also rapid economic and population growth and extensive changes in land use. However, because of the large regional span, the diverse species distributions, and the difficulty of field investigations, traditional methods used to assess umbrella species are not suitable for implementation in Southwest China. In the current study, we assessed 810 key protected species from seven taxa by indicator value analysis, correlation analysis, and factor analysis. We selected 32 species as umbrella species, whose habitats overlapped the habitats of 97% of the total species. Furthermore, the selected species were significantly correlated with 70% of all species in the study area. A total of 16 out of 19 selected animal species have been previously mentioned as umbrella species, compared with only 3 out of 13 plants species; this is despite plants accounting for a large proportion of the total species in Southwest China. We discuss the roles of indicator species and co-occurring species, and provide suggestions for species protection in Southwest China based on the current results. Our research provides valuable scientific information for research on umbrella conservation species over large geographical scales, and related fields of biodiversity conservation.

AB Commonly used separation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, chromatography, and membrane separation, have inherent drawbacks that limit their usage. Herein, we introduced a new separation method, density-changing centrifugation (DCC), which is based on trisodium citrate (TC) and ultracentrifugation. Paclitaxel-loaded cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs/PTX) and doxorubicin-loaded PEGylated liposomes (Lipo/Dox) were prepared as model drug delivery particulates. After optimizing TC concentration and centrifugal conditions, DCC showed superior separation efficiency and accuracy over common ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration methods and displayed comparable or even better separation efficiency compared with size-exclusion chromatography, as demonstrated by the determination of encapsulation efficiency, Tyndall effect, transmittance, and drug recovery. DCC was also proven to minimally impact the size distribution, surface morphology, and thermal properties of the nanoparticles and liposomes, and moreover, it did not affect the determination of drug concentrations. Together, DCC has been demonstrated as a neat and effective method for the separation of free drugs from drug-loaded SLNs and liposomes, which shall be of great benefit for the development of particulate based delivery systems.

AB Feed efficiency (FE) can be affected by dietary composition, management, and metabolic conditions. The liver is the central metabolic organ in cattle; however, specific metabolic changes in the liver under different dietary forage levels have not been clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels (80% or 20% forage, namely S80 and S20) on FE in dairy heifers using integrative metabolomic and proteomic methods. Feed efficiency was lower in the S80 group than the S20 group. A total of 29 metabolites and 60 proteins were significantly different between the liver samples of the two groups. Fourteen selected proteins were analyzed using parallel reaction monitoring to confirm the reliability of proteomic analysis. Integrative functional analysis of differentially expressed metabolites/proteins confirmed the enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense in the S80 heifers. These metabolic pathways are associated with FE in ruminants. Thus, our results suggested that the aforementioned metabolic pathways may be responsible for the reduced FE in heifers fed high levels of forage.
   Biological significance: Improving the efficiency of animal production is a continuously urgent mission of all agricultural producers. Limit-feeding high concentrate diets to heifers is considered as an effective way to improve feed efficiency in heifers' raising, which can not only decrease the feeding and management cost but also relieve some environmental problems. However, the detailed metabolic and physiological changes and mechanisms associated with this strategy remain to be further characterized even some transcriptomics and microbiology work have been done. For extending the knowledge towards this strategy, an integrative metabolomic and proteomic method was used to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels on feed efficiency in dairy heifers. Enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense were found in high forage consumed heifers, which were all related to energy utilization in ruminants and might be responsible for the reduced feed efficiency. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the hepatic metabolism in high or low forage fed heifers may help to design alternative feeding or management strategies that improve feed efficiency.

AB Selective and sensitive detection of G-quadruplex DNA structures is an important issue and attracts extensive interest. To this end, numerous small molecular fluorescent probes have been designed. Here, we present a series of N-alkylated styrylquinolinium dyes named Ls-1, Ls-2 and Ls-3 with varying side groups at the chain end. We found that these dyes exhibited different binding behaviors to DNAs, and Ls-2 with a sulfonato group at the chain end displayed sensitivity and selectivity to G-quadruplex DNA structures in vitro. The characteristics of this dye and its interaction with G-quadruplex DNA were comprehensively investigated by means of UV-vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence, circular dichroism and molecular docking. Furthermore, confocal fluorescence images and MTT assays indicated dye Ls-2 could pass through membrane and enter the living HepG2 cells with low cytotoxicity.

AB 1. FGF1 and FGF10, two paracrine members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family, play critical roles in the development, structural and metabolic remodelling of adipose tissue. 2. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of FGF1 and FGF10 genes in breast muscle and thigh muscle in 5 developmental stages (1, 81, 119, 154 and 210 d old) in Tibetan chickens. The possible relationships between expression of these genes and intramuscular fat (IMF) content were analysed in Tibetan chickens. 3. Expression profiles showed that FGF1 and FGF10 mRNA were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues of 154-d-old Tibetan chickens. Lung tissue contained the highest amount of FGF1 and FGF10 mRNA while breast muscle and thigh muscle exhibited lower levels of FGF1 and FGF10 mRNA in both males and females compared with other tissues (P < 0.05). Temporal expression of FGF1 and FGF10 in breast and thigh muscle showed similar tendencies in males and females, respectively, with peaks in thigh muscle at 119-d-old and breast muscle in 1-d-old males and females, respectively. 4. Correlation analysis suggested that gender had an influence on the relationships of FGF1 and FGF10 expression with IMF content in thigh muscle. The RNA levels of FGF1 and FGF10 genes in male thigh muscle were positively related to IMF content of Tibetan chickens (P < 0.01), while the correlations were shown to be negative in female thigh muscle (P > 0.05). 5. These results provide a basis for functional elucidation of FGF1 and FGF10 genes on adipocyte development and intramuscular fat deposition, as well as selective breeding and resource exploration of local poultry breeds.

AB The previous research on personality and problematic Internet use (PIU) has predominantly, if not exclusively, focused on their direct associations with cross-sectional designs. Based on four annual waves of data from 2,516 Chinese college students, this study examined the mediating role of maladaptive cognitions over Internet use in the associations between personality traits (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism) and PIU. Results indicated that these personality traits assessed at year 2 (i.e., the second college year) were indirectly associated with PIU at year 4 via maladaptive cognitions over Internet use at year 3. The indirect associations were robust after controlling for PIU at year 2, depression and anxiety at year 4, and a series of demographic covariates at year 1. Such findings highlight various personality traits as critical antecedents of PIU. Furthermore, identifying maladaptive cognitions over Internet use as a mechanism explaining the associations between personality traits and PIU may facilitate more targeted and effective intervention efforts.

AB Carbon dots (CDots) are brightly fluorescent, especially in the same green spectral region overlapping that of the green fluorescent protein, and also benign and nontoxic. For imaging invivo, however, red/near-IR probes are required for the high optical transmittance through tissues and the contrast against interference from autofluorescence background. Herein, high-performance red/near-IR CDots are designed and prepared by modifying the core carbon nanoparticles in CDots with the incorporation of selected dye species into the nanoparticle structure. The representative modified CDots thus obtained are used as fluorescence probes in the invivo imaging of normal and tumor-bearing nude mice via various exposure pathways. The results suggest that these red/near-IR CDots are indeed excellent probes for fluorescence imaging invivo, especially with their enhanced tumor uptake. The potentially far-reaching implications of being able to design and synthesize the modified CDots of strong optical absorptions and bright fluorescence emissions in the red/near-IR are discussed in terms of their broad applicability to invivo imaging and theranostics.

AB Background: Ovarian cancer is one of the most deadly gynecological malignancies and inclined to recurrence and drug resistance. Previous studies showed that the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancers and their major histotypes are associated with genomic instability caused by defined sets of pathogenic mutations. In contrast, the mechanism that influences the development of drug resistance and disease recurrence is not well elucidated. Solid tumors are prone to chromosomal instability (CIN) and micronuclei formation (MN). Although MN is traditionally regarded as the outcome of genomic instability, recent investigation on its origin and final consequences reveal that the abnormal DNA metabolism in MN is a driver force for some types of catastrophic genomic rearrangements, accelerating dramatic genetic variation of cancer cells.
   Methods: We used Indirect Immunofluorescent staining to visualize micronuclei and activation of DNA repair factors in ovarian cancer cell lines and biopsies.
   Results: We show that ovarian cancer cells are disposed to form micronuclei upon genotoxic insults. Double strand DNA breaks (DSBs)-triggered insurgence of micronuclei is associated with unrepaired chromosomes passing through mitosis. According to their morphology and DNA staining, micronuclei compartments are divided into early and late stages that can be further characterized by differential staining of gamma H2AX and 53BP1. We also show that MN compartments do not halt controlled DNA metabolism as sequestered nuclear repair factors are enriched at DNA breaks in MN compartments and efficiently process DNA ends to generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) structures. Interestingly, unknown factors are required for DNA end processing in MN in addition to the nuclear resection machinery. Finally, these hallmarks of micronuclei evolution depicted in cell culture were recapitulated in different stages of ovarian cancer biopsies.
   Conclusions: In aggregate, our findings demonstrate that ovarian cancer cells are inclined to form micronuclei that undergo robust DNA metabolism and generate ssDNA structures, potentially destabilizing genomic structures and triggering genetic variation.

TI Efficient Hybrid Grouping Spectrum Assignment to Suppress Spectrum
   Fragments in Flexible Grid Optical Networks
SO JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY
LA English

DE Flexible grid optical networks; fragment; hybrid-grouping; routing and
   spectrum assignment
ID BANDWIDTH DEFRAGMENTATION; PATH NETWORK; ALLOCATION
AB Flexible grid optical networks (FONs) can accommodate diverse kinds of service connections with higher networking flexibility and spectrum-utilization efficiency by employing a finer resource allocation granularity (known as frequency slot) and a more sophisticated path-routing and resource-allocation algorithm (known as routing and spectrum assignment algorithm), when compared to the traditional wavelength division multiplexing optical networks. However, the continuity and the contiguity constraints in spectrum allocation may possibly introduce spectrum fragments, which cannot be utilized by the subsequent service connections and thus reduce the amount of available resources as well as the networking flexibility in FONs. Therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to decrease the amount of spectrum fragments by re-optimizing the fragmented resources. These algorithms are known as spectrum defragmentation algorithms, which always induce traffic disruption or require extra components. In order to avoid traffic disruption and the requirement of extra components, some grouping RSA algorithms have been proposed to suppress spectrum fragments from their generation by pre-dividing the spectrum resources into several either fixed or variable groups. However, since the spectrum resources in one group can only be assigned to the service connections of one specific kind, the flexibility of these grouping algorithms is always limited by the kinds of service connections. In this paper, we introduce hybrid grouping mechanism into spectrum assignment and propose a hybrid-group-based RSA algorithm, most-used-first hybrid grouping (MUFHG) RSA algorithm, to suppress the spectrum fragments generated in FONs. By employing hybrid grouping mechanism, the proposed MUFHG algorithm sorts the spectrum resources into several flexible groups with specified allocation starting FSs. And each spectrum group can accommodate several kinds of service connections if the bandwidth requirements of these service connections have multiple relations, which guarantees that the remained or the released spectrum resources in each group can always be re-used. Therefore, spectrum fragments are only generated in the spectrum bands between two adjacent flexible groups. In this way, the proposed hybrid-group-based algorithm can significantly suppress spectrum fragments from their generation. Besides, the proposed MUFHG algorithm helps improve the blocking performance of the network by employing the most-used-first strategy to maximize the number of less frequently used spectrum resources for subsequent service connections. The simulation results indicate that the proposed MUFHG algorithm gains notable reductions in both spectrum fragments and bandwidth blocking probability with neither traffic disruption nor extra components.

AB 1. Adiponectin and its receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) are novel endocrine systems that act at various levels to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism. This study was designed to investigate the spatial expression of adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 genes in various tissues in Tibetan chicken. The temporal expression of adiponectin and its receptor mRNAs were also studied in adipose tissue, breast muscle and thigh muscle and the correlations of the levels of adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA with the contents of intramuscular fat in breast muscle and thigh muscle of Tibetan chicken were determined.
   2. Quantitative real-time PCR detected chicken adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA transcripts in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.
   3. Adipose tissue contained the highest amount of adiponectin mRNA followed by the kidney and liver. The expression levels of ADIPOR1 mRNA were significantly higher in adipose tissue, lung and spleen, and adipose tissue exhibited significantly higher levels of ADIPOR2 mRNA followed by the spleen and lung compared with other tissues.
   4. Temporal expression profiles of adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA showed gender differences in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle at certain ages. In adipose tissue, adiponectin mRNA was higher in 154-d-old females and ADIPOR1 mRNA was higher in 154-d-old males: Adiponectin and ADIPOR2 mRNA were higher, and ADIPOR1 mRNA was lower, in thigh muscle in female compared with male chickens.
   5. The correlation data showed that, except for adiponectin mRNA, the levels of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA in thigh muscle of males were significantly positively correlated with IMF (r=0.206 for the ADIPOR1 gene and r=0.676 for the ADIPOR2 gene).
   6. Taken together, it was concluded that adiponectin and the ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 genes are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues of Tibetan chicken and the expression of the adiponectin system is gender-dependant at certain ages in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

AB The decoration of CNTs surface by magnetic nanoparticles was achieved by an ultrasonication-assisted hydrothermal method (UAHM). The effect of ultrasonication time on the crystal structure, magnetic performance, and chemical composition of the magnetic CNT composite material was determined. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometry were used to characterize the physical, chemical, and magnetic properties of the composites. The composites synthesized via the UAHM exhibited superparamagnetic properties. The ultrasonication time was a critical factor that affected the structure and magnetic performance of the composites. By simply controlling the ultrasonication time, the crystal phase structure of Fe oxide could be selectively modulated and the magnetic performance of the MCs could be effectively tuned.

AB LiFePO4/C cathode materials with a high tap-density originated from FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O precursors were prepared via a high-temperature solid-phase carbothermic reduction using low-cost Ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as reaction materials. The as-obtained precursors are consistent with FePO4 center dot 2H2O phase with a Pcab space group and no impurity peaks are detected by XRD. The FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O precursor prepared at 90 degrees C for 8 h and the corresponding LiFePO4/C composite show high tap-density of 1.45 g cm(-3) and 1.36 g cm(-3), respectively. The LiFePO4/C delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 159 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C. Meanwhile, an initial capacity of 95 mAh g(-1) and superior capacity retention of 96.3 % are retained after 70 cycles at a high rate of 10 degrees C.

AB Improving our knowledge of the effects of environmental factors (e.g. soil conditions, precipitation and temperature) on belowground biomass in an alpine grassland is essential for understanding the consequences of carbon storage in this biome. The object of this study is to investigate the relative importance of soil nutrients and climate factors on belowground biomass in an alpine meadow in the source region of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, Tibetan Plateau. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) contents and belowground biomass were measured at 22 sampling sites across an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. We analyzed the data by using the redundancy analysis to determine the main environmental factors affecting the belowground biomass and the contribution of each factor. The results showed that SOC, TN and TP were the main factors that influenced belowground biomass, and the contribution of SOC, TN and TP on biomass was in the range of 47.87%-72.06% at soil depths of 0-30 cm. Moreover, the combined contribution of annual mean temperature (AMT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) on belowground biomass ranged from 0.92% to 4.10%. A potential mechanism for the differences in belowground biomass was caused by the variations in soil nitrogen and phosphorous, which were coupled with SOC. A significant correlation was observed between MAP and soil nutrients (SOC, TN and TP) at the soil depth of 0-10 cm (P < 0.05). We concluded that precipitation is an important driving force in regulating ecosystem functioning as reflected in variations of soil nutrients (SOC, TN and TP) and dynamics of belowground biomass in alpine grassland ecosystems.

AB Shyness is a fundamental trait associated with social-emotional maladaptive behaviors, including many forms of psychopathology. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that hyper-responsivity to social and emotional stimuli occurs in the frontal cortex and limbic system in shy individuals, but the relationship between shyness and brain-wide functional connectivity remains incompletely understood. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we addressed this issue by exploring the relationship between regional functional connectivity strength (rFCS) and scores of shyness in a cohort of 61 healthy young adults and controlling for the effects of social and trait anxiety scores. We observed that the rFCS of the insula positively correlated with shyness scores regardless of sex. Furthermore, we found that there were significant sex-by-shyness interactions in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula (two core nodes of the salience network) as well as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex: the rFCS values of these regions positively correlated with shyness scores in females but negatively correlated in males. Taken together, we provide evidence for intrinsic functional connectivity differences in individuals with different degrees of shyness and that these differences are sex-dependent. These findings might have important implications on the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying emotional and cognitive processing associated with shyness.

   APPROACH
AB This paper addresses the asymptotic stability issue of two-dimensional (2-D) positive systems with delays described by the Roesser model. The delays are time-varying and may be unbounded. A necessary and sufficient stability condition is established, which determines if the considered system is asymptotically stable for all delays satisfying a sector bound constraint. The result is formulated as a linear programming problem and is hence computationally friendly. An example illustrates the theoretical result.

AB Teschoviruses are widely endemic and commonly found in pig fecal samples. In this study, we collected fecal specimens from various pig herds and genotyped them based on the VP1 gene. Of 322 samples, 276 were positive, giving a PTV infectivity rate of 85.7 %. PTV4 was the most common serotype found in Shanghai, followed by PTV8 and PTV10. Interestingly, Some Shanghai strains belonging to a new PTV serotype were also isolated. In phylogenetic analysis, PTV SH8 did not correspond to any known serotype. PTV4 and PTV6 showed similar levels of sequence identity to PTV SH8. These data suggest that PTV SH8 is a new serotype, distinct from the new serotype PTV wild boar/WB2C-TV/2011/HUN, which clusters with PTV SH2, SH10, and SH25.

AB Innovative industrial clusters can leverage economies of scale and synergies, thereby providing new impetus for enhancing carbon emission efficiency. This study, based on panel data from Chinese cities between 2010 and 2021, views the pilot policy of innovative industrial clusters as a quasi-natural experiment, using a difference-indifferences model to identify the causal relationship between innovative industrial clusters and carbon emission efficiency. The findings indicate that: (1) Innovative industrial clusters can significantly improve carbon emission efficiency, and this conclusion holds under multiple robustness checks; (2) Innovative industrial clusters enhance carbon emission efficiency by upgrading industrial structures, accelerating technological progress, and improving transportation efficiency; (3) The positive impact of innovative industrial clusters on carbon emission efficiency is more pronounced in cities with non-resource-based economies, higher administrative levels, greater marketization, relatively well-developed digital infrastructure, and stronger intellectual property protection; (4) Innovative industrial clusters exert a positive spatial spillover effect on carbon emission efficiency. This study is the first to examine the role of innovative industrial cluster policies in improving carbon emission efficiency, providing valuable insights and experiences for advancing sustainable development.

AB Iturin A (IA) encapsulated in chitosan (CS) microcapsules (IA/CS) underwent thorough physicochemical characterization using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM confirmed the smooth, spherical morphology of the IA/CS microcapsules, while FTIR revealed complex intermolecular interactions between IA and CS. TGA demonstrated thermal stability within the 0-100 degrees C range, while particle size analysis revealed an average diameter of 553.4 nm. To evaluate IA/CS efficacy in post-harvest grape preservation, grapes were treated with sterile water (CK), 10 g/L CS, 0.1 g/L IA/CS, and 0.1 g/L chitosan empty microcapsules (CKM), then stored at 25 degrees C for 16 days. IA/CS significantly reduced decay and respiration intensity by 52.3 % and 23.8 %, respectively, compared to CK. IA/CS treatment also inhibited abscission rate, weight loss, firmness reduction, total soluble solids consumption, titratable acidity consumption, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase activities on par with CS treatment (p > 0.05), but performed better than CK (reductions of 26.9 %, 41.2 %, 25.8 %, 27.2 %, 24.2 %, 19.4 %, and 17.4 %, respectively) and CKM (p < 0.05). Sensory evaluation confirmed that IA/CS effectively suppressed decay, slowed post-harvest metabolic activity, and maintained grape quality. Therefore, IA/CS microcapsules offer a promising method for extending grape shelf life and preserving quality.

AB The effectiveness of iturin A (IA) and chitosan (CTS) coating, alone or in combination (CTS-IA), against mango anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was investigated. In vitro tests, concentrations of IA ranging from 0.03 to 0.12 g/L, and CTS ranging from 10 g/L to 20 g/L, significantly inhibited the growth of C. gloeosporioides. Moreover, the combination of IA with 15 g/L CTS demonstrated an additional inhibitory effect on C. gloeosporioides growth. In vivo experiments, 0.12 g/L IA with 15 g/L CTS had a synergistic effect in preventing lesion expansion in mangoes after 20 days of storage at 12 degrees C. Compared to using IA or CTS alone, CTS-IA coating showed better results in disease control, respiratory rate, weight loss, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and fruit firmness maintenance during storage. The combined effect of IA and CTS may be mainly attributed to the enhancement of mango defense enzymes such as GR, CAT, APX, and POD induced by the CTS-IA. In conclusion, CTS-IA may have significant potential in postharvest preservation applications for mangoes.

AB In the context of Earth observation, change detection boils down to comparing images acquired at different times by sensors of possibly different spatial and/or spectral resolutions or different modalities (e.g., optical or radar). Even when considering only optical images, this task has proven to be challenging as soon as the sensors differ by their spatial and/or spectral resolutions. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised change detection method dedicated to images acquired by such so-called heterogeneous optical sensors. It capitalizes on recent advances which formulate the change detection task into a robust fusion framework. Adopting this formulation, the work reported in this paper shows that any off -the -shelf network trained beforehand to fuse optical images of different spatial and/or spectral resolutions can be easily complemented with a network of the same architecture and embedded into an adversarial framework to perform change detection. A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods demonstrates the versatility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Metallic lithium (Li) is highly desirable for Li battery anodes due to its unique advantages. However, the growth of Li dendrites poses challenges for commercialization. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various three-dimensional (3D) current collectors. In this study, the selective modification of a 3D Cu foam scaffold with lithiophilic elements was explored to induce controlled Li deposition. The Cu foam was selectively modified with Ag and Sn to create uniform Cu foam (U -Cu) and gradient lithiophilic Cu foam (G -Cu) structures. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ag exhibited a stronger binding energy with Li compared to Sn, indicating superior Li induction capabilities. Electrochemical testing demonstrated that the half cell with the G-Cu@Ag electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability, maintaining 550 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97.35%. This performance surpassed that of both Cu foam and G-Cu@Sn. The gradient modification of the current collectors improved the utilization of the 3D scaffold and prevented Li accumulation at the top of the scaffold. Overall, the selective modification of the 3D Cu foam scaffold with lithiophilic elements, particularly Ag, offers promising prospects for mitigating Li dendrite growth and enhancing the performance of Li batteries.

AB Rapid climate warming is altering multiple ecosystem functions of alpine grasslands. However, the responses of the above- and belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) to climate warming might exhibit difference in semi-arid alpine grasslands. Based on manipulative field experiments at an alpine meadow and an alpine steppe, we explored warming effects on the functioning of alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. Warming significantly decreased plant diversity and aboveground biomass, but tended to increase belowground biomass, soil carbon, and soil nutrient contents. Experimental warming generally had neutral effects on the EMF of both alpine grasslands. Nevertheless, warming differentially affects the above- and belowground ecosystem functioning of Tibetan semi-arid alpine grasslands, with the aboveground EMF (AEMF) deceased but the belowground EMF (BEMF) increased under warmer conditions. Our results further showed that the negative effect of experimental warming on AEMF was mainly regulated by the changes of plant and soil biodiversity. However, plant productivity had a pivotal role in propelling the positive effect of warming on BEMF. Our results emphasized the potential impacts of plant and soil biodiversity, productivity, and soil nutrients in maintaining the EMF of alpine grasslands, which could offer novel views for sustainable management of Tibetan semi -arid alpine ecosystems.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the critical pathogens causing diarrhea in piglets and has caused huge economic losses to the swine industry in worldwide. However, there is currently no effective therapeutic medication available for the treatment of PEDV. Natural compounds are a hot topic for researching and screening antiviral lead compounds due to their abundant sources, varied activities, and low toxicity. In this study, a total of 6 compounds from different plant sources were selected for in vitro anti-PEDV screening, including chrysin, naringenin, soy isoflavone, glycyrrhetinic acid, oleanolic acid, and geniposide. Then two active compounds, chrysin and naringenin, were further evaluated on PEDV infected cells at different stage. And the anti-PEDV mechanism was analyzed by molecule docking and molecular dynamics. The results showed that both chrysin and naringenin showed the most significant anti-PEDV activity by increasing the cell viability and decreasing the virus copy number. Both natural compounds could inhibit viral titer, mRNA and protein levels in the prophylactic and post-viral entry stages of PEDV infection. Furthermore, chrysin and naringenin mainly interacted with viral replicase proteins such as 3CLpro and PLP-2 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. The complexes formed by chrysin and naringenin with the two PEDV replication proteases had high stability. These results suggested that chrysin and naringenin may exert antiviral effects by interacting with the virus 3CLpro protein or PLP2 protein, thereby affecting their role in the formation of PEDV non-structural proteins or interfering with virus replication. This study lays the foundation for developing chrysin and naringenin as novel anti-PEDV therapeutic drugs.

DE Graph neural network; Graph isomorphism network; Explainability
AB Deep learning, in particular graph neural network (GNN), has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the relationship between crystal structures and materials properties. Based on the highly discriminative graph isomorphism network (GIN) algorithm, we present an improved GIN that incorporates edge features during the node feature aggregation and adjusts more weights to important nodes at both local and global levels. We show that our model can achieve comparable or better performance on the Matbench suite compared to some previously reported GNNs and the improvement is significantly greater on small datasets. Although GNNs tend to have good performance in accuracy, the black-box nature of GNNs hinders their application in materials domains to some extent. After training our model, we use t-stochastic neighbour embedding visualization and perturbation-based method to provide a straightforward and comprehensive explanation to increase the transparency and credibility of the model. We demonstrate the superiority of the presented framework in terms of accuracy and explainability. This is crucial for the design of novel materials.

AB Zn and its alloys are receiving increasing interest for biodegradable orthopedic implant applications owing to their moderate corrosion rate and the potential functionality of Zn2+. However, their non-uniform corrosion behavior and insufficient osteogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties do not meet the comprehensive requirements of orthopedic implants in clinical use. Herein, an aspirin (an acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, 10, 50, 100, and 500 mg/L)-loaded carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)/gelatin (Gel)-Zn2+ organometallic hydrogel composite coating (CMC/Gel&Zn2+/ASA) was fabricated on a Zn surface via an alternating dip-coating method, aiming to obtain a material with these comprehensive properties improved. The organometallic hydrogel composite coatings, ca. 12-16 mu m in thickness, showed compact, homogeneous, and micro-bulge structured surface morphology. The coatings protected well the Zn substrate from pitting/localized corrosion and contained the release of the bioactive components, Zn2+ and ASA, in a sustained and stable manner in long-term in vitro immersions in Hank's solution. The coated Zn showed greater ability to promote proliferation and osteogenic differentiation for MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, and better anti-inflammatory capacity when compared with uncoated Zn. Additionally, this coating displayed excellent antibacterial activity against both Escherichia coli (>99 % antibacterial rate) and Staphylococcus aureus (>98 % antibacterial rate). Such appealing properties can be attributed to the compositional nature of the coating, namely the sustained release of Zn2+ and ASA, as well as the surface physiochemical properties because of its unique microstructure. This organometallic hydrogel composite coating can be considered a promising option for the surface modification of biodegradable Zn-based orthopedic implants among others.

AB A new counterion-induced small-molecule micelle (SM) with surface charge-switchable activities for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections is proposed. The amphiphilic molecule formed by zwitterionic compound and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP), via a "mild salifying reaction" of the amino and benzoic acid groups, can spontaneously assemble into counterion-induced SMs in water. Through vinyl groups designed on zwitterionic compound, the counterion-induced SMs could be readily cross-linked using mercapto-3, 6-dioxoheptane by click reaction, to create pH-sensitive cross-linked mi-celles (CSMs). Mercaptosuccinic acid was also decorated on the CSMs (DCSMs) by the same click reaction to afford charge-switchable activities, resulting in CSMs that were biocompatible with red blood cells and mammalian cells in normal tissues (pH 7.4), while having strong retention to negatively charged bacterial surfaces at infection sites, based on electrostatic interaction (pH 5.5). As a result, the DCSMs could pene-trate deep into bacterial biofilms and then release drugs in response to the bacterial microenvironment, effectively killing the bacteria in the deeper biofilm. The new DCSMs have several advantages such as ro-bust stability, a high drug loading content ( - 30%), easy fabrication, and good structural control. Overall, the concept holds promise for the development of new products for clinical application. Statement of significance We fabricated a new counterion-induced small-molecule micelle with surface charge-switchable activi-ties (DCSMs) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Compared with reported covalent systems, the DCSMs not only have improved stability, high drug loading content ( - 30%), and good biosafety, but also have the environmental stimuli response, and antibacterial activity of the original drugs. As a result, the DCSMs exhibited enhanced antibacterial activities against MRSA both in vitro and in vivo . Overall, the concept holds promise for the development of new products for clinical application. & COPY; 2023 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Naringin has various biological activities with an unacceptable bitter taste. In this work, pea protein-naringin complexes (PP-NG complexes) were constructed to stabilise the Pickering emulsion and reduce the bitterness of naringin. Sensory evaluation results showed that the bitterness and after-bitterness of the PP-NG complexes were reduced by 77.78% and 75.99% compared with 1 mm naringin respectively. For the PP-NG complexes, the fluorescence spectra results showed that the endogenous fluorescence intensity of pea protein decreased with the naringin concentration increased (0-2 mm), and each pea protein molecule bound to one naringin molecule. Results obtained via thermodynamic analysis molecular docking demonstrated that naringin had an excellent binding affinity (-7.4 kcal mol(-1)) with pea protein and could form five hydrophobic bonds and four hydrogen bonds with pea protein. These findings would provide a new idea for the masking of bitterness and the evolution of Pickering emulsions stabilised by the protein-polyphenol nanoparticles.

AB Rational design and scalable production of core-shell sulfur-rich active materials is vital for not only the practical success of future metal-sulfur batteries but also for a deep insight into the core-shell design for sulfur-based electrochemistry. However, this is a big challenge mainly due to the lack of efficient strategy for realizing precisely controlled core-shell structures. Herein, by harnessing the frictional heating and dispersion capability of the nanostorm technology developed in the authors' laboratory, it is surprisingly found that sulfur-rich active particles can be coated with on-demand shell nanomaterials in seconds. To understand the process, a micro-adhesion guided nano-vapor deposition (MAG-NVD) working mechanism is proposed. Enabled by this technology, customizable nano-shell is realized in a super-efficient and solvent-free way. Further, the different roles of shell characteristics in affecting the sulfur-cathode electrochemical performance are discovered and clarified. Last, large-scale production of calendaring-compatible cathode with the optimized core-shell active materials is demonstrated, and a Li-S pouch-cell with 453 Wh kg(-1)@0.65 Ah is also reported. The proposed nano-vapor deposition may provide an attractive alternative to the well-known physical and chemical vapor deposition technologies.

AB Key messageTwo candidate genes (ZmbZIP113 and ZmTSAH1) controlling low-temperature germination ability were identified by QTL-seq and integrative transcriptomic analyses. The functional verification results showed that two candidate genes positively regulated the low-temperature germination ability of IB030.Low-temperature conditions cause slow maize (Zea mays L.) seed metabolism, resulting in slow seedling emergence and irregular seedling emergence, which can cause serious yield loss. Thus, improving a maize cultivar's low-temperature germination ability (LTGA) is vital for increasing yield production. Wild relatives of maize, such as Z. perennis and Tripsacum dactyloides, are strongly tolerant of cold stress and can thus be used to improve the LTGA of maize. In a previous study, the genetic bridge MTP was constructed (from maize, T. dactyloides, and Z. perennis) and used to obtain a highly LTGA maize introgression line (IB030) by backcross breeding. In this study, IB030 (Strong-LTGA) and Mo17 (Weak-LTGA) were selected as parents to construct an F-2 offspring. Additionally, two major QTLs (qCS1-1 and qCS10-1) were mapped. Then, RNA-seq was performed using seeds of IB030 and the recurrent parent B73 treated at 10 degrees C for 27 days and 25 degrees C for 7 days, respectively, and two candidate genes (ZmbZIP113 and ZmTSAH1) controlling LTGA were located using QTL-seq and integrative transcriptomic analyses. The functional verification results showed that the two candidate genes positively regulated LTGA of IB030. Notably, homologous cloning showed that the source of variation in both candidate genes was the stable inheritance of introgressed alleles from Z. perennis. This study was thus able to analyze the LTGA mechanism of IB030 and identify resistance genes for genetic improvement in maize, and it proved that using MTP genetic bridge confers desirable traits or phenotypes of Z. perennis and tripsacum essential to maize breeding systems.

AB With the implementation of the patient-mobility policy and the development of intercity transportation in China, interprovincial patient mobility has become an important phenomenon. However, little is known whether or to what extent intercity transportation reshapes the delivery of high-quality health care. This study mapped the accessibility of 41,259 township-level divisions to 1152 tertiary hospitals in multiple patient-mobility scenarios according to whether to seek interprovincial health care and whether to adopt intercity transportation. Our analysis included different transportation systems, such as conventional rail, high-speed rail (HSR), and air transport. Then the geographical detector model was used to contrast the spatial influences of different acces-sibility patterns on mortality. Our results show that HSR had the largest influence on the utilization of high -quality health care, while air transport was statistically insignificant. HSR can promote the equitable distribu-tion of high-quality health care in that HSR decreases the Gini index and urban-rural disparity in accessibility by 9.52% and 13.25%, respectively. Further, a synergistic effect exists between the intercity transportation and the patient-mobility policy, which could reduce the Gini index and urban-rural disparity in accessibility by an additional 5.07% and 22.50%, respectively. Achieving high-quality universal health coverage relies on sus-tainable transportation policies and services.

ID PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES
AB Zinc-ion battery is regarded as one of the potential alternatives for advanced energy storage system, due to its high discharge capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. The research and development of new electrode materials and reaction mechanism for zinc-ion battery have attracted most attention. Herein, cerium oxide is systematically investigated as a novel cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion battery. The battery charge and discharge test results show that cerium oxide has a discharge specific capacity comparable to that of manganese oxide cathode material, the discharge specific capacity is stable at 143.8 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles. The cyclic voltammetry curves and charge-discharge curves of cerium oxide are very similar to manganese oxide cathode materials. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrate that the perfor-mance of cerium oxide as a cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion battery is related to the reaction product of zinc sulfate hydroxide hydrate and manganese ion in the electrolyte. And it is found that the discharge cut-off voltage also plays a crucial role in the discharge capacity of the aqueous zinc-ion battery with manganese ion.

AB Continued global climate and environmental changes have led to habitat narrowing or migration of medicinal plants. Gentiana rhodantha Franch. ex Hemsl. is a medicinal plant for ethnic minorities in China, and it has a remarkable curative effect in the treatment of lung-heat cough. However, its habitat is gradually decreasing, and the species has been listed as an endangered ethnic medicine due to excessive harvesting. Here, based on CMIP6 bioclimatic data and 117 species occurrence records, the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), combined with ArcGIS technology, was applied to predict the potentially suitable habitats for G. rhodantha under different climate scenarios. The results showed that the most critical bioclimatic variables affecting G. rhodantha are the precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio18) and the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (Bio11). The highly suitable habitats of G. rhodantha are mainly concentrated in Belt and Road ("B&R") countries, including China, Bhutan, and Vietnam. However, under different climate change scenarios, the fragmentation extent of suitable habitats in China will generally increase, the suitable area will show a decreasing trend as a whole, the distribution center will shift to the northeast, and the distance will increase with time. Notably, the shrinkage of the high suitability area was the most obvious for the 2081-2100 SSP585 scenario, with a total of 358,385.2 km(2). These findings contribute to the understanding of the geo-ecological characteristics of this species, and provide guidelines for the conservation, management, monitoring, and cultivation of G. rhodantha.

AB Panax notoginseng is a rare medicinal and edible plant widely used for multi-treatments, and in this study, a polysaccharide Pnp was prepared from P. notoginseng, and its structure and biology activities were investigated. Results showed that the molecular weight of Pnp was 78.6 kDa, and Pnp mainly consisted of -*2,4)-alpha-L-Rhap- (1-*,-*5)-alpha-L-Araf-(1-* and-*4)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-* residues with acetyl groups. Furthermore, the macrophages were activated the immunologic function after TLR2 and MR recognizing Pnp. Besides, Pnp could be durative utilized by the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum and the account of viable cells kept at 9.5 log CFU/mL for 72h. The hydrophobicity and the short-chain fatty acids levels (especially butyric acid) of L. plantarum were enhanced by Pnp, which indicated that Pnp exerted beneficial effects on the host health. The results laid a solid foundation for the exploitation of Pnp as a nutraceutical and functional candidate in the food industry.

AB Plant functional traits play important roles in determining plant responses to environmental change and further shaping community composition, but the role of plant stoichiometry remains poorly understood in regulating community responses to continually increased nitrogen (N) deposition. In this paper, we used a 5-year manipulative experiment with six N addition rates (N-rate) to explore how the N response of different plant functional groups including forbs, grasses, sedges and legumes links to above-ground plant carbon-to-N ratio (C:N, related to N use strategies) in an alpine meadow. We found that plant C:N explained 45.8% and 42.6% of N response variation among functional groups in plant above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and abundance. Over increasing N-rate, functional groups with higher C:N (grasses and sedges) tended to grow better and have greater abundance, yet those with lower C:N (forbs and legumes) were at risk of loss, subsequently mitigating the N-caused decline in community-level plant C:N. This was mainly due to that functional groups with higher C:N not only possessed higher N use efficiency but also had greater competitiveness for above-ground light due to higher plant height. In addition, we also found that plant C:N differences among functional groups remained relatively constant over N-rate, suggesting that the ability of this trait to indicate functional group-specific N responses was stable. Synthesis. Our results show that the N responses of different herbaceous plants can be well explained by plant C:N. Thus, we suggest the prediction of plant community composition changes under N deposition would be greatly improved by considering this easily measured stoichiometric trait.

AB Three peptides (LL, LML, and LLL) were used to examine their influences on the osmotic stress tolerance and cell wall properties of brewer's yeast. Results suggested that peptide supplementation improved the osmotic stress tolerance of yeast through enhancing the integrity and stability of the cell wall. Transmission electron micrographs showed that the thickness of yeast cell wall was increased by peptide addition under osmotic stress. Additionally, quantitative analysis of cell wall polysaccharide components in the LL and LLL groups revealed that they had 27.34% and 24.41% higher chitin levels, 25.73% and 22.59% higher mannan levels, and 17.86% and 21.35% higher beta-1,3-glucan levels, respectively, than the control. Furthermore, peptide supplementation could positively modulate the cell wall integrity pathway and up-regulate the expressions of cell wall remodeling-related genes, including FKS1, FKS2, KRE6, MNN9, and CRH1. Thus, these results demonstrated that peptides improved the osmotic stress tolerance of yeast via remodeling the yeast cell wall and reinforcing the structure of the cell wall.

TI Nuclear ribonucleoprotein RALY targets virus nucleocapsid protein and
   induces autophagy to restrict porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
   replication
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPRESSION; INFECTION
AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea and dehydration in pigs and leads to great economic losses in the commercial swine industry. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of host response to viral infection remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated a novel mechanism by which RALY, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, significantly promotes the degradation of the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, we identified an interaction between RALY and the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (membrane-associated RINGCH 8), as well as the cargo receptor NDP52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kDa), suggesting that RALY could suppress PEDV replication by degrading the viral N protein through a RALYMARCH8-NDP52-autophagosome pathway. Collectively, these results suggest a preventive role of RALY against PEDV infection via the autophagy pathway and open up the possibility of inducing RALY in vivo as an effective prophylactic and preventive treatment for PEDV infection.

AB Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors show potent antiproliferative activity in treatment with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the emergence of safety issues and drug-resistance of PARP inhibitors prompt us to search for new strategies. It was proved that Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is more effective than traditional small molecule which can induce target proteins degradation rather than inhibition. In this article, based on the Olaparib derivatives and cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase ligands, a series of PARP1 degraders, with linkers bearing different length and type were designed and synthesized. Among them, compound LB23 showed efficacious antiproliferative activity in various human cancer cells and can induce PARP1 protein degradation effectively. Moreover, LB23 showed 60-fold degradation selectivity in tumor cells with low degradation toxicity in normal cells. This study shows that the PROTAC tumor selectivity can be optimized by tuning the length and composition of the linker.

AB This paper studies the stability problem and H(infinity )performance of networked control system (NCS) in the presence of mixed attacks by developing an improved event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Firstly, both aperiodic denial of service (DoS) attacks and random deception attacks are encountered for investigating system dynamic behavior. Then, a resilient optimized dynamic event-triggered mechanism (RODETM) is proposed for reducing the unnecessary costs of system operation and mitigating the impact caused by attacks. On this basis, the standard NCS is reformulated into a switched system under the mixed attacks. Further, using the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, average dwell time scheme and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, some sufficient conditions with control design implementation are obtained, which can ensure the exponential stability with the expected prescribed H-infinity performance index of the studied system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by using a numerical simulation with comparative analysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fluorescence anisotropy/polarization is an attractive and versatile technique based on molecular rotation in biochemical/biophysical systems. Traditional fluorescence anisotropy/polarization assays showed relatively low sensitivity for molecule detection, because widespread molecular masses are too small to produce detectable changes in fluorescence anisotropy/polarization value. In this review, we discuss in detail how the potential of fluorescence anisotropy/polarization signal approach considerably expanded through the implementation of mass amplification, recycle the target amplification, fluorescence probes structure-switching amplification, resonance energy transfer amplification, and provide perspectives at future directions and applications.

AB Enzymolysis kinetics, thermodynamics and molecular conformation of brewer's spent grain protein (BSGP) pretreated with ultrasound were examined. Results showed that ultrasound pretreatment significantly reduced Michaelis constant (K-m) and the thermodynamic parameters, including activation energy (E-a), enthalpy (Delta H), entropy (Delta S) and Gibbs free energy (Delta G) of BSGP during enzymolysis. Moreover, the initial reaction rate (V-i), association constant (K-a) and reaction rate constants (k) of BSGP pretreated with ultrasound were higher than those of native BSGP. The spectral analysis with Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) manifested that ultrasound pretreatment exposed hydrophobic groups and induced molecular unfolding of BSGP. Particle size analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that ultrasound pretreatment decreased particle size while increasing flexibility of BSGP. All these structural changes resulted in the improvement on enzymolysis efficiency of BSGP pretreated with ultrasound. Therefore, ultrasound pretreatment could be an efficient method to enhance the enzymolysis sensibility of BSGP. (C) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Currently, the development of industry is becoming increasingly rapid. Technicalization, informatization and industrialization give the fundamental impetus for industrial development and progress. Nevertheless, there are numerous problems that are hindering industrial progress and threatening human security in the industrial field. The surface defects of the workpieces are one of the primary problems. Moreover, defects of multi-type, mixed and unapparent characteristics presented by workpieces make the detection and classification of workpiece more difficult. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) show strong ability of feature extraction and mines deeper essential features of data because of its features of unique receptive field structure and weights of shared. It can represent original data information well and obtain results more accurately than the traditional methods. But there also remains a problem that conventional DCNN has a huge number of parameters and computation, which brings great pressure to the equipment in terms of computing power, memory, speed and so on. Based on this situation, the optimization methods of CNNs model in the aspects of data, structure, algorithm are summarized. Related lightweight structures and networks are also summarized in this paper. The purpose of these work is to reduce the number of parameters and computation and improve the training performance. At the same time, the research on defect classification of workpieces based on traditional machine learning and deep learning model is reviewed, and the research on defect classification of workpieces based on deeply optimized CNNs is referred and prospected.

AB Mesangial cell (MC)-mediated glomerulonephritis is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease, with immune inflammatory damage and fibrosis as its basic pathological processes. However, the treatment of glomerulonephritis remains challenging owing to limited drug accumulation and serious side effects. Hence, the specific codelivery of "anti-intlammatory/antifibrosis" drugs to the glomerular MC region is expected to yield better therapeutic effects. In this study, liposome-nanoparticle hybrids (Au-LNHy) were formed by coating the surface of gold nanoparticles with a phospholipid bilayer; the Au-LNHys formed were comodified with PEG and alpha 8 integrin antibodies to obtain gold nanoparticle immunoliposomes (Au-ILs). Next, the Au-ILs were loaded with dexamethasone and TGF beta 1 siRNA to obtain DXMS/siRNA@Au-ILs. Our results showed that the functionalized nanoparticles had a core-shell structure, a uniform and suitable particle size, low cytotoxicity, and good MC entry, and lysosomal escape abilities. The nanoparticles were found to exhibit enhanced retention in glomerular MCs due to anti-alpha 8 integrin antibody mediation. In vivo and in vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed the enhanced efficacy of DXMS/siRNA@Au-ILs modified with a8 integrin antibodies in the treatment of glomerulonephritis. In addition, DXMS/siRNA@Au-ILs were capable of effectively reducing the expression levels of TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, and other cytokines, thereby improving pathological inflammatory and fibrotic conditions in the kidney, and significantly mediating the dual regulation of inflammation and fibrosis. In summary, our results demonstrated that effectively targeting the MCs of the glomerulus for drug delivery can inhibit local inflammation and fibrosis and produce better therapeutic effects, providing a new strategy and promising therapeutic approach for the development of targeted therapies for glomerular diseases.

AB An on-line photochemical vapor generation (PCVG) method for highly sensitive speciation analysis of selenium was proposed by using metal organic framework (MOF) MIL-125-NH2 as a catalyst. When it was coupled with HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography)-ICPMS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) for Se separation and detection, inorganic selenium species (Se(IV) and Se(VI)) were firstly separated in HPLC with Na2CO3-NaHCO3 as an eluent, and then mixed with MIL-125-NH2 nanoparticles and formic acid in the PCVG reactor to form gaseous selenium-containing species under ultraviolet irradiation, which was introduced into ICPMS for selenium measurement after gas-liquid separation from the reaction solution. Experimental factors of HPLC separation, PCVG reaction and ICPMS detection were carefully investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) for Se(IV) and Se(VI) were found to be both as low as 0.8 ng/mL. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of Se(IV) and Se(VI) were 4.6% and 3.7% at 20 ng/mL (n = 11), respectively. Certified reference materials and bottled natural mineral water samples were successfully analyzed by the proposed method.

AB In this study, a novel bio-electroreduction microbial fuel cell (BEMFC) assisted by stainless-steel based Cobalt/Molybdenum/Manganese (Co/Mo/Mn-SS) polycrystalline catalytic electrode was used to achieve high recovery to silver. The exoelectrogens (Shewanella sp. etc.) using organic wastewater (the inflow was controlled at 1.2 L d(-1)) as nutrient matrix in the anode chamber generated electrons, while silver ions were simultaneously electroreduced and electmdeposited on the surface of the catalytic electrode as electron acceptors. Silver nanoplates could be observed directly. The products of electroreduction on the cathode were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), and the results of electrochemical characterization confirmed the existence of silver in the products. In the operation, the silver ions were in-situ recovered and enriched from the initial concentration of 20-300 mg L-1 to almost complete recovery (8-18 h), with the maximum power density of 1008.2 mW m(-2) and 5.5 A m(-2) current density. The recovery efficiency of silver in the BEMFC using the Co/Mo/Mn-SS electrode was up to 9.60 kg m(-2) h(-1), and the energy efficiency was 27.8 kg kWh(-1). Under the continuous flow operation mode, the BEMFC still achieved 90.2% recovery efficiency of the silver.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is one of the most important factors to affect meat quality in livestock and induce insulin resistance and adverse metabolic phenotypes for humans. However, the key regulators involved in this process remain largely unknown. Although liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was reported to participate in the development of skeletal muscles and classical adipose tissues. Due to the specific autonomic location of intramuscular adipocytes, deposited between or within muscle bundles, the exact roles of LKB1 in IMF deposition need further verified. Here, we cloned the goat LKB1 coding sequence with 1,317 bp, encoding a 438 amino acid peptide. LKB1 was extensively expressed in detected tissues and displayed a trend from decline to rise during intramuscular adipogenesis. Functionally, knockdown of LKB1 by two individual siRNAs enhanced the intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation, accompanied by promoting lipid accumulation and inducing adipogenic transcriptional factors and triglyceride synthesis-related genes expression. Conversely, overexpression of LKB1 restrained these biological signatures. To further explore the mechanisms, the RNA-seq technique was performed to compare the difference between siLKB1 and the control group. There were 1,043 differential expression genes (DEGs) were screened, i.e., 425 upregulated genes and 618 downregulated genes in the siLKB1 group. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis predicted that the DEGs were mainly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway and its classical downstream signal, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Specifically, knockdown of LKB1 increased the mRNA level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vice versa in LKB1-overexpressed cells, a key component of the activated focal adhesion pathway. Convincingly, blocking this pathway by a specific FAK inhibitor (PF573228) rescued the observed phenotypes in LKB1 knockdown adipocytes. In conclusion, LKB1 inhibited goat intramuscular adipogenesis through the focal adhesion pathway. This work expanded the genetic regulator networks of IMF deposition and provided theoretical support for improving human health and meat quality from the aspect of IMF deposition.

AB Background: Bovine group A rotavirus (BoRVA) is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis in newborn dairy calves. Only one study has investigated the G and P genotypes among dairy calves in a few regions of China, which were G6 and P[5]. Therefore, data on the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BoRVA in dairy calves in China remains limited. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BoRVA in dairy calves in China. Methods: 269 dairy calves diarrheic samples from 23 farms in six provinces in China were collected to detect BoRVA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: 71% of samples were determined to be BoRVA-positive. Two G genotypes (G6, G10) and two P genotypes (P[1], P[5]) were identified, and G6P[1] BoRVA was the predominant strain. Moreover, the VP7 and VP4 gene sequences of these dairy calf BoRVA strains revealed abundant genetic diversity. Interestingly, eight out of 17 complete G6 VP7 sequences were clustered into G6 lineage VI and analysis showed the strains were closely related to Chinese yak BoRVA strains. Conclusions: The results of this study show that BoRVA circulates widely among dairy calves in China, and the dominant genotype in circulation is G6P[1], first report on molecular characteristics of complete P[5] VP4 genes in chinese dairy calves. These results will help us to further understand the prevalence and genetic evolution of BoRVA among dairy calves in China and, thus, prevent the disease more effectively.

AB Terahertz (THz) radar imaging has widely adopted for security screening of standoff human body in recent years, owing to its capacities of high resolution, harmless, contactless, and penetrate clothing. However, THz radar security screening for walking human is still a challenge due to the non-rigid motion of walking. To figure it out, a THz radar security screening method for walking human torso is proposed with multi-angle synthetic aperture. In this method, the echo data of walking human torso component is assumed as a rigid motion model within a short time. Particularly, the torso component has the maximum ratio of surface area and echo energy, which means that its motion phase error can be detected after fractional Fourier transform processing. Besides, after the correction and imaging processing, the imaging results under different angles are fused by coherent integration with registration processing to improve the integrity of scattering information, which is incomplete within a short aperture due to self-occlusion and the changes in incident angles. The simulation experiments are conducted to verify the imaging quality and feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, the real small aperture echo data of moving torso collected by our THz radar (that operates at 330GHz with the bandwidth of 30GHz and the output peak power of 5mW) is processed via the proposed method to indicate the significance of multi-angle imaging.

AB Protecting data integrity and achieving non-repudiation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is very essential during data communication from one sensor to another. However, wireless sensor network nodes are severely limited by power, communication bandwidth, and storage space, so the traditional signature algorithm cannot be adapted to the environment. In this paper, we have proposed a certificateless aggregate signature scheme (CL-ASS) for WSNs. This scheme not only can significantly reduce the bandwidth consumed by network transmission and the occupancy of node storage space but also provides high privacy. In the random oracle model, we demonstrate the security of the scheme against two types of adversaries, under the assumption of the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) Problem. Finally, the performance analysis shows that our scheme has an ideal computational and communication cost.

AB Designing and preparing polyaniline (PANI)-based flexible electrode materials with special nanostructure hold critical promise as capacitive materials. Here, the PANIs were synthesized in HCl, H2SO4, phytic acid and HPF6 reaction systems with the same concentration via fast microwave-assisted chemical polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted to characterize their nanostructures and chemical compositions. Results reveal an apparent influence of acidic types on PANI morphology and nanostructures. The HPF6-doped PANI/carbon cloth (F-PANI/CC) show the morphology of 3D honeycomb-like nanosheets and highly ordered phenazine-like oligomeric structure as well as higher homogeneous protonation of PANI backbones on the substrate of carbon cloth (CC). These main features favor the formation of rich electron centers, density of electric charges, and better contact and reaction between PANI materials and electrolyte. As a consequence, the assembled F-PANI/CC-based symmetric solid-state supercapacitor exhibits favorable electrochemical performance with a maximum energy density of 32.6 Wh kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 1693 W kg(-1) at a voltage window of 1.0 V compared with other PANI electrode materials. This work would inspire the HPF6-doped PANI electrode materials for high-performance flexible supercapacitors. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background The yak (Bos grunniens) is an important livestock species that can survive the extremely cold, harsh, and oxygen-poor conditions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and provide meat, milk, and transportation for the Tibetans living there. However, the regulatory network that drive this hypoxic adaptation remain elusive. Results The heart tissues from LeiRoqi (LWQY) yak and their related cattle (Bos Taurus) breeds, which are two native cattle breeds located in high altitude (HAC) and low altitude (LAC) regions, respectively, were collected for RNA sequencing. A total of 178 co-differentially expressed protein-coding transcripts (co-DETs) were discovered in each of the LAC-vs-LWQY and LAC-vs-HAC comparison groups, including NFATC2, NFATC1, ENPP2, ACSL4, BAD, and many other genes whose functions were reported to be associated with the immune-system, endocrine-system, and lipid metabolism. Two and 230 lncRNA transcripts were differentially expressed in the LAC-vs-LWQY and LAC-vs-HAC comparisons' respectively, but no lncRNA transcripts that were co-differentially expressed. Among the 58 miRNAs that were co-differentially expressed, 18 were up-regulated and 40 were down-regulated. In addition, 640 (501 up-regulated and 139 down-regulated) and 152 (152 up-regulated and one down-regulated) circRNAs showed differential expression in LAC-vs-LWQY and LAC-vs-HAC comparison groups, respectively, and 53 up-regulated co-differentially expressed circRNAs were shared. Multiple co-DETs, which are the targets of miRNAs/lncRNAs, are significantly enriched in high-altitude adaptation related processes, such as, T cell receptor signaling, VEGF signaling, and cAMP signaling. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed by integrating the competing relationships among co-differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs. Furthermore, the hypoxic adaptation related ceRNA network was constructed, and the six mRNAs (MAPKAPK3, PXN, NFATC2, ATP7A, DIAPH1, and F2R), the eight miRNAs (including miR-195), and 15 circRNAs (including novel-circ-017096 and novel-circ-018073) are proposed as novel and promising candidates for regulation of hypoxic adaptation in the heart. Conclusion In conclusion, the data recorded in the present study provides new insights into the molecular network of high-altitude adaptation along with more detailed information of protein-coding transcripts and non-coding transcripts involved in this physiological process, the detailed mechanisms behind how these transcripts "crosstalk" with each other during the plateau adaptation are worthy of future research efforts.

AB Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) includes long-chained fluorosurfactants, for instance, perfluorooctanonate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS). In order to find out alternative fluorosurfactants, we synthesized eight amine oxides with a fluoroether chain. Their surface properties were evaluated and compared with perfluoroalkyl and hydrocarbon analogues. The surface tensions at critical micelle concentration (gamma cmc) for the eight amine oxides with a fluoroether chain were at a range from 15.5 to 23.0 mN/m, and gamma cmc of four fluoroether amine oxides were below 17 mN/m comparable to perfluorooctyl analogues (16.4 mN/m) and much lower than perfluorohexyl (20.5 mN/m) and hydrocarbon analogues (24.2 and 24.7 mN/m). The critical micelle concentration (cmc) for the eight amine oxides with a fluoroether chain were 3 to 535 x 10(-4) mol/L. The cmc of four fluoroether amine oxides were 3 to 21 x 10(-4) mol/L (0.2 to 1.0 g/L) comparable to perfluorooctyl (0.4 g/L) and hydrocarbon analogues (4 and 10 x 10(-4) mol/L) and much lower than perfluorohexyl analogue (36.9 g/L). The surface excesses, the limiting molecule areas and the free energies of micellization of amine oxides were calculated. Fluoroether surfactants are promising alternatives for PFOA and PFOS.

AB Hydroxyapatites (HAPs) are usually coated on the surface of an implant to improve the osseointegration with defect bone tissue. Besides, conducting polymers have the advantages of good conductivity, reasonable biocompatibility, and easy of modification, which endow them applicable to electrical stimulation therapy. However, it still remains a great challenge to fabricate hybrid coating combing HAP with conducting polymer on implant surface efficiently. In this work, phytic acid-doped polyaniline (PANI) were successfully synthesized on medical titanium (Ti) sheets. By virtue of the abundant anodic phosphoric groups of phytic acid, HAP nanocrystals were biomineralized on PANI. The PANI-HAP hybrid layer exhibits good cell compatibility with MC3T3 cells. More importantly, HAP nanocrystals and PANI operate synergistically on cell proliferation and osteogenesis through electrical stimulation. Alkaline phosphatase activity and extracellular calcium contents of cells on PANI-HAP display 3-fold and 2.6-fold increases, compared with bare Ti sheets, respectively. The valid integration of mineralization and electrical stimulation in this work renders an efficient strategy for implant coating, which might have potential applications in bone-related defects.

AB An increasing number of Bacillus strains have been developed for use as animal feed additives. The aim of the current work was to evaluate the impacts of Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 in growth performance, organs development, blood constituents, genes expression of growth and immune in spleen and microbial communities in jejunum of weanling mice. The results showed that the body weight of mice in BP1 group increased significantly (p < 0.05) after feeding Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09. Compared with control group, the feed conversion ratio of BP1 and BP2 groups showed 13.57% (p < 0.05) and 9.64% improvements, respectively. The lengths of large intestine, small intestine in BP1 group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). While compared with control group, the organ indexes in BP1 and BP2 group did not differ significantly. Compared with control group, the activities of serum total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), lysozyme (LZM) in BP1 group and T-SOD, AKP in BP2 group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with control group, the expressions of ghrelin-2 (Ghrl-2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) in BP1 group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with control group, the expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide synthase (INOS), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in BP1 group and the expressions of IL-6, INOS, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and interferon alpha 11 (Ifna11) in BP2 group were slightly decreased. Moreover, compared with control group, the diversity of intestinal flora and relative abundance of potentially probiotics (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Bacillus) in BP1 and BP2 groups were increased. While compared with control group, the relative abundance of the potentially pathogenic bacterium (e.g., Staphylococcus) was reduced. The relative abundances of dominant species in BP1 (Lactobacillus johnsonii) and BP2 (Lactobacillus reuteri) groups were also higher than control group (Lactobacillus intestinalis). In conclusion, Bacillus pumilus fsznc-09 might improve the growth performance and immunity of mice.

AB The growth of the economy in the tropics is faster than that in the rest of the world. However, whether this growth can have impacts on the environmental quality in the tropics is still a question. Here, we first introduce the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity as an environmental indicator and then investigate the relationships between gross domestic product per capita, sectoral economies, and the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity for different income countries in the tropics from 1995 to 2018. By using panel models, we find that there exists a significantly negative effect of the growth of gross domestic product per capita on terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity in the full panel and at low-income and lower middle-income levels but not at the upper middle-income level. The sectoral economies have different effects on the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity at different income levels. Interestingly, the industrial sector dominates the degradation of the terrestrial carbon sequestra-tion capacity in the lower middle-income countries; the agricultural sector exerts a significantly negative impact on the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity at the low-income and upper middle-income levels, but largely offset by the growth of the service sector. These findings suggest that the balance between economic development and the natural environment is required for economic sustainability in the tropics. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After the removal of Pb (II) from wastewater by Fe-Mg metal-organic complex adsorbent (Fe-Mg-BDC) without desorption, As(V) was removed again by the formed complex of Fe-Pb(Mg)-BDC. The results showed that Fe-MgBDC could effectively remove Pb(II), and the removal mechanism was ion exchange. As(V) was also removed efficiently and rapidly by Fe-Pb(Mg)-BDC saturated with Pb(II). In particular, Fe-Pb(Mg)-BDC had a good adsorption capacity on As (V) at low concentrations, and could control the concentration of As (V) below the standard concentration of drinking water. Moreover, Fe-Pb(Mg)-BDC had a good renewable ability. Therefore, Fe-Mg organometallic complexes had a certain application prospect in the removal of oxygen-containing anions and cations.

AB Simple Summary
   The development of rumen plays vital roles on the growth performance of calves. Rumen development is determined by rumen microorganisms, their metabolic products, and diet. Volatile fatty acids produced by ruminal microbes are one of the major determinants of ruminal papillary size and shape. Feed particle size could affect the development of rumen. Whether the roughage length determines the rumen development through the rumen microflora or not is worthy of investigation. The aim of this study was to investigate the comprehensive effects of roughage length and rumen bacterial community on the rumen development of weaned calves. Our results indicated that chopping roughage increased the ruminal bacteria involved in increasing the production of butyrate and promoted the process of bacterial colonization. This study illustrated chopping roughage at a short length could improve the rumen development and promote a stable rumen bacterial community of weaned calves.
   Roughage particle size can influence rumen development, which is also determined by rumen microorganisms and their metabolic end-products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the comprehensive effects of roughage length and rumen bacterial community on the rumen development of weaned calves. A total of thirty-six weaned Angus female calves (125 +/- 3 d; 161.2 +/- 13.0 kg) were randomly assigned to three diets differing in roughage particle size: 4 cm (short length); 24 cm (medium length); and 44 cm (long length). Results showed that chopping roughage increased dry matter intake and organic matter apparent digestibility; altered rumen fermentation indicated by the increased rumen butyrate and valerate concentrations; and increased plasma glucose, cholesterol, and total protein. Chopping roughage affected rumen bacterial community, as indicated by altering the diversity indices; by increasing ruminal bacteria Papillibacter and Eubacterium_hallii_group, which are involved in butyrate production; and by increasing Synergistetes and Mogibacterium, which are involved in bacterial colonization. In conclusion, chopping roughage at 4 cm was shown to improve the rumen bacterial community, alter rumen fermentation, eventually promote the development of rumen.

AB This study was aimed to estimate the effect of soy lecithin (SL) on growth performance, serum metabolites, rumen fermentation and microbial flora in Simmental steers. Sixty Simmental steers were randomly assigned to four treatments: control (C), S1 (TMR with 10 g/kg (DM) SL), S2 (TMR with 20 g/kg (DM) SL) and S3 (TMR with 40 g/kg (DM) SL).The ADG of steers fed 10 g/kg, 20 g/kg and 40 g/kg SL was 8.6%, 22.5% and 9.4% higher than that control group, respectively (P <0.001), while FCR decreased quadratically (P <0.001) by increasing the SL level, and the lowest FCR was achieved for steers fed 20 g/kg SL. There was a linear decrease in the ruminal pH value yet a quadratic increase in acetate and total VFAs concentration by increasing the SL supplementation (P < 0.001). The serum concentrations of CHO, TG, HDL, FAS and HLS concentrations showed a linear increase by increasing the SL supplementation (P <0.05). The rumen bacterial community of five phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetae and Actinobacteria) and genera (Prevotella, Bacteroidales BS11_gu4 Prevotellaceae UGG-033, Rikenellacese_RC and Coprostanoligenes) that were most abundant in the rumen microbial flora was not affected by SL supplementation (P >0.05), while some ruminal bacterial with lower abundance showed a linear decrease by increasing the SL supplementation. Therefore, SL supplementation improved growth performance and increased ruminal VFA yields of Simmental steers with no inhibitory effect on the dominant ruminal bacterial. Based on the results of growth performance, the recommended amount of SL supplement is 20 g/kg DM for beef steers.

AB Infectious laryngotracheitis disease is an acute, highly contagious viral disease seriously affecting poultry industry worldwide. In this study, a rapid and simple immune colloidal gold test strip for detecting infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) was developed based on membrane chromatography with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against gJ protein of ILTV and systematically evaluated for the detection of ILTV from clinical samples. mAb 2D4 1D7 was conjugated with colloidal gold as the detector antibody on the test strip. Another mAb, 1D8 1G3, was used as the capture complex at the test line (T-line), and goat antimouse IgG antibody was used as the capture antibody at the control line (C-line). The colloidal gold test strip showed high specificity in the detection of ILTV, with no cross-reaction with other avian pathogens, including infectious bronchitis virus, infectious bursal disease virus, avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, fowl adenoviruses, and Marek's disease virus. Besides, the detection limit of this method was as low as 60 ELD50/ mL for the ILTV Wanggang strain. Furthermore, we evaluated its application in 260 clinical samples suspected of infection with ILTV. Results from the strip test were nearly identical with those from real-time PCR (coincidence rate 99.6%) and showed higher sensitivity than conventional PCR. All the results obtained in this study indicated that the colloidal gold test strip can be applied as a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of ILTV, especially in resource-limited areas.

AB This paper studies the containment control problem of linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with a directed graph, where the states of the followers will asymptotically converge to the convex hull formed by those of the leaders. By introducing the functional observer, a novel distributed event-triggered control strategy is presented to schedule communications between agents, which depends on the relative input and output measurements with its neighbors. Furthermore, the minimum inter-event time is guaranteed to be strictly positive. An example is presented to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the theoretic results.

AB Although several physical models have been proposed to interpret the photoluminescence intermittency that hinders the applications of single semiconductor quantum dots, the structure dependence of radiative and nonradiative recombination of excitons remains unclear. In order to address the structure-property correlation of II-VI quantum dots, the variations of radiative and nonradiative decay rate constants, k(r) and k(nr), of (CdSe)(13) clusters with structural descriptors are studied using first-principles calculations together with the semiclassical two-state model. Attributed to their small size and diverse structures, the four isomers of (CdSe)(13) exhibit distinct optical absorption and emission properties. Their k(r) and k(nr) values vary in a wide range, though they have the same cluster size. While a previously suggested correlation between k(r) and electron-hole spatial overlap is verified, dependence of k(nr) on reorganization energy, Huang-Rhys factor, transition energy, etc. is explored. Correlation of k(nr) with Huang-Rhys factor is further analyzed in terms of vibrational modes and cluster shapes. In addition, a descriptor based on chemical softness, Delta s = s(+) - s(-), is proposed, and a good correlation between k(nr) and Delta s is revealed. The revealed structure-dependent radiative and nonradiative electron-hole recombination behaviors would be helpful for understanding and suppressing the photoluminescence intermittency in semiconductor quantum dots.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In instance-based machine learning, algorithms often suffer from prohibitive computational costs and storage space. To overcome such problems, various instance reduction techniques have been developed to remove noises and/or redundant instances. Condensation approach is the most frequently used method, and it aims to remove the instances far away from the decision surface. Edition method is another popular one, and it removes noises to improve the classification accuracy. Drawbacks of these existing techniques include parameter dependency and relatively low accuracy and reduction rate. To solve these drawbacks, the constraint nearest neighbor-based instance reduction (CNNIR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. We firstly introduce the concept of natural neighbor and apply it into instance reduction to eliminate noises and search core instances. Then, we define a constraint nearest neighbor chain which only consists of three instances. It is used to select border instances which can construct a rough decision boundary. After that, a specific strategy is given to reduce the border set. Finally, reduced set is obtained by merging border and core instances. Experimental results show that compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the number of instances and achieves higher classification accuracy. Moreover, it does not require any user-defined parameters.

AB Background and aim: It is commonly noticed that chaotic and inefficient subgenotyping are universally used academically and clinically, a standardized HBV genotype/subgenotype classification criterion is urgently acquired. Sequence similarity, which was commonly used for the last three decades, should be upgraded by phylogenetic analysis in genotyping of recombinant-free HBV strains.
   Methods: In this study, 4,429 HBV whole-genome sequences were employed to reconstruct the phylogeny of HBV using Bayesian inference. After excluding recombinant sequences, calculating partitioned evolutionary models, excluding recombinant sequences, reconstructing phylogenetic trees, and performing a correlation analysis of genetic distances, geographical distribution and serotypes, we systematically redefined the genotypes and subgenotypes of HBV.
   Results: Compared to previous taxonomy, fourteen subgenotypes (A5-A7; B5-B9; C2-C4, C7; and D6-D7) were revised in the new standard. Now the HBV is divided into ten genotypes (A-J) and 24 subgenotypes (A1-A3; B1-B5; C1-C6; D1-D6; and F1-F4).
   Conclusion: Our robust genotype/subgenotype new taxonomy has objectively re-molded the current shape of HBV classification. We believe that all future hepatitis B related researches or diagnosis will be benefited under the new HBV genotyping/subgenotyping standards.

AB This paper proposes a new hybrid frequency control strategy for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) to simultaneously provide short-term and long-term frequency regulation support to the connected power system. The kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass and the mechanical power reserve of the WT are coordinately configured to participate in frequency recovery at both primary and secondary stages. A frequency response model (FRM) is also derived to analyse the mutual interactions between WTs and the power system. Based on the FRM, the impacts of relevant parameter variations on the overall system stability can be investigated through Nyquist criterion and modal analyses and the stable operation range of proposed strategy could be easily identified. Theoretical and numerical results have both verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and its advantages over existing methods.

AB On the basis of three annual waves of data obtained from 268 Chinese couples, we tested an actor-partner interdependence mediation model in which spouses' neuroticism was linked to their own and partners' marital satisfaction through both intrapersonal processes (i.e., marital attribution) and interpersonal processes (i.e., marital aggression). Considering intra- and interpersonal processes simultaneously, four indirect, mediating pathways were identified: Time 1 Wives' Neuroticism -> Time 2 Wives' Attribution or Aggression, while controlling for Time 1 Wives' Attribution or Aggression -> Time 3 Wives' or Husbands' Marital Satisfaction, while controlling for Time 1 Wives' or Husbands' Marital Satisfaction. This study not only adds to a limited body of research examining why neuroticism is associated with conjugal well-being, but also extends prior research by focusing on Chinese couples and utilizing a longitudinal, dyadic mediation model. Such findings have important practical implications. Couples involving neurotic partners may benefit from interventions based on cognitive-behavioral approaches. When working with couples challenged by neuroticism, practitioners need to help them address dysfunctional interactive patterns as well as distorted cognitive styles.

AB In this work, we combined accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) and conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations coupled with the potential of mean force (PMF), correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and protein structure network (PSN) to study the effects of dimerization and the mutations of I52V and V150A on the CCR5 homodimer, in order to elucidate the mechanism regarding cooperativity of the ligand binding between two protomers and to address the controversy about the mutation-induced dimer-separation. The results reveal that the dimer with interface involved in TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4 is stable for the CCR5 homodimer. The dimerization induces an asymmetric impact on the overall structure and the ligand-binding pocket. As a result, the two protomers exhibit an asymmetric binding to the maraviroc (one anti-HIV drug). The binding of one protomer to the drug is enhanced while the other is weakened. The PSN result further reveals the allosteric pathway of the ligand-binding pocket between the two protomers. Six important residues in the pathway were identified, including two residues unreported. The results from PMF, PCA, and the correlation analysis clearly indicate that the two mutations induce strong anticorrelation motions in the interface, finally leading to its separation. The observations from the work could advance our understanding of the structure of the G protein-coupled receptor dimers and implications for their functions.

AB With the shortage of nonrenewable energy, renewable energy resources play an important role in practice. One of the most promising renewable energy is viewed as solar energy resources due to its cleanliness and the inexhaustibility. However, the quantitative assessment method on the reliability of a complicated solar energy generating system has been a considerable challenge. In this paper, we propose a Markov model to imitate a solar energy generating system with inverters in series, unreliable by-pass change-over switches, and common cause failure. Employing the renewal point technique and the Semi-Markov process theory, we build the quantitative reliability models of the system. Further, we develop a new algorithm to obtain the explicit form solution of reliability indices. An example illustrates that the proposed models and the algorithm are efficient and concise.

AB Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive soft materials have attracted considerable concerns over the last decades. In this work, a ROS-responsive vesicle was developed by a simple co-assembly strategy, in which the selenium-containing ionic liquid surfactant, benzylselenide-1-undecyl methylpyrrolidinium bromide (BSeMPB), was used as a ROS-responsive molecule, in combination with the commercially available sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). With the addition of H2O2, or by prolonging the time at 1.0 eq H2O2 with respect to BSeMPB, the vesicles were initially shown to gradually grow. This growth was then followed by a sudden collapse when reaching the concentration of 0.6 eq H2O2 with respect to BSeMPB, or when the equilibrium time was 90 min after the addition of 1.0 eq H2O2. In both cases, this phenomenon was due to the ROS-induced molecular transition from selenide to selenoxide, leading to a transition from vesicle to micelle in microstructure. Such a transition was not only dependent on the ROS concentration, but also on the time, making these nanocarriers ideal candidates for drug delivery applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report herein the design and synthesis of a series of less lipophilic Q203 derivatives containing an alkaline fused ring moiety. Most of them show considerable potency against MTB H37Rv strain (MIC < 0.25 mu M). Nine compounds (13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 29, 35, 36) have the same excellent activity against both drug-sensitive and -resistant strains (MIC < 0.035 mu M) as Q203 and PBTZ169. Especially, compound 29 also displays acceptable safety, greater absorption in plasma and aqueous solubility than Q203, suggesting its promising potential to be lead compound for future antitubercular drug discovery.

AB The toxic effects of lead on human health and the environment have long been a focus of research. To explore sources of lead in Guangzhou, China, we investigated atmospheric lead-containing particles (LCPs) during wintertime using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). Based on mass spectral features, LCPs were classified into eight major particle types, including Pb-Cl and Pb-Cl-Li (coal combustion and waste incineration), Pb-Cl-EC and Pb-Cl-OC (diesel trucks and coal combustion), Pb-Cl-Fe (iron and steel industry), Pb-Cl-AlSi (dust), Pb-Sec (secondary formation), and Pb-Cl-Zn (industrial process); these sources (in parentheses) were identified by comparing atmospheric LCP mass spectra with authentic Pb emission source mass spectra. Sampling periods with LCP number fractions (NFs) more than three times the average LCP NF (APF = 4.35%) and below the APF were defined as high LCP NF periods (HLFPs: H1, H3, and H5) and low LCP NF APF periods (LLFPs: L2 and L4), respectively. Diurnal patterns and high Pb-Sec content during LLFPs indicate that photochemical activity and heterogeneous reactions may have controlled Pb-Sec particle formation. The inverse Pb-Cl and Pb-Sec particle diurnal trends during LLFPs suggest the replacement of Cl by sulfate and nitrate. On average over the five periods, similar to 76% of the LCPs likely arose from coal combustion and/or waste incineration, which were dominant sources during all five periods, followed by diesel trucks during LLFPs and iron- and steel-related sources during HLFPs; HLFP LCPs arose mainly from primary emissions. These results can be used to more efficiently control Pb emission sources and prevent harm to human and environmental health from Pb toxicity.

ID MICRORNA; DIFFERENTIATION; LACTATION
AB microRNA (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA that regulate protein abundance and are involved in diverse aspects of cellular function including aspects of lipid metabolism in mammary gland of ruminants. Although our previous studies showed that the miR-26 family and its host genes control components of the cellular fatty acid metabolic machinery in goat mammary epithelial cells, a direct relationship between the miR-26 family and milk fatty acids remains unknown. Bioinformatics analysis in this study indicated that the miR-26 family targets belong to the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, MAPK signalling pathway, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Studies on the relationship of miR-26 family and their host genes with milk composition during mid-lactation revealed that the expression of the miR-26 family and their host genes were associated with total fat yield and short-chain, medium-chain and long-chain fatty acid content, but not lactose or milk protein content. In addition, a significant positive correlation was detected for the expression of the miR-26 family with C16:1 and C18:3 in milk fat. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the expression of miR-26 is directly related to milk fatty acid composition and underscores the significance of miRNAs in milk fat synthesis regulation.

AB Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA is a central mode of genetic regulation in higher eukaryotes. High-throughput experimental verification of alternative splice forms, functional characterization, and regulation of alternative splicing are key directions for research. However, little information is available on the transcriptome-wide changes during different ages in different chicken breeds. In this study, the sequencing reads of chicken muscle tissues collected from White feather broiler (day 42) and Luning Chicken (day 70, 120, 150) were mapped to the chicken genome. Results showed that a total of 16,958 genes were annotated, with 2230 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when comparing White feather broiler and Luning Chicken, and an average of 700 DEGs when comparing different ages in Liming Chicken. Functional classification by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathways analysis for selecting the genes showed most DEGs were related to muscle development and immune response. Of the 16,958 genes, a total of 6249 genes (36.85%) underwent AS events, and over 40% were specifically expressed in each library. Additionally, 6 DEGs (SRPK3, ENSGALG00000022884, CCL4, GATM, SESN1,PTTG1IP) involved in muscle development and immunity response were found to be alternatively spliced among all the four muscle tissues. In conclusion, we present a complete dataset involving the spatial and temporal transcriptome of chicken muscle tissue using RNA -seq. These data will facilitate the understanding of the effects of breed and age on the development of muscle and uncover that AS events of candidate genes may have important functional roles in regulation of muscle development in chicken.

AB With the quick development of Internet of Things (IoT), one of its important supporting technologies, i.e., wireless sensor networks (WSNs), gets much more attention. Neighbor discovery is an indispensable procedure in WSNs. The existing deterministic neighbor discovery algorithms in WSNs ensure that successful discovery can be obtained within a given period of time, but the average discovery delay is long. It is difficult to meet the need for rapid discovery in mobile low duty cycle environments. In addition, with the rapid development of IoT, the node densities of many WSNs greatly increase. In such scenarios, existing neighbor discovery methods fail to satisfy the requirement in terms of discovery latency under the condition of the same energy consumption. This paper proposes a group-based fast neighbor discovery algorithm (GBFA) to address the issues. By carrying neighbor information in beacon packet, the node knows in advance some potential neighbors. It selects more energy efficient potential neighbors and proactively makes nodes wake up to verify whether these potential neighbors are true neighbors, thereby speeding up neighbor discovery, improving energy utilization efficiency and decreasing network communication load. The evaluation results indicate that, compared with other methods, GBFA decreases the average discovery latency up to at the same energy budget.

AB N,O-Aminals are synthesized through the N-iodosuccinimide-mediated regioselective 1,2-additions of alcohols to allenamides. These novel reactions proceed rapidly and exhibit broad substrate scope for a variety of allenamides. The reaction demonstrates that N-lodosuccinimide is effective in activating the terminal C=C bond of allenamides generating conjugated sulfamide ion species. It is noteworthy that the alcohol served as both solvent and nucleophile in this transformation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element that is required during mammalian developmental processes. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Zn supplementation during in vitro maturation (IVM) on the developmental capacity of yak (Bos grunniens) oocytes. Cumulus expansion, nuclear maturation, intracellular glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, subsequent embryonic development, and the expression of Zn transporters (ZnTs) and Zrt and Irt-like proteins (ZiPs) were evaluated. The Zn concentrations in yak plasma and follicular fluid were 0.740 +/- 0.012 and 0.382 +/- 0.009 mu g/mL, respectively. The cumulus expansion did not show significant differences in COCs after matured with or without Zn supplementation (P > 0.05). The intracellular GSH was higher in oocytes matured with 1 or 2 mg/L Zn than in control group (0 mg/L) (P < 0.05). However, ROS levels of oocytes matured with 1 or 2 mg/L Zn were reduced significantly compared with the control and 0.5 mg/L groups (P < 0.05). The SOD activity was increased significantly after Zn supplementation. The cleavage rate was not significantly different after Zn supplementation (P > 0.05). Percentages of matured oocytes that developed into the blastocyst stage after IVF were 47.9, 50.5, 60.4, and 58.9% for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L Zn groups, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression patterns associated with Zn were changed after Zn supplementation. In conclusion, Zn supplementation to IVM improved yak oocyte maturation and subsequent development by increasing GSH and SOD activity, decreasing ROS in oocytes.

AB Core-shell (C/S) structured upconversion coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are of great interest due to their potential as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and upconversion luminescent (UCL) imaging agents, as well as near-infrared activated photodynamic therapy (PDT) platforms. When C/S structured Fe3O4@Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Er NPs were prepared previously, well-defined C/S-NPs could not be formed without the doping of Mn2+ during synthesis. Here, the role of Mn2+ doping on the synthesis of core-shell structured magnetic-upconversion nanoparticles (MUCNPs) is investigated in detail. Core-shell-shell nanoparticles (C/S/S-MUCNPs) with Fe3O4 as the core, an inert layer of Mn2+-doped NaYF4 and an outer shell consisting of Mn2+-doped NaYF4: Yb/Er were prepared. To further develop C/S/S-MUCNPs applications in the biological field, amphiphilic poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (C18PMH) modified with amine functionalized methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (C18PMH-mPEG) was used as a capping ligand to modify the surface of C/S/S-MUCNPs to improve biocompatibility. UCL imaging, T-1-weighted MRI ascribed to the Mn2+ ions and T-2-weighted MRI ascribed to the Fe3O4 core of C/S/S-MUCNPs were then evaluated. Finally, chlorine e6 (Ce6) was loaded on the C/S/S-MUCNPs and the PDT performance of these NPs was explored. Mn2+ doping is an effective method to control the formation of core-shell structured MUCNPs, which would be potential candidate as multifunctional nanoprobes for future T-1/T-2-weighted MR/UCL imaging and PDT platforms.

AB Squaraine core based small molecules in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells have received extensive attentions due to their distinguished photochemical properties in far red and infrared domain. In this paper, combining theoretical simulations and experimental syntheses and characterizations, three major factors (fill factor, short circuit and open-cirvuit voltage) have been carried out together to achieve improvement of power conversion efficiencies of solar cells. As model material systems with D-A-D" framework, two asymmetric squaraines (CNSQ and CCSQ-Tol) as donor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cell were synthesized and characterized. Intensive density functional theory computations were applied to identify some direct connections between three factors and corresponding molecular structural properties. It then helps us to predict one new molecule of CCSQ'-Ox that matches all the requirements to improve the power conversion efficiency.

AB To investigate canine kobuvirus (CaKoV) infection in southwest China, 107 fecal samples were collected from dogs with obvious diarrhea in Sichuan and Chongqing regions, China. CaKoV infection was detected in 54 diarrheic samples (50.46%) by RT-PCR targeting a partial fragment (504 bp) of the 3D gene. Comparison of these partial 3D gene sequences from 14 of these CaKoV-positive samples show 95.4%-99.0% nucleotide (nt) identity within this group, and nt identities ranging from 93.1% to 98.2% with previously reported CaKoV 3D gene sequences. Additionally, we amplified five VP1 gene sequences and analyzed the inferred phylogeny. Amino acid (aa) identities of the five VP1 gene sequences were 81.5%-89.4% with those previously reported. Furthermore, one complete CaKoV genome was successfully obtained from a positive sample and designated SMCD-59/CHN/2015.

AB The carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) and its homologs play an important role in coordinating the expression of bacterial virulence factors required for successful host infection. In addition, bacterial pathogens with deficiency of CsrA are typically attenuated for virulence. In 2016, the first series of small-molecule inhibitors of CsrA-RNA interaction were identified, which were found to achieve the CsrA-RNA inhibition by binding to the CsrA, without interfering with the RNA. However, the binding mechanism of these inhibitors of CsrA is not known. Herein, we applied molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations to investigate the binding mode of inhibitors to CsrA. We found that the G(11)(RNA)-binding site is the most important binding site for CsrA inhibitors. An inhibitor with the proper size range can bind to that site and form a stable complex. We also found that inhibitors with larger size ranges bind to the entire CsrA-RNA interface, but have loose binding. However, this loose binding still resulted in inhibitory activity. The calculated binding free energy from MM/GBSA has a good correlation with the derived experimental binding energy, which might be used as a tool to further select CsrA inhibitors after a first-round of high-throughput virtual screening.

AB A N-1-selective alkenylation of 1-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with alkynes via gold catalysis is reported. N-1-Vinyl substituted 1,2,3-tria-zoles were selectively prepared in up to 92% yield through the sulfonyl group of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives transformed to alkenyl groups in a "one-pot two steps" manner. This method provided a new method for the synthesis of potentially biological-active vinyl-triazole building blocks.

AB Erigeron multiradiatus (Lindl.) Benth. has been used in Tibet folk medicine to treat various inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate antimyocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury effect of caffeoylquinic acids derivatives of E. multiradiatus (AE) in vivo and to explain underling mechanism. AE was prepared using the whole plant of E. multiradiatus and contents of 6 caffeoylquinic acids determined through HPLC analysis. Myocardial I/R was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 30 minutes followed by 24 hours of reperfusion in rats. AE administration (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) inhibited I/R-induced injury as indicated by decreasing myocardial infarct size, reducing of CK and LDH activities, and preventing ST-segment depression in dose-dependent manner. AE decreased cardiac tissue levels of proinflammatory factors TNF-alpha and IL-6 and attenuated leukocytes infiltration. AE was further demonstrated to significantly inhibit I-kappa B degradation, nuclear translocation of p-65 and phosphorylation of JNK. Our results suggested that cardioprotective effect of AE could be due to suppressing myocardial inflammatory response and blocking NF-kappa B and JNK activation pathway. Thus, caffeoylquinic acids might be the active compounds in E. multiradiatus on myocardial ischemia and be a potential natural drug for treating myocardial I/R injury.

AB The effect of types of CNTs (pristine and hydroxylated) on the synthesis of Chitosan-CNT (CS-CNT) composites was investigated theoretically. The adsorption energy (E-ads) of CS on the pristine CNT and hydroxylated CNTs (CNT-OHn, n=1-6) as well as the structural and electronic properties of said composites have been investigated. Results show that the adsorption of CS on CNT and CNT-OHn, is thermodynamically favored. The E-ads of CS on CNTs was calculated to be -20.387 kcal/mol from electrostatic interactions. For CS adsorbed into CNT-OHn, E-ads ranges from -20.612 to -37.567 kcal/mol. Hydroxyl groups on CNT are the main adsorption sites for CS loading onto CNT-OHn. via hydrogen-bond interactions. The CS-CNT-OH3 is the most sable composite among tested complexes. The energy gap (Delta E-gap) of CS-CNT-OH3 was calculated less than pristine CNT and CNT-OH3, indicative of the composites being more reactive than that of pristine CNTs and CNT-OH3. It was proved that CS can transfer electron to the hydroxylated CNTs, thus overcoming the drawbacks of CNTs being chemically inert. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Epidermal growth factor (EGF) ameliorates stress and prevents incomplete gastrointestinal development in early-weaned piglets in commercial swine farming. This study aimed to further analyze the biological activities of intracellularly expressed EGF (IE-EGF), extracellularly expressed EGF (EE-EGF), and tagged EGF (T-EGF) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in early-weaned pigs. In this study, we assigned 24 pigs to each of 5 groups that were provided a basic diet (the control group) or a diet supplemented with empty vector-expressing S. cerevisiae [the INVSc1(EV) group], T-EGF-expressing S. cerevisiae [the INVSc1-TE(-) group], EE-EGF-expressing S. cerevisiae [the INVSc1-EE(+) group], or IE-EGF-expressing S. cerevisiae [the INVSc1-IE(+) group]. All treatments were delivered at a dose of 60 mu g EGF/kg body weight (BW) everyday. All the piglets were sacrificed after 21 day to determine their physio-biochemical indexes, immune functions, and intestinal development. In the piglet experiments, recombinant S. cerevisiae survived throughout the intestinal tract. The BW and intestinal development (e.g., mean villous height, crypt depth, villous height:crypt depth ratio (IVR), and total protein, DNA, and RNA contents) of the piglets were significantly enhanced in the INVSc1-IE(+) group compared with the animals in the INVSc1-EE(+) and INVSc1-TE(-) groups (P < 0.05). In addition, increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining was observed in the piglets that received the INVSc1-IE(+) treatment (approximately 80 %) compared with those that received the INVSc1-TE(-) (approximately 70 %) and INVSc1-EE(+) treatments (approximately 70 %). The levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were also significantly increased in the INVSc1-IE(+) group compared with the INVSc1-EE(+) and INVSc1-TE(-) groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the proliferation of piglet enterocytes was also significantly stimulated by both IE-EGF and EE-EGF compared with T-EGF in vitro (P < 0.05). Our data further demonstrate the previously reported hypothesis that IE-EGF is more suitable than EE-EGF or T-EGF for applications in early-weaned pigs.

AB The application of ionic liquids (ILs) and macroporous resins for systematic separation of flavonoids and anthocyanins from Chinese sugarcane (Saccharum sinensis Roxb.) has been studied. The results show that the 0.8M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate aqueous solution ([C4MIM] [PF6]-water) has the highest yield among all the ILs and sugarcane tip is found with highest antioxidant bioactivity. D141 resin has the best adsorption and desorption performance for flavonoids and anthocyanins. And the pseudo-first-order kinetics model is the most favorable tool for illustrating the whole adsorption process. Furthermore, the equilibrium experimental data are well-fitted to the Langmuir isotherms. The values of triangle H, triangle G and triangle S suggest that the adsorption process is exothermic and the main driving force is hydrophobic interaction. Dynamic adsorption and desorption experiments prove that the flavonoids and anthocyanins can be completely eluted with the ethanol-water (70:30, v/v) of 5 BV and lower flow rate is more benefit to desorption process.

AB Staphylococcus aureus is a major foodborne pathogen. The primary purpose of this research was to evaluate S. aureus contamination levels and distribution characteristics in various kinds of food. A total of 121 samples of 11 kinds of food were collected from different food markets in the summer season according to their availability and popularity, and 103 (85.1 %) samples were found to be contaminated with S. aureus. Raw meat, meat products, soybean products, and pickled vegetables are highly contaminated food. For enterotoxin genes analysis, among all the isolates, 20 (19.4 %) possessed sea gene, 2 (1.9 %) with sed gene, 8 (7.8 %) with seg gene, 4 (3.8 %) with seh gene, 24 (23.3 %) with sei gene, 5 (4.8 %) with selj gene, 24 (23.3 %) with selk gene, 44 (42.7 %) with seln gene, and 8 (7.8 %) with ser gene. The seb, sec, see, selm, and selu genes were not found in any of the isolates. For the antibiotic resistance genes tests, most isolates from the food samples were positive for at least 1 of 6 antibiotic resistance genes. The most prevalent resistance genes in samples were ermA (85/103, 82.5 %), followed by tetA (61/103, 59.2 %), chlA (60/103, 58.2 %), norA (56/103, 54.3 %), mecA (10/103, 9.7 %), and blaZ (7/103, 6.8 %). Our results showed that most isolates harbored enterotoxins-producing genes and antibiotic resistance genes, indicating the risk of foodborne S. aureus outbreaks, which drew urgent attention to the great need to improve hygienic conditions in food processing, in order to enhance the safety of food products.

AB Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) is an environmentally-friendly and sustainable approach to seawater desalination and offers a promising solution for addressing water scarcity challenge. However, the intricate nature of SIE technology as a complex three-phase system calls for more holistic design strategies. Therefore, we present a comprehensive optimization strategy that integrates various design concepts spanning from optical characteristics and thermal localization enhancement to thermal convection intensification. The enhancement of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect is initially demonstrated by uniformly introducing TiNNH2 nanoparticles onto the SWCNTs-COOH surface, showcasing remarkable absorbance properties (95.49%). Subsequently, the integration of a dual-network hydrogel is utilized to create a Janus architecture, which can enhance the thermal localization effect with an impressive evaporative efficiency of 92.25%. Finally, perforations are introduced to further improve heat convection, resulting in an exceptional evaporation rate of TiN@CNT/GOF-H1 (3.33 kg m(- 2) h(- 1), when calculated according to the real area, the evaporation rate value is 3.75 kg m(- 2) h(- 1)). Both experimental findings and numerical simulations underscores the efficacy of this multiple-optimization engineered design. Experiment conducted within a customized device has substantiated the enduring cyclic stability and pH resistance to variations, potentially facilitating the spread of practical applications. The integration of multiple optimization strategies is expected to provide valuable insights for the holistic performance enhancement of the SIE evaporators.

AB As urbanization accelerates and global warming intensifies, urban heat risks are increasingly becoming a critical issue and addressing this challenge to foster more harmonious and livable urban environments is essential. In our study, multisource remote sensing and point-of-interest (POI) data were applied to assess the urban heat risks in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration from 2001 to 2020. The results indicated that the heat hazard, exposure, and sensitivity were notably greater in the southeastern of the BTH. Conversely, the heat adaptability was lower in the southeast, leading to a severe high heat risk in this region. From 2001 to 2020, the heat risk index (HRI) values for these cities generally displayed an upward trend, peaking in 2015. Among the cities, Handan had the highest heat risk, followed by Baoding and Beijing, with HRIs of 0.32, 0.32, and 0.31, respectively. In urban areas, commercial zones had the highest average HRI at 0.3, while public management zones had the lowest at 0.28. These findings highlight significant variations in heat risk, indicating the need for targeted urban planning and heat mitigation strategies in the most affected areas of the BTH.

ID PROTOCOL
AB Due to the increasing demand for oceanic exploration, routing algorithms in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have garnered widespread research interest. However, the majority of current routing algorithms only use a single transmission medium and consider the information from merely one or two hops when selecting relay nodes, thereby attaining limited achievement of globally optimal path selection. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a routing algorithm for underwater acoustic-optical hybrid wireless sensor networks based on intelligent ant colony optimization and energy-flexible (IAEF) global optimal path selection. Given the diverse energy-consumption characteristics of acoustic and optical waves, the proposed IAEF algorithm uses acoustic waves in seeking optimal path and optical waves in delivering data packets. In contrast to other routing algorithms based on ant colony techniques, the proposed IAEF algorithm enables source nodes to select the optimal path for data transmission with the heuristic factor updated according to a comprehensive consideration on remained energy and transmission deviation angle. Considering the limited energy in networks, the proposed IAEF algorithm designs an energy classification network update mechanism with flexible cycles, which enables network updates according to an adjustable energy threshold for the nodes along the optimal path. In addition, a protection period is implemented to prevent excessive network updates to improve packet delivery rate (PDR) and network lifetime. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed IAEF algorithm can obtain up to about 37% and 78% improvements in PDR and network lifetime when compared with the classical routing algorithms adopted in the simulations.

AB Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are useful nanomaterials of excellent water solubility, biocompatibility and optical stability for various applications. In this study, we achieved the nitrogen fixation activity enhancement of autogenous azotobacters (Azotobacter vinelandii) by GQDs and revealed its mechanism. GQDs (1-10 mg/L) accelerated the logarithmic growth phase of A. vinelandii, making bacteria enter the plateau earlier. Biocompatible GQDs did not cause cell death and oxidative damage of A. vinelandii. The expression levels of metabolism and nitrogen fixation related genes were significantly up-regulated by GQDs, thereby enhancing the activity of nitrogenase. The nitrogen fixation activity of A. vinelandii reached 471.7 % of the control upon the exposure to GQDs. The intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate vesicles were consumed to provide energy for nitrogen fixation, which involved with a chain reaction of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy metabolism pathways accompanied by significant increases in electron transfer rate. The synergistic effect of GQDs on A. vinelandii further facilitated the augmentation of soil nitrogen content in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results provided an effective approach to enhance the biological nitrogen fixation by GQDs.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB Anomaly detection is an important field in data science that has been widely researched and applied, generating many methods. Among these methods, the isolation forest algorithm is outstanding because of its efficiency and effectiveness, especially in regard to large-scale data. Unfortunately, this algorithm has some drawbacks, such as being unable to effectively handle local outliers, possibly leading to normal data masking the detection of outliers due to space partitioning along the coordinate axes, and low utilization of training data. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an improved isolation forest algorithm based on multilayer subspace dividing, named layered isolation forest, which adapts to the different distributions of the dataset by dividing the sample space into subspaces and evaluating the anomaly degree of data in different spatial ranges. This algorithm obtains a more accurate and reasonable anomaly score, avoids the problems of the original algorithm, and improves the performance metrics. According to the experimental results, the proposed method maintains the efficiency of the original algorithm and exhibits the best comprehensive performance compared with similar algorithms on artificial synthetic datasets and real -world datasets from multiple domains.

AB Strengthening and optimizing the spatial structure and functional connectivity of green space ecological networks can not only relieve the tight urban space and provide biodiversity protection but also promote the virtuous cycle of the urban ecosystem and provide a new method for the resilient development of the urban landscape. In this study, the central area of Chengdu was taken as the study area; Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) with landscape metrics were combined to determine the optimal distance threshold and identify the ecological sources. Graph theory and circuit theory were applied to construct and optimize the green space ecological network with structural or functional connectivity, respectively. Based on the coupling effect, the optimization of the ecological network was put forward, and the network analysis method was used to evaluate the connectivity of three different types of ecological networks. The results were as follows: (1) The ecological network with structural connectivity was composed of 74 stepping stones, 43 protective sources, and 315 ecological corridors. The connectivity of green space structures gradually decreased from west to east and from periphery to center. (2) In the optimal ecological network with functional connectivity, 176 important ecological corridors were protected, and 40 pinch points and 48 protective sources were identified. The number of important corridors in the east and south was the largest, and the network structure was relatively complex. The barriers were divided into three different levels of ecological restoration areas. (3) The green ecological network with structural and functional connectivity has the best network connectivity. A green space ring network optimization pattern of one center, two belts, multi-points, multi-corridors, and multi-zones connected in a series was proposed. It was suggested to build a multi-level forest ecosystem in Longquan Mountain, develop eco-fruit agriculture and eco-tourism, enrich the biodiversity of the ecological source, and improve its anti-interference ability to the external environment. It is also important to increase ecological strategic points and stepping stones to strengthen the links between different ecological restoration areas, properly handle the use of cultivated land in different regions, strictly observe the red line of cultivated land, and maintain the integrity and diversity of ecological sources. Therefore, the optimization method of the green space ecological network in this study provides technical support for the effective determination of ecological protection areas, the accurate implementation of green space ecological networks, and a scientific planning strategy for decision-makers.

AB An electro-Fenton coupled membrane filtration system (abbreviated as EF-MF system) was constructed for the efficient removal of bisphenol A (abbreviated as BPA, a kind of pharmaceuticals and personal care products, abbreviated as PPCPs). In the EF-MF system, a porous Fe3O4/FeO/Fe@C catalyst was synthesized and applied to enhance the electro-Fenton reaction, and polyvinylidene fluoride/carbon fiber cloth composite cathode membrane was used as both cathode electrode and membrane. Characterization results indicated the porous Fe3O4/ FeO/Fe@C catalyst exhibited micron-level rod morphology and was in an encapsulated structure with Fe3O4/ FeO/Fe composite nanoparticles covered by porous graphitic carbon. Degradation experiments indicated the EFMF system exhibited great removal efficiency (approximately 96.97%) towards BPA within 70 min in the conditions of catalyst dosing at 0.500 g.L- 1, the value of pH at 3 and the current density at 0.67 mA cm-2. Quenching experiments verified both center dot OH radical and center dot O2- radical played significant roles in the decomposition of BPA. The mass formation of reactive oxygen radicals was mostly owing to the easy access of H2O2 to the activated sites of the porous Fe3O4/FeO/Fe@C catalyst through the porous structure and the rapid cycle conversion between zero-valent iron (ZVI), Fe(II) and Fe(III). Based on the results of intermediates identification, three possible decomposition pathways were presented. Toxicity analysis exhibited most of the intermediates were in less toxicity than BPA. Moreover, the EF-MF system exhibited good stability after four-cyclic utilization. This work provides an efficient and energy-saving strategy for the removal of PPCPs.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe morbidity and mortality among newborn piglets. It significantly threatens the porcine industry in China and around the globe. To accelerate the developmental pace of drugs or vaccines against PEDV, a deeper understanding of the interaction between viral proteins and host factors is crucial. The RNAbinding protein, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), is crucial for controlling RNA metabolism and biological processes. The present work focused on exploring the effect of PTBP1 on PEDV replication. PTBP1 was upregulated during PEDV infection. The PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein was degraded through the autophagic and proteasomal degradation pathways. Moreover, PTBP1 recruits MARCH8 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and NDP52 (a cargo receptor) for N protein catalysis and degradation through selective autophagy. Furthermore, PTBP1 induces the host innate antiviral response via upregulating the expression of MyD88, which then regulates TNF receptor- associated factor 3/ TNF receptor-associated factor 6 expression and induces the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IFN regulatory factor 3. These processes activate the type I IFN signaling pathway to antagonize PEDV replication. Collectively, this work illustrates a new mechanism related to PTBP1-induced viral restriction, where PTBP1 degrades the viral N protein and induces type I IFN production to suppress PEDV replication.

AB The Northeast Farming-pastoral ecotone (NFPE) in China is crucial for farming and pastoralism. However, sustainable development of land resources faces several challenges from human activities and environmental degradation. Thus, assessing land resource-carrying capacity (LRCC) is crucial for effective land-use planning and management. This study proposes a comprehensive indicator system to evaluate LRCC in the NFPE. We integrate remote sensing, model simulation, and statistical data, employing Geographic Information System analysis and statistical techniques to assess spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of LRCC. Findings indicate increasing LRCC with spatial-temporal heterogeneity. The northern region exhibits relatively high and growing LRCC, while some eastern regions have low LRCC but a high growth trend. The southern region displays both low LRCC and growth. Balancing regional development and ecological protection requires considering spatial heterogeneity of LRCC in land-use planning and management decisions, facilitating differentiated land-use strategies for sustainable development.

AB Graphene oxide (abbreviated as GO)-based membranes have shown tremendous potential for desalination. Nevertheless, it is still a major challenge to adjust the interlayer spacing of GO nanosheets and suppress their swelling in aqueous solution to achieve excellent separation properties. Herein, using ceramic membrane as substrate, thiosemicarbazide (TSC) was creatively used to cross-link with GO to tune the interlayer spacing of GO nanosheets. Through vacuum filtration, the GO-TSC modified membrane (abbreviated as GO-TSC membrane) was prepared and was subsequently used for pervaporation (PV) desalination. Results indicated the GO-TSC membrane exhibited a robust structure and presented great desalination performance with the water flux of 6.01 L/(m(2)center dot h) and the corresponding salt rejection of over 99.90 % towards 3.5 wt % sodium chloride aqueous solution at 60.C. This work provides a novel strategy in the way of preparing GO-based membranes for PV desalination.

AB Compared to a voltage source inverter (VSI), a current source inverter (CSI) retains the advantages of inherent boost capacity, friendly output voltage waveforms, and high reliability in motor drive systems. As the motor drive usually operates on variable speed and torque occasions, the CSI needs a prestage circuit and control scheme to generate a proper dc-link current. Because the dc-link current minimization can reduce the losses of semiconductor devices and the total harmonic distortion (THD) of stator current, a dc-link current minimization scheme for CSI-fed induction motor (IM) drive system fed by bidirectional dc chopper-based CSI is proposed in this article. First, the calculation method for the reference of the minimum dc-link current and the optimal exciting component of stator current is derived. Second, the hysteresis control scheme based on the bidirectional dc chopper is designed to regulate the dc-link current tracking to the reference under different operation modes. Third, the influence of the parameters mismatch in the steady state is discussed. Finally, the correctness and feasibility of the dc-link current minimization scheme proposed in this article are verified by simulation and experimental results.

AB The sustainable and environmentally-benign nature of geothermal energy motivates the current investigation to design a cogeneration of power and cooling system. The designed system consists of a double-flash binary system with an organic Rankine cycle and ejector refrigeration cycle integration as the waste heat recovery system. The subsystem's performance is enhanced through the zeotropic working fluid implementation. The energy, exergy, and exergo-economic assessments were utilized to compare two zeotropic mixtures' performances and select an appropriate working fluid. This comparison is carried out by comprehensive sensitivity analysis to study their performance under variable operational conditions. The results reveal that the Pentane-Isohexane has higher performance leading to 1.9 MW of net power and 290.15 kW of cooling load generation. Hence, the total exergetic efficiency and payback period are obtained to be 58.33% and 6.70 years. Considering the energy/ economic optimization scenario enhances the cooling load generation to 574 kW and reduces the net power to 1.85 kW, while the exergy/economic scenario increases the net power production to 1.99 MW and declines the cooling load. By considering the overall performance indexes, the exergy/economic scenario with 6.56 years payback period provides a higher performance and the best optimization scenario.

AB Over the past 40 years, the climate has been changing and human disturbance has increased in the vast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). These 2 factors are expected to affect the distribution of a large number of endemic vertebrate species. However, quantitative relationships between range shifts and climate change and human disturbance of these species in the QTP have rarely been evaluated. We used occurrence records of 19 terrestrial vertebrate species (birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles) occurring in the QTP from 1980 to 2020 to quantify the effects of climate change and anthropogenic impacts on the distribution of these 4 taxonomic groups and estimated species range changes in each species. The trend in distribution changes differed among the taxonomic groups, although, generally, ranges shifted to central QTP. Climate change contributed more to range variation than human disturbance (the sum of the 4 climatic variables contributed more than the sum of the 4 human disturbance variables for all 4 taxonomic groups). Suitable geographic range increased for most mammals, amphibians, and reptiles (+27.6%, +18.4%, and +27.8% on average, respectively), whereas for birds range decreased on average by 0.9%. Quantitative evidence for climate change and human disturbance associations with range changes for endemic vertebrate species in the QTP can provide useful insights into biodiversity conservation under changing environments.

AB Total flavonoids from Smilax glabra (TFSG) exhibit several biological activities; however, their poor stability limits their application. In this work, zein-lecithin-TFSG complex nanoparticles (Z-L-TFSG NPs) were prepared using the anti-solvent coprecipitation technique. The prepared Z-L-TFSG NPs were spherical with an encapsulation efficiency of 98.0%. Differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and morphology tests revealed that the TFSG were successfully encapsulated by Z-L NPs. Z-L-TFSG NPs showed superior stability and better controlled release characteristics in simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The encapsulation of TFSG by Z-L NPs could improve their antioxidant capacity in vitro. Moreover, Z-L-TFSG NPs could enhance the protective effects of TFSG against H2O2-induced oxidative damage to HepG2 cells. The results indicated that the Z-L self-assembled NPs could serve as a promising drug delivery system through the integrated encapsulation of multiple flavonoids.

   sub-pixel convolution; semantic segmentation
AB Semantic segmentation is an active research area for high-resolution (HR) remote sensing image processing. Most existing algorithms are better at segmenting different features. However, for complex scenes, many algorithms have insufficient segmentation accuracy. In this study, we propose a new method CM-Unet based on the U-Net framework to address the problems of holes, omissions, and fuzzy edge segmentation. First, we add the channel attention mechanism in the encoding network and the residual module to transmit information. Second, a multi-feature fusion mechanism is proposed in the decoding network, and an improved sub-pixel convolution method replaces the traditional upsampling operation. We conducted simulation experiments on the Potsdam, Vaihingen and GID datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed CM-Unet required segmentation time is approximately 62 ms/piece, the MIoU is 90.4% and the floating point operations (FLOPs) is 20.95 MFLOPs. Compared with U-Net, CM-Unet only increased the total number of parameters and floating point operations slightly, but achieved the best segmentation effect compared with the other models. CM-Unet can segment remote sensing images efficiently and accurately owing to its lower time consumption and space requirements; the precision of the segmentation results is better than other methods.

AB Aim: Comprehensive biodiversity protection necessitates the consideration of multiple indexes of diversity, and how the distribution patterns of priority areas may shift under climate change. Galliformes is a globally endangered avian order vulnerable to climate change that provide an important indicator for wildlife conservation effectiveness. Here, we identified priority areas for conserving Galliformes taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity in China and their spatial dynamics subject to climate change, and examined how well existing protected areas align with current and future priority areas.Location: China.Methods: We applied species distribution modelling and Zonation algorithms to identify conservation priority area dynamics for 47 galliform species across three biodiversity indexes subject to three future climate change scenarios to 2050s and 2070s. We overlaid these identified priority areas onto existing national nature reserves and national parks to assess and project their effectiveness.Results: Current priority areas proved spatially incongruent between indexes, with an optimal area overlap comprising just 10.3% of China's land area, lying largely outside of existing protected areas. Furthermore, over 80% of modelled optimal priority areas currently lacked formal conservation status. Future priority areas will shift substantially under climate change, to an extent dependent on greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Nevertheless, we identified five large regions where optimal Galliformes diversity indexes should remain stable under all scenarios, thus providing potential climatic refugia, if protected from human encroachment.Main Conclusions: The current deficits we identified for Galliformes protection in China resonate with a broader need for hierarchical conservation strategic planning across regions and ecosystems to ensure long-term biodiversity protection, accommodating for climate change.

AB IntroductionThe alpine meadows are distributed widely and play a vital role in ecosystem service functions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Under the combined effect of climate change and overgrazing, shrubs display an apparent expansion trend, leading to the shrinking of alpine meadows, and directly affecting the structure and function of grassland ecosystems. However, the effects of shrub encroachment on the plant community and soil nutrients of alpine grassland ecosystems still need to be clarified. MethodWe aimed to determine differences in vegetation characteristics and nutrient distribution along the soil profile between shrub patches and their adjacent grassland at three sites, which were three typical types of shrub-encroached grassland, including Spiraea alpina Pall. (SA), Lonicera tubuliflora Rehd. (LT), and Salix cupularis Rehd. (ST). ResultsThe results showed that shrub invasion changed the plant community structure of alpine grassland ecosystems, and shrub type was the critical factor driving this alteration. The expansion of the three shrubs reduced grassland species diversity. Shrub encroachment in SA positively impacted vegetation biomass but significantly decreased the soil organic content (SOC) and total nutrients. Shrub invasion in the ST had the most substantial impact on vegetation and soil, resulting in significantly lower nutrient content in shrubs than in grassland patches. The effect of LT was a significant reduction in vegetation biomass but no significant changes in biodiversity or soil nutrients. Grassland patches were more strongly correlated than shrub patches for SA and LT, while the opposite was true for ST. Vegetation characteristics were correlated least with soil nutrients for SA, while ST was most correlated, and LT was between them. Soil nutrients show more positive correlations with vegetation, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass in deeper soils (20-100 cm) than in shallow soils (0-20 cm). The deeper the soil layer is, the more significant the positive correlations in the shrub patches. Our findings indicated that shrubs play critical roles in the dynamics of vegetation patterns and soil environments for managing and sustainable utilization of shrubby alpine grasslands.

This article will thoroughly discuss the differences between ADHD, BP, and SCHZ (31 healthy control and 31 ADHD; 34 healthy control and 34 BP; 42 healthy control and 42 SCHZ) relative to healthy subjects in combination with three atlases (et al., the Brainnetome atlas, the Dosenbach atlas, the Power atlas) and seven entropies (et al., approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SaEn), permutation entropy (PeEn), fuzzy entropy (FuEn), differential entropy (DiffEn), range entropy (RaEn), and dispersion entropy (DispEn)), as well as the prominent significant brain regions, in the hope of giving information that is more suitable for analyzing different diseases' entropy. First, the reliability (et al., intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) of seven kinds of entropy is calculated and analyzed by using the MSC dataset (10 subjects and 100 sessions in total) and simulation data; then, seven types of entropy and multiscale entropy expanded based on seven kinds of entropy are used to explore the differences and brain regions of ADHD, BP, and SCHZ relative to healthy subjects; and finally, by verifying the classification performance of the seven information entropies on ADHD, BP, and SCHZ, the effectiveness of the seven entropy methods is evaluated through these three methods. The core brain regions that affect the classification are given, and DiffEn performed best on ADHD, SaEn for BP, and RaEn for SCHZ.

AB Currently, magnetic technology and green solvents are widely used in chemical engineering, environmental engineering and other fields as they are environmentally friendly, easy to operate and highly efficient. Moreover, a magnetic field has positive effect on many physicochemical processes. However, related new methods, materials, strategies and applications in separation science still need to be developed. In this review, a series of meaningful explorations of magnetic technologies for the separation of natural products and biologic objects, including magnetic ionic liquids and other magnetic solvents and fluids, magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields, and the development of magnetic separators were reviewed. Furthermore, the difficulties in the application and development of magnetic separation technology were discussed on the basis of comparison and data analysis, especially for the selection of magnetic materials and magnetic field sources. Finally, the progress in the development of magnetic separators was also elaborated for researchers, mainly including that of the new high-efficiency magnetic separator through multi-technology integration and the optimization of traditional magnetic separators, which help current techniques break through their bottleneck as a powerful driving force.

AB The root of Millettia speciosa Champ. (MSCP) is used in folk medicine and is popular as a soup ingredient. The root is composed of the rhizome and radix, but only the radix has been used as a food. Thus, it is very important to compare the chemical components and antioxidant activities between the rhizome and radix. The extracts were analyzed by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS and multivariate analysis, and the antioxidant activities were evaluated by 2,20-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays. Ninety-one compounds were detected simultaneously and temporarily identified. Ten compounds were identified as chemical markers to distinguish the rhizome from the radix. The antioxidant activities of the radix were higher than the rhizome. Correlation analysis showed that uvaol-3-caffeate, 3-O-caffeoyloleanolic acid, and khrinone E were the main active markers for antioxidant activity, which allowed for the rapid differentiation of rhizomes and the radix. Therefore, it could be helpful for future exploration of its material base and bioactive mechanism. In addition, it would be considered to be used as a new method for the quality control of M. speciosa.

AB As a promising alternative to Pd and Pt catalysts, Rh has been found to be an effective catalyst for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). However, Rh-based catalysts can only show a limited EOR mass activity, making them impractical for Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells (DEFCs). Thus, well-designed composites of RhBi alloy and freestanding surface Bi2O3 (RhBi-Bi2O3) are prepared, directed by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to achieve two effects simultaneously as follows: weakening the surface adsorption of poisonous intermediates by Bi addition to downshift the d-band center of Rh, and enriching the supply of oxygenated species by freestanding surface Bi2O3 species. Indeed, the optimal RhBi-Bi2O3 catalysts show superior EOR mass activity of up to ca. 5000 mA mg(-1) Rh, which is ca. 80 times and 2.5 times higher than that of pristine Rh and commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. Meanwhile, it also exhibits long-term durability, ca. 53.7% of faradaic current remains even after a 10 000 second-long measurement. This work might offer new opportunities for the design of EOR electrocatalysts.

AB The treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections attributed to the overuse of antibiotics still remains a serious challenge globally. Herein, zwitterionic charge switchable meso-silica/polypeptide hybrid nanoparticles (MSPNs) were prepared for the synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections. Subsequently, azithromycin (AZT) and methylene blue (MB) were loaded in the MSPNs to form the combined chemo-photodynamic therapeutic nanoparticles (MSPNs-AZT/MB) for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Remarkably, the as-prepared MSPNs-AZT/MB exhibited a negative surface charge of-5.2 mV at physiological pH while switching into positive surface charge of 24.7 mv in an acidic environment, leading to enhanced binding with bacterial surface. The lipase-triggered AZT release up to 77.9 % was achieved, and the loaded MB demonstrated efficient singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation for photodynamic therapy. The in vitro experimental results displayed an excellent antibacterial effect against MRSA in both planktonic and biofilm phenotypes. Additionally, the as-prepared MSPNs-AZT/MB exhibited synergistic and enhanced antibacterial infection effect up to 94 % comparing to monotherapy in a mice model. Considering the above advantages, the as-prepared combined chemo-photodynamic therapeutic nanoparticles showed promising biocompatibility and clinical potential for the efficient therapy of drug-resistant bacteria.

AB The influences of three wheat gluten peptides (WGP-LL, WGP-LML, and WGP-LLL) on the osmotic stress tolerance and membrane lipid component in brewer's yeast were investigated. The results demonstrated that the growth and survival of yeast under osmotic stress were enhanced by WGP supplementation. The addition of WGP upregulated the expressions of OLE1 (encoded the delta-9 fatty acid desaturase) and ERG] (encoded squalene epoxidase) genes under osmotic stress. At the same time, WGP addition enhanced palmitoleic acid (C16:1) content, unsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids ratio, and the amount of ergosterol in yeast cells under osmotic stress. Furthermore, yeast cells in WGP-LL and WGP-LLL groups were more resistant to osmotic stress. WGP-LL and WGP-LLL addition caused 25.08% and 27.02% increase in membrane fluidity, 22.36% and 29.54% reduction in membrane permeability, 18.38% and 14.26% rise in membrane integrity in yeast cells, respectively. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the addition of WGP was capable of maintaining yeast cell morphology and reducing cell membrane damage under osmotic stress. Thus, alteration of membrane lipid component by WGP was an effective approach for increasing the growth and survival of yeast cells under osmotic stress.

AB Many studies have investigated the molecular crosstalk between mastitis-pathogens and cows by either miRNA or mRNA profiles. Here, we employed both miRNA and mRNA profiles to understand the mechanisms of the response of bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by RNA-Seq. The total expression level of miRNAs increased while mRNAs reduced after LPS treatment. About 41 differentially expressed mRNAs and 45 differentially expressed miRNAs involved in inflammation were screened out. We found the NF kappa B-dependent chemokine, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6, IL8, and CX3CL1 to be strongly induced. The anti-apoptosis was active because BCL2A1 and BIRC3 significantly increased with a higher expression. The effects of anti-microbe and inflammation were weakly activated because TNF, IL1, CCL20, CFB, S100A, MMP9, and NOS2A significantly increased but with a low expression, IL6 and beta-defensin decreased. These activities were supervised by the NFKBIA to avoid excessive damage to bMECs. The bta-let-7a-5p, bta-miR-30a-5p, bta-miR-125b, and bta-miR-100 were essential to regulate infection process in bMECs after LPS induction. Moreover, the lactation potential of bMECs was undermined due to significantly downregulated SOSTDC1, WNT7B, MSX1, and bta-miR-2425-5p. In summary, bMECs may not be good at going head-to-head with the pathogens; they seem to be mainly charged with sending out signals for help and anti-apoptosis for maintaining lives after LPS induction.

AB Adipogenesis describes the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of mature adipocytes from primary adipocytes and is regulated by post-transcriptional modifications. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in mammalian development and physiology. However, the circRNA-mediated regulation of adipogenesis remains poorly understood. We profiled circRNA expression during bovine primary adipogenesis, detecting 16 circRNA candidates, including circPPAR gamma, which was abundant in the adipose tissue. Overexpression (overexpression plasmids) and interference (small interfering RNAs) with circPPAR gamma in bovine primary adipocytes, and proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis were analyzed using EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) cell proliferation, cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling apoptosis assay, Oil Red O staining, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting assays, which showed that circPPAR gamma facilitates adipocyte differentiation and inhibits proliferation and apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assays indicated that circPPAR gamma binds miR-92a-3p and YinYang 1 (YY1). A novel regulatory pathway regulating adipogenesis and adipose deposition was revealed.

AB Herein, a label-free, sensitive, and selective fluorescence method for the detection of trace selenite (Se(IV)) in water sample by carbon dots (CDs) was reported. The fluorescence CDs probe was simply and rapidly synthesized within 4 min by microwave-assisted pyrolysis of citric acid and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), with a relatively uniform size of approximately 2.6 nm. The fluorescence emission of as-prepared CDs was 450 nm upon the excitation of 400 nm with a quantum yield of about 8% against quinine sulfate as reference standard, which can be quenched by the addition of selenite. Benefit from the strong surface chelating reaction between DAB and Se (IV), the proposed sensor owned the advantage of high sensitivity (limit of detection = 0.5 ng/mL), wide linear range (1-100 ng/mL range, relative standard deviation: 3.8%), and excellent selectivity in the presence of various ions, even other forms of selenium, including selenate (Se(VI)), Selenomethionine (SeMet), and L-Selenocystine (SeCys) etc. Preliminary study on fluorescence quenching mechanism studied. The sensor was successfully exemplified for real water samples and exhibits comparative performance.

AB With the rapid development of science and technology, the emergence of new application scenarios, such as robots, driverless vehicles and smart city, puts forward high requirements for artificial visual systems. Optoelectronic synaptic devices have attracted much attention due to their advantages in sensing, memory and computing integration. In this work, via band structure engineering and heterostructure designing, a heterojunction optoelectronic synaptic device based on Cu doped with n-type SrTiO3(Cu:STO) film combined with p-type CuAlO2 (CAO) thin film was fabricated. It is found surprisingly that the optoelectronic device based on Cu:STO/CAO p-n heterojunction exhibits a rapid response of 2 ms, and that it has a wideband response from visible to near-infrared (NIR) region. Additionally, a series of important synaptic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), short-term potentiation (STP) to long-term potentiation (LTP) transition, learning experience behavior and image sharpening, have been successfully simulated on the device. More importantly, the performance of the device remains still stable and reliable after several months which were stored at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Based on these advantages, the optoelectronic synaptic devices demonstrated here provide great potential in the new generation of artificial visual systems.

AB In this study, the effects of 5 graded dietary levels (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.125%) of dimethylglycine (DMG) were studied in laying hens during the late laying period (71-78 wk). Graded doses of DMG from 0.025 to 0.125% in the diet produced quadratic positive (P < 0.05) responses in the laying rate, egg-feed ratio, yolk color, grade follicular weight, and the number of large white follicles and linear positive (P < 0.05) responses in average egg weight, and the number of large white follicles. With 0.1% DMG, the laying rate and egg-feed ratio improved (P < 0.05), and the abdominal fat percentage decreased. Considering the laying performance under the conditions used in this study, the best -fit model for the DMG requirements of laying hens was estimated to range from 0.049 to 0.065% DMG during the late laying period based on a regression analysis. The addition of DMG did not affect the total cholesterol (TCH) and triglyceride (TG) contents in the plasma of laying hens; however, it signifi-cantly reduced the abdominal fat rate. DMG may change the course of lipid deposition in laying hens during the late laying period. In conclusion, supplementation with DMG can improve the laying rate and follicles development of laying hens.

AB Pancreatitis is an inflammatory reaction of pancreatic tissue digestion, edema, bleeding and even necrosis caused by activation of pancreatin due to various causes. In particular, patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) often suffer from secondary infection, peritonitis and shock, and have a high mortality rate. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) can cause permanent damage to the pancreas. Due to the innate characteristics, structure and location of the pancreas, there is no effective treatment, only relief of symptoms. Especially, AP is an unpredictable and potentially fatal disease, and the timely diagnosis and treatment remains a major challenge. With the rapid development of nanomedicine technology, many potential tools can be used to address this problem. In this review, we have introduced the pathophysiological processes of pancreatitis to understanding its etiology and severity. Most importantly, the current progress in the diagnosis and treatment tools of pancreatitis based on nanomedicine is summarized and prospected.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is a complicated process, and most of the underlying regulators of this biological process are unknown. Here, we cloned the intact CDS of KLF4 gene, investigated the role of KLF4 by gaining or losing function in vitro and further explored the pathways of KLF4 regulating differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes in goat. Our results show that goat KLF4 gene consists of 1,536 bp encoding a protein of 486 amino acids. The expression of KLF4 is higher in the lung while lower in the heart and muscle in goat. Knockdown of KLF4 mediated by siRNA technique significantly promotes intramuscular preadipocyte lipid accumulation and upregulates mRNA expression of adipogenic related genes including C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, and PPAR gamma in vivo cultured cells. Consistently, overexpression of KLF4 inhibits intramuscular adipocyte lipid accumulation and significantly downregulation gene expression of C/EBP beta, PPAR gamma, aP2, and Pref-1. Further, we found that other members of KLFs were upregulated or downregulated after interference or overexpression of KLF4, including KLF2 and KLF5-7. We also found that C/EBP beta was a potential target of KLF4, because it had an opposite expression pattern with KLF4 during the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes and had putative binding sites of KLF4. The dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that overexpression of KLF4 inhibited the transcriptional activity of C/EBP beta. These results demonstrate that KLF4 inhibits the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes in goat by targeting C/EBP beta.

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria dominate 80% of the nitrogen fixation in nitrogen cycle. Herein, we investigated the toxicity and environmental impact of multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) to nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter chroococcum. MWCNTs slightly inhibited the growth of A. chroococcum and induced small increase of death rate at high concentrations. MWCNTs did not penetrate the cell walls of A. chroococcum and no cytoplasm loss was observed. MWCNTs were only observed surrounding the A. chroococcum cells. According to oxidative stress assays, MWCNTs induced meaningful oxidative damage at 0.5 mg/mL after 6 d exposure, but the oxidative damage diminished at 14 d. MWCNTs did not affect the nitrogen fixation activity of A. chroococcum and the soil nitrogen contents. Our findings provided the fundamental data for the environmental safety of CNTs to nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

TI Oxidation-Induced Breakage of the Imine Bond and Aggregate Transition in

AB Controlling the dynamic imine bonds upon a novel trigger except for pH and temperature is still a significant challenge. Here, a Se-containing imine-based dynamic covalent surfactant (HOBAB-BSeEA) was developed for the first time by mixing two precursors in situ: an asymmetric double-chain cationic surfactant bearing a formyl group at the terminal of one hydrophobic tail and a Se-containing amine (2-(benzylselanyl)ethan-1-amine ) in order to confirm the effect of redox on the imine bonds. The imine bond in HOBAB-BSeEA can be regulated not only upon changing the pH as well as other common imine-based surfactants but also by oxidation. The conversion efficiency of imine bonds is closely related with the degree of oxidation and pH. Complete oxidation can decrease the conversion efficiency from similar to 87 to 48%, which is comparable to the result of changing the pH from 10.0 to 7.0. With the formation and breaking of imine bonds, the surfactant can be reversibly switched between symmetric and asymmetric structures, accompanied by a morphological transition from vesicles to spherical micelles. Although oxidation cannot demolish all imine bonds, it can completely convert vesicles to spherical micelles, which is mainly ascribed to an increase in the polarity of the micellar microenvironment stemming from the oxidation of Se. However, this transition can only be achieved by reducing the pH to 5.0 instead of 7.0. Nile red loaded in HOBAB-BSeEA vesicles can be quickly, controllably, and step-by-step released upon oxidation stimulus but not pH. Understanding the mechanism of oxidation-induced breakage of imine bonds and disruption of vesicles would be useful in designing redox-responsive imine-based carriers that can unload cargoes according to the level of the local reactive oxygen species.

AB What is known and objective PARP inhibitors are currently one of the most promising PARP targeted drugs for patients with certain types of cancer. Gastrointestinal (GI) events are common adverse events for all PARP inhibitors. We conducted this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to fully investigate the incidence and the relative risk of GI events in cancer patients receiving PARP inhibitors.
   Study design Randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with PARP inhibitors were retrieved, and the systematic evaluation was conducted. Embase and PubMed/Medline were searched for articles published till July 2020.
   Results Twenty-nine RCTs and 9529 patients were included. The present meta-analysis suggests that the use of PARP inhibitors significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade nausea (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.29-1.66; p < .00001), vomiting (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.64; p = .0001), diarrhoea (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23; p = .0003) and decreased appetite (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.36; p < .00001), but not for constipation. And the use of these agents significantly increased the risk of high-grade nausea (RR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.44-2.74; p < .0001), vomiting (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.11-2.14; p = .01) and decreased appetite (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.22-3.40; p = .007), except for diarrhoea and constipation. Nausea was the most common GI event for these agents. Patients receiving veliparib were associated with a relatively lower risk of all-grade nausea and vomiting. Patients with ovarian cancer tend to have a higher risk of all-grade nausea and vomiting than those with non-ovarian cancer. The risk of all-grade nausea and vomiting tended to be higher when PARP inhibitors treatment was longer.
   What is new and conclusion PARP inhibitors were associated with a significant increased risk of GI events. Clinicians should be aware of these risks and perform regular monitoring.

AB The direct amination of benzoxazoles at C2 using N-heterocycles as nitrogen sources has been developed for the first time. Several kinds of inexpensive oxidants and also electricity were effective for this transformation in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl. This metal-free and operationally simple reaction can afford a variety of important C,N'-linked bis-heteocycles in moderate to good yields under very mild reaction conditions. The in situ generated oxoammonium salt was proved to be important for this transformation.

AB Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to liquid fuels and chemical feedstock, powered by renewable electricity, is an important approach for storing renewable energy and closing carbon cycle. Here, we study the pH effect on CO2 electroreduction selectivity over size-selected Au nanoparticles (NPs) in citrate buffer solutions with pH 3.7-6.0. A maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 96.3% is achieved over Au NPs at pH 6.0, and synthesis gas with tunable H-2/CO ratios (0.04-22) can be produced in the studied pH range. By careful kinetic analysis, the observed pH dependence reveals a most likely mixed mechanism of concerted proton-electron transfer and sequential electron-proton transfer in the initial step of CO2 activation. The pH-dependent selectivity changes over Au NPs can be rationalized by the difference in the pH dependence of CO2 electroreduction and concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides new guidelines into controlling activity and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction via efficiently tuning electrolyte pH.

AB A new solid solution of (1 - x)Ba0.86Sr0.14TiO3 - xBa(0.86)Sr(0.14)HfO(3)(abbreviated as BST - xBSH, 0.00 <= x <= 0.10) was prepared to search for a high-performance lead-free piezoelectric ceramics. Through the chemical of Hf tailoring, the enhanced electrical property (e.g.,d(33) similar to 650 pC/N,epsilon(r) similar to 4455, tan delta similar to 0.024, strain similar to 0.151%, andd(33)* similar to 502 pm/V) and large electrostriction coefficient (Q(33) = 0.0528 m(4)/C-2) are obtained in the ceramics withx = 0.06. The relationship between piezoelectric performance and electrostrictive coefficient is studied in detail. It's worth noting that the variation ofQ(33)is highly matched withd(33)because the electrostrictive effect plays a vital role in the piezoelectricity of ferroelectric materials. Therefore, it is very promising to increase the piezoelectricity by modifying electrostriction coefficient in lead-free materials for electromechanical actuator applications.

AB The temperature stability of potassium sodium niobate based materials has become a huge challenge due to its polymorphic phase boundary. How to thoroughly solve temperature sensitivity is one of the urgent aims in practical applications. Here, a new strategy of modifying R-T slope through phase content regulation has been achieved in lead-free ceramics of 0.96K(0.5)Na(0.5)Nb(0.955)Sb(0.045)O(3)-0.04[(1-x)Bi0.5Na0.5Zr0.3-xBi0.5Na0.5SnO3] (0 <= x <= 0.20) aiming to verify the relationship between phase content and temperature insensitivity. The temperature dependent on S-uni, d(33), and domain has proved that decreasing of tetragonal (T) phase content as rising rhombohedral-tetragonal phase transition temperature (TR-T) results in poor temperature stability. Moreover, an ideal R-T phase boundary similar to MPB model based on the results is proposed to possibly solve the fundamental problem of temperature sensitivity via increasing T phase content to modify the slope of R-T phase boundary. Therefore, it can be inferred that a more favorable temperature insensitivity can be obtained if one can construct a more slope R-T phase boundary, providing a new thought to consider how to thoroughly solve temperature sensitivity in KNN-based ceramics.

AB This paper investigates the general decay stability on systems represented by stochastic functional differential equations with semi-Markovian switching and Levy noise (SFDEs-SMS-LN). Based on functional Ito's formula, multiple degenerate Lyapunov functionals and nonnegative semi-martingale convergence theorem, new pth moment and almost surely stability criteria with general decay rate for SFDEs-SMS-LN are established. Meanwhile, the diffusion operators are allowed to be controlled by multiple auxiliary functions with time-varying coefficients, which can be more adaptable to the non-autonomous SFDEs-SMS-LN with high-order nonlinear coefficients. Furthermore, as applications of the presented stability criteria, new delay-dependent sufficient conditions for general decay stability of the stochastic delayed neural network with semi-Markovian switching and Levy noise (SDNN-SMS-LN) and the scalar non-autonomous SFDE-SMS-LN with non-global Lipschitz condition are respectively obtained in terms of binary diagonal matrices (BDMs) and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A more advanced two-sided looped-functional is adopted for the stability analysis of the linear impulsive system. Compared with existing methods based on functionals relying on Lyapunov's theorem, the positivity requirement of the functional is relaxed by the looped-functional. The other highlight is the full utilization of information on both the intervals x(t(k)) to x(t) and x(t) to x(t(k+1)) by the two-sided functional. Stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) derived on the ranged dwell-time are discrete-time stability results, which are expressed in continuous-time. Then, the stability result is further extended to the impulsive system with polytopic uncertainties. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding human mobility is one of the important but challenging tasks in Location-based Social Networks (LBSN). Recently, a user mobility mining task called Trajectory User Linking (TUL) has become an essential and popular topic, aiming at identifying user identities through exploiting their mobility patterns. Existing methods mainly focus on learning sequential mobility patterns by capturing long-short term dependencies among historical check-ins. However, users have personalized moving preferences, which have not been considered in previous work. Besides, how to leverage the prior knowledge behind human mobility needs to be further investigated. In this work, we present a novel semi-supervised method, called AdattTUL, to make adversarial mobility learning for human trajectory classification, which is an end-to-end framework modeling human moving patterns. AdattTUL integrates multiple human preferences of check-in behaviors and involves an attention mechanism to dynamically capture the complex relationships of user check-ins from trajectory data. In addition, AdattTUL leverages an adversarial network to help in regularizing the data distribution of human trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world LBSN datasets show that AdattTUL significantly improves the TUL performance.

AB The buff-throated partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii) is a hypoxia-tolerant bird living in an extremely inhospitable high-altitude environment, which has high ultraviolet (UV) radiation as well as a low oxygen supply when compared with low-altitude areas. To further understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of the high-altitude adaptation of the buff-throated partridges, we de novo assembled the complete genome of the buff-throated partridge. Comparative genomics revealed that positively selected hypoxia-related genes in the buff-throated partridge were distributed in the HIF-1 signaling pathway (map04066), response to hypoxia (GO:0001666), response to oxygen-containing compound (GO:1901700), ATP binding (GO:0005524), and angiogenesis (GO:0001525). Of these positively selected hypoxia-related genes, one positively selected gene (LONP1) had one buff-throated partridge-specific missense mutation which was classified as deleterious by PolyPhen-2. Moreover, positively selected genes in the buff-throated partridge were enriched in cellular response to DNA damage stimulus (corrected P value: 0.028006) and DNA repair (corrected P value: 0.044549), which was related to the increased exposure of the buff-throated partridge to UV radiation. Compared with other avian genomes, the buff-throated partridge showed expansion in genes associated with steroid hormone receptor activity and contractions in genes related to immune and olfactory perception. Furthermore, comparisons between the buff-throated partridge genome and red junglefowl genome revealed a conserved genome structure and provided strong evidence of the sibling relationship between Tetraophasis and Lophophorus. Our data and analysis contributed to the study of Phasianidae evolutionary history and provided new insights into the potential adaptation mechanisms to the high altitude employed by the buff-throated partridge.

AB We herein report a novel type of chiral carbon nanotube nanomaterial (MCNTs-PNG-CD) based on smart polymer brush grafted magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNTs) for highly efficient chiral recognition and separation of tryptophan enantiomers (DL-Trp). The grafted PNG-CD smart polymer brushes are composed of thermosensitive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PNG) copolymer chains with numerous appended beta-cyclodextrin (b-CD) units, which play a crucial role in efficient chiral discrimination and separation of DL-Trp. PNG-CD was fabricated on Fe3O4 nanoparticle-loaded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by combining surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) with a ring opening reaction. MCNTs-PNG-CD was systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and elemental analysis (EA). The prepared MCNTs-PNG-CD demonstrates highly thermosensitive chiral recognition and enantioselectivity toward DL-Trp, which is based on host-guest interactions between b-CD units and Ltryptophan (L-Trp) and the thermosensitive volume phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chains. The operating temperature and initial concentrations of AAs are two significant factors that affect the chiral recognition and separation of DL-Trp. Furthermore, the obtained MCNTs-PNG-CD also exhibits satisfactory reusability and excellent magnetic separability from enantiomeric solutions. Such a multifunctional CNT nanomaterial can serve as a high-performance nanoselector for direct enantioseparation of various chiral compounds.

AB Carbon nanomaterials are widely studied and applied nowadays, with annual production increasing. After entering the environment, the complete degradation of these carbon nanomaterials by microorganisms is proposed as an effective approach for detoxification and remediation. In this study, we evaluated the degradation of pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes (p-MWCNTs) and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (o-MWCNTs) by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which is a powerful decomposer in the carbon cycle and environmental remediation. Both p-MWCNTs and o-MWCNTs were partially oxidized by P. chrysosporium as indicated by the addition of oxygen atoms to the carbon skeleton in the forms of C=O and O-H bonds. The fungal oxidation led to the shortening of MWCNTs, where precipitated o-MWCNTs showed more short tubes. During the transformation, the defects on the tubes became detached from the carbon skeleton, resulting in decreases of the I-D/I-G (intensity of D-band/ intensity of G-band) values in Raman spectra. The transformation mechanism was attributed to the enzymatic degradation by laccase and manganese peroxidase excreted by P. chrysosporium. The results collectively indicated that MWCNTs could be transformed by P. chrysosporium, but complete degradation could not be achieved in a short time period. The implications on the environmental risks of carbon nanomaterials are discussed.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma (SGR), known as Tu-fu-ling in the China, Japan and Korea, is an herb that has been used for clearing damp and detoxification in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. The post-harvest drying of SGR has traditionally been done by the sun, but sometimes sulfur fumigation is used instead due to its low cost and high efficiency. Recent reports show that sulfur fumigation can change the chemical constitution of herbal medicines and decrease their biology activity.
   Aim of the study: This study will investigate the changes to the chemical constitution, acute toxicity and antioxidant potential of SGR that occur after sulfur fumigation. To date, no studies have investigated these aspects simultaneously.
   Materials and methods: An ultra-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint method was developed for analysing changes to SGR's chemical constitution caused by sulfur fumigation. The chromatography conditions were as follows: all samples were analysed on a Waters Acquity UHPLC HT3 C18 column; the linear gradient elution was conducted with a mobile phase prepared from acetonitrile and water. All calibration curves showed good linear regression (R > 0.9991) within the tested range. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, limit of detection and quantification. Total flavonoids of the raw and sulfur-fumigated samples were also determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The antioxidant properties of the extracts were evaluated using both DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. The acute toxicities of the raw and sulfur-fumigated samples were investigated.
   Results: The results demonstrate that the amounts of astilbin, neoastilbin, neoisoastilbin, isoastilbin, resveratrol and total flavonoids were lower in sulfur-fumigated samples than in raw samples. The antioxidant activity of the sulfur-fumigated samples was also significantly lower. Therefore, sulfur fumigation may cause chemical transformation, alter the chemical constitution, and decrease the bioactivity of SGR. Orally-administered doses did not cause mortality or changes in the general behaviour of tested mice. The LD50 was > 5000 mg/kg DW. However, the high-dose S-SGR mice had significant liver damage and high levels of plasma biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, DBIL, TBIL).
   Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest that sulfur fumigation can decrease antioxidant activity in vitro; and that orally-administrated S-SGR is unsafe at doses > 3000 mg/kg dried materia medica. Therefore, sulfur-fumigation processing should be forbidden for SGR until its efficacy and safety has been demonstrated. An alternative method of sulfur fumigation for the post-harvest processing of SGR should also be developed.

TI Effects of different segments in polyurethane on the performance of sand

AB Synthetic polymers have recently drawn increasing attention to chemical sand stabilization (CSS). The relationship between the molecular structure and the fixing effect, however, is rarely reported aside from the performance. In this article, different segments of waterborne polyurethane dispersions (PUDs) are discussed with respect to their influence on stabilizing sand. We prepared five PUDs by controlling parameters including the diisocyanate-to-polyol ratio (R) and the molecular weight and characterized them with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and laser particle analysis. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS), a key criterion in CSS, was used to evaluate the performance of the PUDs. We found that a bigger R gave the polyurethane (PU) film a higher strength than the smaller R but did not do the same to the sand mold. This indicated that homogeneity was a primary property of the sand mold. Taking the details of the crushed sand molds and the PU films into account, we concluded that the soft segments played a major role in the homogeneity. Force analysis showed that four modes of breaking occurred at the interface of the sand and cured PU. We concluded that whereas the hard segments in PU determined the ceiling of the UCS, the soft segments determined the floor by benefiting adsorption. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB Context: Ajuga ovalifolia Bur. et Franch. var. calantha (Diels) C. Y. Wu et C. Chen (Labiatae), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat several inflammatory diseases.
   Objective: To assess the anti-inflammatory activity of ajudecumin A isolated from Ajuga ovalifolia var. calantha, and its possible mechanisms.
   Materials and methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 mu g/mL)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of ajudecumin A (1-40 mu M) in vitro. Nitric oxide levels were evaluated by Griess reagent. The mRNA levels of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 were determined using qRT-PCR. Phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK and I kappa B alpha were detected by western Blot. To further assess the anti-inflammatory of ajudecumin A in vivo, mice were oral treated with ajudecumin A (10 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg, positive control) for 5 days before administration of carrageenan or xylene. Paw and ear edema were then measured, respectively.
   Results: Ajudecumin A (10-40 mu M) decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide production with an IC50 value of 16.19 mu M. Ajudecumin A (20 and 40 mu M) also attenuated cell spreading and formation of pseudopodia-like structures, and decreased the mRNA levels of iNOS (55.23-67.04%, p < 0.001), COX-2 (57.58-70.25%, p < 0.001), TNF-alpha (53.75-58.94%, p < 0.01-0.001), IL-1 beta (79.41-87.85%, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (54.26-80.52%, p < 0.01-0.001) in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, ajudecumin A suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and I kappa B alpha, as well as I kappa B alpha degradation (p < 0.05-0.001). Finally, ajudecumin A (10 mg/kg) attenuated carrageenan- and xylene-induced inflammation in mice by about 28 and 24%, respectively.
   Discussion and conclusions: Ajudecumin A exhibited a potent anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo through inhibition on NF-kappa B and ERK/p38 MAPK pathways, suggesting that ajudecumin A may be potentially developed as a lead compound in anti-inflammatory drug discovery.

AB Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis to systematically review the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors for advanced melanoma. Study design: The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials in melanoma patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. Databases were searched till June 2018. Results: PD-1 inhibitors significantly improved the progression-free survival, overall survival and overall response rate in patients with advanced melanoma. Progression-free survival, overall survival and overall response rate did not vary significantly according to PD-L1 status, V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations and type of drug, but varied significantly by control therapy. PD-1 inhibitors were associated with a decreased risk of adverse events compared with ipilimumab, but an increased risk of immune-related events compared with chemotherapy. Conclusion: The PD-1 inhibitors-containing therapy was efficacious in treating advanced melanoma.

AB We performed a meta-analysis to fully investigate the skin toxicities of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (EGFR-MoAbs) in cancer patients. The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with EGFR-MoAbs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published till November 2017. The relevant RCTs in cancer patients treated with EGFR-MoAbs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. 65 RCTs and 25994 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of EGFR-MoAbs significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade and high-grade skin toxicity, such as rash, hand-foot syndrome, dry skin and oral mucositis. Rash was the most common skin toxicity. Patients receiving nimotuzumab were associated with the least risk of skin toxicity. The risk of high-grade skin toxicity tended to be higher in the study in which the EGFR-MoAbs treatment duration was longer. The available data suggested that the use of EGFR-MoAbs significantly increases the risk of developing skin toxicity. Physicians should be aware of skin toxicity and should monitor cancer patients when receiving EGFR-MoAbs.

AB Liver kinase B1 (Lkb1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are key regulators of energy metabolism and cell growth. We have previously reported that adipocyte-specific KO of Lkb1 or mTOR in mice results in distinct developmental and metabolic phenotypes. Here, we aimed to assess how genetic KO of both Lkb1 and mTOR affects adipose tissue development and function in energy homeostasis. We used Adiponectin-Cre to drive adipocyte-specific double KO (DKO) of Lkb1 and mTOR in mice. We performed indirect calorimetry, glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and gene expression assays on the DKO and WT mice. We found that DKO of Lkb1 and mTOR results in reductions of brown adipose tissue and inguinal white adipose tissue mass, but in increases of liver mass. Notably, the DKO mice developed fatty liver and insulin resistance, but displayed improved glucose tolerance after high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding. Interestingly, the DKO mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity due to their higher energy expenditure and lower expression levels of adipogenic genes (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and PPAR) compared with WT mice. These results together indicate that, compared with Lkb1 or mTOR single KOs, Lkb1/mTOR DKO in adipocytes results in overlapping and distinct metabolic phenotypes, and mTOR KO largely overrides the effect of Lkb1 KO.

AB Recently, oligomers of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been an important topic in the GPCR fields. However, knowledge about their structures and activation mechanisms is very limited due to the absence of crystal structures reported. In this work, we used multiscale simulations to study the effects of homodimerization between different conformation states on their activation, dynamic behaviors, and allosteric communication pathways for -OR. The results indicated that the dimerization of one inactive monomer with either one inactive monomer or one active one could enhance its constitutive activation. However, the conformation state of the other protomer (e.g., active or inactive) can influence the activated extent. The dimerization between the two inactive protomers leads to a negative cooperativity for their activation, which should contribute to the asymmetric activation of GPCR dimers observed in some experiments. On the other hand, for the active monomer, its dimerization with one inactive receptor could alleviate its deactivation, whereby negative and positive cooperativities can be observed between the two subunits of the dimer, depending on the different regions. Observations from protein structure network (PSN) analysis indicated that the dimerization of one inactive monomer with one active one would cause a significant drop in the number of main pathways from the ligand binding pocket to the G-protein coupled region for the inactive protomer, while the impact is minor for the active protomer. But, for the active monomer or the inactive one, its dimerization with one inactive monomer would significantly change the types of residues participating in the pathway with the highest frequency.

AB Gentiana veitchiorum Hemsl., Gentianaceae, a traditional Tibetan medicine, was used for the treatment of liver jaundice with damp-heat pathogen, as well as for headache and chronic pharyngitis. A rapidultra-performance liquid chromatography, photodiode array detector, quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the fast and accurate identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of G. veitchiorum. In fact, eighteen compounds were detected and identified on the basis of their mass spectra, fragment characteristics and comparison with published data. Especially, the MS fragmentation pathways of iridoid glycosides and flavone C-glycosides were illustrated. Five compounds among them were quantified by UHPLC-PDA, including swertiamarin, gentiopicroside, sweroside, isoorientin, and isovitexin. The proposed method was then validated based on the analyses of linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. The overall recoveries for the five analytes ranged from 96.54% to 100.81%, with RSD from 1.05% to 1.82%. In addition, ten batches of G. veitchiorum from different areas were also analyzed. The developed method was rapid and reliable for both identification and quantification of the chemical constituents of G. veitchiorum, especially for simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of iridoid glycosides and flavone C-glycosides.

AB Organic synthesis efficiency can take considerable advantage from microwave heating. Compared to conventional heating, it allows to improve the reactions speed and yield through an energy-efficient, clean, and easy-to-use processing tool. Transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and in particular the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling is powerful and widely used tool for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Cross coupling reactions are of large interest for the bonding of a broad range of functional groups, in particular biaryl groups, allowing for a strong stereoselectivity. In this paper, recent research results concerning the application of microwave heating in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions are reviewed with particular emphasis on reactions involving supported Pd as a catalyst.

AB Environmental biosafety is the key issue in the healthy development of the graphene industry, but the toxicity of graphene to moss is still unknown to date. Herein, we investigated the influence of graphene oxide (GO) on the growth, chlorophyll content and structure of white moss Leucobryum glaucum. Our results indicated that GO did not alter the fresh weight of L. glaucum, but inhibited the dry weight gain seriously, resulting in higher water-holding rates. GO induced the suppression of chlorophyll contents and up-regulated the chlorophyll a/b ratios, thus might influence the photosynthesis of L. glaucum. GO disturbed the microstructure and ultrastructure of L. glaucum at high concentrations, inducing the destruction of cell wall, the separation of cell wall and membrane, and the formation of micropores on the leave surface. GO led to the decrease of glutathione levels and catalase activities of L. glaucum, suggesting the existence of oxidative stress. Our results collectively suggested that graphene had the potential environmental risk to moss plants, and the release of graphene into the environment should be strictly restricted.

The results of structural parameters and band gap calculated using HSE06 with 25% short-range HF exchange agree well with experimental data. The nature of the band gap in CdSiP2 is predicted to be pseudodirect by comparing the band structures of CdSiP2 and GaP. The bonding properties are analyzed based on the Bader charge and the electronic localization function. In addition, the optical spectrums are derived and main spectral features are interpreted in terms of the electronic structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anti-angiogenesis has been proposed as an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is one of the most powerful endogenous anti-angiogenic reagents discovered to date and PEDF gene therapy has been recognized as a promising treatment option for various tumors. There is an urgent need to develop a safe and valid vector for its systemic delivery. Herein, a novel gene delivery system based on the newly synthesized copolymer COOH-PEG-PLGA-COOH (CPPC) was developed in this study, which was probably capable of overcoming the disadvantages of viral vectors and cationic lipids/polymers-based nonviral carriers. PEDF gene loaded CPPC nanoparticles (D-NPs) were fabricated by a modified double-emulsion water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) solvent evaporation method. D-NPs with uniform spherical shape had relatively high drug loading (similar to 1.6%), probably because the introduced carboxyl group in poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) terminal enhanced the interaction of copolymer with the PEDF gene complexes. An excellent in vitro antitumor effect was found in both C26 and A549 cells treated by D-NPs, in which PEDF levels were dramatically elevated due to the successful transfection of PEDF gene. D-NPs also showed a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and inhibited the tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo by an alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay. Further in vivo antitumor investigation, carried out in a C26 subcutaneous tumor model by intravenous injection, demonstrated that D-NPs could achieve a significant antitumor activity with sharply reduced microvessel density and significantly promoted tumor cell apoptosis. Additionally, the in vitro hemolysis analysis and in vivo serological and biochemical analysis revealed that D-NPs had no obvious toxicity. All the data indicated that the novel CPPC nanoparticles were ideal vectors for the systemic delivery of PEDF gene and might be widely used as systemic gene vectors.

AB Viscoelastic wormlike micelles have attracted special interests over the past decade due to their unique rheological response. Few efforts were however devoted to the rheological properties of worms in high-salinity solution. Here, worm-containing viscoelastic fluid is designed from single N-erucamidopropyl-N,N-dimethyl carboxybetaine (EMAB), using brine water (total dissolved solids: 32,868 mg L-1; [Ca2+] + [Mg2+]: 873 mg L-1) as solvent. Upon increasing concentration, EMAB brine solution shows remarkable macroscopic viscoelasticity above a low overlapping concentration (0.04 wt%) without adding special hydrotropes, implying a giant 3D network-like entanglement formation. Such a viscoelastic network aggregates exhibit thermo-induced thickening behavior in a comparable temperature range due to the hydrogen bond interaction, and excellent thermal stability. The apparent viscosity at 170 s(-1) can keep above 50 mPa . s at 130 degrees C for 2 hours. These preliminary results will give EMAB a rich prospective for use as rheological modifier, especially for using in some extremely environment such high temperature, high salinity, and high shear.

AB Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (Cirp), the first cold-shock protein identified in mammals, is a sensor protein whose expression increases in response to stress. Recent reports have shown that Cirp is involved in cell proliferation, development, circadian modulation under physiological conditions, and tumor formation and progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activities of Cirp in the mammalian kidney cells remain unclear. In this study, we constructed BHK-21cells overexpressing Cirp (Cirp+BHK-21) knockdown BHK-21 cells (Cirp-BHK-21) to investigate the function of Cirp in cell proliferation. We analyzed the gene expression of Cirp-BHK-21 cells using genome-wide expression microarrays to explore the molecular mechanism of Cirp action. We found that (1) Cirp overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation, whereas Cirp knockdown dramatically reduced cell proliferation, suggesting that Cirp is a positive regulator of BHK-21 cell proliferation. (2) Differentially expressed genes in Cirp-BHK-21 and control cells were shown to be involved in many biological processes. (3) Pathway analysis showed that five enriched pathways, namely, Focal adhesion, Mapk, Wnt, Apoptosis, and Cancer-related signaling pathways, were identified as central pathway networks regulated by Cirp. These results can provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Cirp function.

AB Chess is a good model to study high-level human brain functions such as spatial cognition, memory, planning, learning and problem solving. Recent studies have demonstrated that non-invasive MRI techniques are valuable for researchers to investigate the underlying neural mechanism of playing chess. For professional chess players (e. g., chess grand masters and masters or GM/Ms), what are the structural and functional alterations due to long-term professional practice, and how these alterations relate to behavior, are largely veiled. Here, we report a multimodal MRI dataset from 29 professional Chinese chess players (most of whom are GM/Ms), and 29 age matched novices. We hope that this dataset will provide researchers with new materials to further explore high-level human brain functions.

AB Fullerene, C-60, and its derivatives, have been fully investigated and commercialized. The importance of large carbon cage-based fullerenes for biomedical applications was gradually recognized due to their fantastic biological effects. In nanotoxicology, the key detection techniques are able to retain the intrinsic structure and properties of nanomaterials in a biological background. However, there were puzzling questions regarding how to facilely obtain detectable fullerene nanomaterials and their formation process. In this study, C-13-enriched fullerenes of a large carbon cage, C-70, were synthesized on a large scale from a C-13-enriched raw carbon material by an arc-discharge method. The stable isotope C-13 was directly incorporated into the skeleton of the fullerene cages without destroying their intrinsic structures. The isotopic effects of C-13-labeled C-70 were investigated in detail. The amount of C-13 labelling of C-70 was about 7% higher than that of the natural abundance, which greatly improved the C-13 detection signal in isotope ratio mass spectrometry and gave an apparent 8-fold carbon nuclear magnetic resonance signal enhancement for the fullerenes. The C-13-enriched fullerenes showed significant isotopic effects, such as the strongest peak position shifting up (m/z > 840) and the Poisson distribution of the isotopic peaks in the mass spectra, and the migration or splitting of infrared and Raman characteristic peaks. When comparing the C-13 labelling amounts and the isotopic effects of C-13-enriched C-70 and those of C-13-enriched C-60, the formation dynamics of the fullerenes were different with different carbon cages; lower carbon cage fullerenes were easily generated in the arc-discharge process, and the C-13 stable isotopic effects in high carbon fullerenes were also slightly weak. Moreover, these important isotopic effects of the C-13-enriched fullerenes will facilitate the development of new analytical methods for carbon nanomaterials in vivo.

AB The skin stratum corneum (SC) barrier function will interfere with the absorption of topical treatment and reduce the drug's therapeutic effect on alopecia. Microneedles (MNs) can penetrate the skin barrier and deliver drugs to the dermis. Furthermore, MNs can mechanically stimulate the skin, which promotes hair growth. Thus, we designed a green and dissolvable composite microneedle made of hyaluronic acid (HA) and Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) to encapsulate cholesterol-free ginsenoside Rg3 liposomes (Rg3-LPs) to avoid cholesterol metabolism-producing testosterone to inhibit hair regeneration and minimize the effect of the SC barrier on liposomes absorption. HA and BSP can enhance the mechanical strength of Rg3-MNs to ensure the transport of liposomes to the hair follicle (HF) region while causing minimal skin irritation and guaranteeing cell compatibility. In addition, HA increased hair density and was more conducive to hair regeneration. In telogen effluvium (TE) and testosterone-induced androgenetic alopecia (AGA) animals, Rg3-MNs achieved comparable efficacy to minoxidil with low-frequency treatment and the quality of regenerated hair was higher. Furthermore, quantitative characterization and transcriptome sequencing results showed that Rg3-MNs promoted hair regeneration by promoting the expression of Wnt3a and Wnt10b genes, activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, Rg3-MNs present broad prospects in the treatment of alopecia.

DT Article
DE capsaicin; chronic low-grade inflammation; anti-obesity; gut barrier;
   gut microbiota
AB Chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) is associated with obesity and is one of its pathogenetic mechanisms. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, is the principal cause of CLGI. Studies have found that capsaicin significantly reduces the relative abundance of LPS-producing bacteria. In the present study, TRPV1-knockout (TRPV1-/-) C57BL/6J mice and the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 (TRPV1-/-) were used as models to determine the effect of capsaicin on CLGI and elucidate the mechanism by which it mediates weight loss in vivo and in vitro. We found that the intragastric administration of capsaicin significantly blunted increases in body weight, food intake, blood lipid, and blood glucose in TRPV1-/- mice fed a high-fat diet, suggesting an anti-obesity effect of capsaicin. Capsaicin reduced LPS levels in the intestine by reducing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter, Desulfovibrio, and Sutterella. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) levels decreased following decreases in LPS levels. Then, the local inflammation of the intestine was reduced by reducing the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 mediated by TLR4. Attenuating local intestinal inflammation led to the increased expression of tight junction proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin and the restoration of the intestinal barrier function. Capsaicin increased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin at the transcriptional and translational levels, thereby increasing trans-endothelial electrical resistance and restoring intestinal barrier function. The restoration of intestinal barrier function decreases intestinal permeability, which reduces the concentration of LPS entering the circulation, and reduced endotoxemia leads to decreased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, thereby attenuating CLGI. This study sheds light on the anti-obesity effect of capsaicin and its mechanism by reducing CLGI, increasing our understanding of the anti-obesity effects of capsaicin. It has been confirmed that capsaicin can stimulate the expression of intestinal transmembrane protein ZO-1 and cytoplasmic protein occludin, increase the trans-epithelial electrical resistance value, and repair intestinal barrier function.

AB Drying is an essential post-harvest processing technique used to improve the utilization efficiency of fresh fruit. The browning of Choerospondias axillaris fruits during the drying process can reduce their overall quality. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the browning degree and polyphenolics in C. axillaris fruits. Different browning samples dried by freeze (FD), microwave (MD), and hot air (HAD) methods, respectively, exhibited color differences (Delta E) ranging from 14.53 to 64.78. UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS analysis of the polyphenolic fractions from fresh fruit (FF), FD, MD, and HAD identified 83, 83, 83, and 56 compounds, respectively. Eight compounds were quantified by UPLC-QQQ MS-MS to evaluate the samples of different browning degrees. Correlation analysis results of HAD demonstrated the highest Delta E, while increased quantities of monomeric phenolic acids and total phenolics, attributed to enzymatic browning and oxidation degradation of flavanols. FD, led to the lowest Delta E and exhibited significantly higher levels of monomeric flavanols and total flavonoids, as well as greater antioxidant activity. It was concluded that FD could be an effective anti-browning method and suitable for the processing of C. axillaris fruits with high quality.

AB Tartary buckwheat sprout is commonly consumed as salads and healthy vegetables, which is rich in pectic polysaccharides. Nevertheless, the knowledge about pectic polysaccharides extracted from Tartary buckwheat sprouts (TBSP) are still limited. To facilitate the potential applications of TBSP as fortified ingredients or healthy foods, the impacts of conventional hot water extraction (CHW), deep eutectic solvent (DES)-assisted extraction (DEE), and high pressure-assisted DES extraction (HPDEE) on their structural and biological properties were evaluated. Compared with the CHW method, our findings revealed that both DEE and HPDEE methods could obviously promoted the yields of TBSP and regulated their structural properties, resulting in the improvement of their biological functions. Especially, the HPDEE method could obviously decreased the molecular mass, apparent viscosity, and esterification degree of TBSP, while notably increased the uronic acids and bound flavonoids. Indeed, the HPDEE method could remarkedly enhance the antioxidant, anti-glycosylation, and immunostimulatory activities of TBSP probably via reducing its molecular mass and degree of esterification, and increasing its free uronic acids and bound flavonoids. These findings reveal that the HPDEE method has good potentials for selectively extracting distinctive TBSP with superior biological functions.

AB The characteristic aroma compounds of braised pork were identified through molecular sensory science and PLSR analysis, and the difference between two cooking methods, traditional open-fire (BPF) and induction cooker (BPC), was compared. Seventeen aroma compounds with odor activity values (OAVs) > 1 were identified in both samples. BPF revealed higher OAVs for most of the aroma compounds compared to BPC, and the higher aroma quality. Aroma recombination and omission experiments confirmed that twelve aroma compounds significantly contributed to the characteristic aroma of braised pork, and eight compounds such as hexanal, (E)2-octenal, and methanethiol were further confirmed as important contributors by PLSR analysis. Furthermore, PLSR analysis clarified the role of aldehydes such as hexanal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal in contributing to fatty attribute, whereas methanethiol was responsible for the meaty aroma. These characteristic aroma compounds mainly derived from lean meat due to its high content of phospholipids, and the exogenous seasonings contributed to the balanced characteristic aroma profile of braised pork by altering the distribution of these characteristic aroma compounds. Variations in heating parameters affected the formation of lipid oxidation and Strecker degradation products, which might explain aroma discrepancy between braised pork cooked by two methods with different heat transfer efficiencies.

AB Mo/ZnO/NiF@GO/ZnFe2O4/CC photo-electrochemical catalyzed oxidation system was developed for efficiently degrading tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) by enhanced photocatalytic action. Multifunctional dual electrodes served as oxidation interface and electron transport medium exhibited inconsistent morphology, promoting more catalytic reactions at active sites, photo-electro-catalytic activity and exchange current density of the novel electrodes prepared by hydro-deposition were revealed by Cyclic Voltammetry, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Linear sweep voltammetry techniques. indicating the photoanode approximation to two-electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction at a voltage of about 0.11 V, thus producing H2O2 with oxidizing properties. Constructed system assisted by dual electrodes achieved efficient separation of electron-hole and microcell-activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Experimental results demonstrated the remarkable efficiency of the system (> 97.0 % for 20 mg/L TC-HCl in 20 min) under optimized conditions (0.2 mM PMS, R = 1800 Omega).The reusability and stability of the system are verified by cyclic experiments. The abiotic toxicity of the intermediates was analyzed and speculated, and the recommended degradation pathways and mechanisms of TC-HCl were elucidated. The experimental system is stable, efficient and an environmentally friendly method for pollution treatment.

ID LINEAR-SYSTEMS; CRITERIA; DESIGN; DELAYS
AB This paper addresses the exponential stability issue of discrete -time switched nonlinear systems by means of the linearization approach. Generally speaking, the linearization method requires that the vector field of the original nonlinear system is continuously differentiable. Since the vector field of a switched system does not meet the differentiable condition (discontinuous at switching instants), the linearization method is seldom used in the context of switched systems. In the present paper, it is assumed that the vector field of each subsystem is continuously differentiable. With this assumption, two Lyapunov theorems are proposed to verify the exponential and asymptotic stabilities of the considered system. Applying these results and using the linearized system, a multiple homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function (HPLF) is adapted to establish the exponential stability of switched nonlinear systems. Moreover, it is shown that the conservatism of the stability condition reduces as the degree of the HPLF increases. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Previous bismuth-based photocatalysts usually employ a strong acid solution (e.g., HNO3 solution) to obtain an ultrathin structure toward high photocatalytic activity. In this work, the ultrathin layered BiOIO3 nanosheets are successfully synthesized using just the glucose hydrothermal solution. The high-concentration glucose solution shows the obvious acidity after the hydrothermal process, which leads to the quick decrease in thickness of BiOIO3 nanosheets from similar to 45.58 to similar to 5.74 nm. The ultrathin structure can greatly improve charge carriers' separation and transfer efficiency. The generation of reductive iodide ions brings about oxygen vacancies in the ultrathin nanosheets, then the defect energy level is formed, causing the decreased band gap and improving the visible light absorption. Compared to thick BiOIO3 nanosheet with little oxygen vacancies, much higher carrier separation efficiency and visible light absorption are achieved in the ultrathin nanosheets with oxygen vacancies, resulting in an excellent photocatalytic performance (0.1980 min(-1) for RhB degradation), which is much higher than most other bismuth-based photocatalysts. The superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)-) and holes (h(+)) are the major active species responsible for high photocatalytic activity. This work affords an environmentally friendly strategy to synthesize ultrathin photocatalysts with superior photocatalytic properties.

AB Purpose How does the regional institutional environment of China's transitional economy influence the relationship between a firm's R&D investment intensity and innovation performance? Based on the resource-based view and institution-based view, an empirical study was executed to identify the moderating effects of institutional environment variables from the Marketization Index of China's Provinces: National Economic Research Institute (NERI) Report on the relationship between a firm's R&D investment intensity and innovation performance. This paper aims to study how effectively improve the impact of R&D investment intensity on innovation performance under the influence of the institutional environment.Design/methodology/approach Against the background of China's transitional economy, the authors present empirical evidence from panel data covering 374 Chinese A-share listed high-tech manufacturing firms on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange to examine the relationship between R&D investment intensity and innovation performance.Findings Empirical results illustrate the following: The R&D investment intensity and innovation performance displayed an inverse U-shaped relationship, and R&D investment intensity had a lagged effect on R&D output according to the uncertainty and industrialization period of R&D activities. The level of financial market development can intensify the effects of R&D investment intensity on innovation performance. The degree of government intervention weakens the effect of R&D investment intensity on innovation performance.Originality/value Based on the background of China's institutional environment during the transition period, combined with previous research and the Marketization Index of China's Provinces: NERI Report, selecting financial market development, government intervention level and legalization level as moderating variables to study how effectively improve the impact of R&D investment intensity on innovation performance under the influence of the institutional environment. Due to the different ownership of firms during the transition period, the appropriate impact of the institutional environment on the relationship between R&D investment intensity and innovation performance will vary. Moreover, the level of legalization would impact on innovation insignificantly.

AB BackgroundInternational students encounter a wide range of challenges that can have a significant impact on their mental health. Seeking help is one of the primary means of managing mental health, and more attention is required. This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress(PD), mental health literacy(MHL), and mental help-seeking intentions(MHSI) in international students of National University of Singapore(NUS), to explore the correlation between the three and to verify the mediating role of MHL in PD and MHSI.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted between May and July 2023 using the Mental Help Seeking Intention Scale(MHSIS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7), and Mental Health Literacy Scale(MHLS). 281 international students(177 males, 104 females;) in NUS completed self-report questionnaires. SPSS 25.0 was applied to the data for descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis. Mediation analysis fully for all potential confounding factors were conducted.ResultsSignificant correlations were found between PD, MHL and MHSI. MHLS- knowledge of how to seek professional information(MHLS- H) completely mediated the association of anxiety with MHSI[B=-0.271; 95% confidence interval(CI): (-0.067, 0.0037)]; MHLS- attitude that promote recognition or appropriate help-seeking behavior(stigma)(MHLS- H) partially mediated the association of PD with MHSI[B = 0.104, 95% CI: (0.008, 0.179)]; with mediating effects accounting for 100% and 24.847% of the total effect. In addition, demographic variables such as gender, years in Singapore and residence type mediated both the direct and indirect effect of the mediation model.ConclusionsMHL mediated both the direct and indirect effects on the association between PD and MHSI, especially, the mediator of the MHLS- H and MHL-A. It means that MHSI in this population can be improved by increasing MHL and thus the PD. The findings suggest that, such as providing information about how to access to professional services and promoting disorder recognition to the international students, may help them develop their psychological well-being and good mental health care decisions.
   Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms was observed in 19.57% and 20.28% of the participants, respectively.The MHSI displayed significant variations across demographic characteristics.Depression, MHLS- A, MHLS- H, and gender were identified as significant predictors of MHSI.A significant mediating effect of MHL was observed in the relationship between PD and MHSI.

ID MODIFIED S-TRANSFORM
AB Vigorously developing new energy sources such as wind power and photovoltaics will promote the low-carbon transformation of the power system. With the increase of the penetration rate of distributed energy in the dis-tribution network, many complex and changeable power quality disturbance have been generated, which will seriously affect the stability of the distribution network. This paper presents a new method for effectively identifying and classifying the complex and variable PQDs, which is based on proposed improved adaptive S-transform (IAST) and random forest (RF). The IAST first employs proposed iterative loop filter envelope extremum algorithm which can effectively detect the main frequency points of PQDs, followed by proposed time -frequency resolution optimization improvement method that optimally adjusts the standard deviation sigma to adaptively control the Gaussian window width D. In addition, a parameter F is used to make IAST more flexible. Through IAST, various PQDs features can be extracted, and then which will be classified using Random Forest (RF). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive tests are conducted on the diverse simulation PQDs and the actual data obtained from the practical power systems. The work in this paper can provide a good choice for the design and development of an intelligent monitoring and analysis system for distribution network disturbances.

AB Habitat loss is the main threat to global biodiversity in the Anthropocene. To prevent this, protected areas are the most effective means for safeguarding biodiversity. However, extensive habitat protection under human pressure can undermine its effectiveness. Using the Hengduan Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot in southwest China as an indicator, we assessed the extent and intensity of human pressure to highlight how these pressures have changed over time. We found that most ecoregions had high levels of intact habitat loss relative to areal protection by national nature reserves (NNRs). More than two-fifths of protected land is under intense human pressure, and lower elevation or smaller NNRs were subject to higher pressure. These increases have predominantly occurred in lower elevation NNRs, showing that elevation gradients correlate with increasing pressure. While protected areas are increasingly established, they are experiencing intense human pressure. Our findings provide useful insights for assessing resilience of protected areas and to prioritize areas where future conservation plans and actions should be focused in a changing world.

TI Expression Variation of CPT1A Induces Lipid Reconstruction in

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is one of the most important factors affecting meat quality and is closely associated with the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) which facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) into the mitochondria. However, the role of how CPT1A regulates the IMF formation remains unclear. Herein, we established the temporal expression profile of CPT1A during the differentiation of goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. Functionally, the knockdown of CPT1A by siRNA treatment significantly increased the mRNA expression of adipogenic genes and promoted lipid deposition in goat intramuscular precursor adipocytes. Meanwhile, a CPT1A deficiency inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis significantly. CPT1A was then supported by the overexpression of CPT1A which significantly suppressed the cellular triglyceride deposition and promoted cell proliferation although the cell apoptosis also was increased. For RNA sequencing, a total of 167 differential expression genes (DEGs), including 125 upregulated DEGs and 42 downregulated DEGs, were observed after the RNA silencing of CPT1A compared to the control, and were predicted to enrich in the focal adhesion pathway, cell cycle, apoptosis and the MAPK signaling pathway by KEGG analysis. Specifically, blocking the MAPK signaling pathway by a specific inhibitor (PD169316) rescued the promotion of cell proliferation in CPT1A overexpression adipocytes. In conclusion, the expression variation of CPT1A may reconstruct the lipid distribution between cellular triglyceride deposition and cell proliferation in goat intramuscular precursor adipocyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CPT1A promotes the proliferation of goat adipocytes through the MAPK signaling pathway. This work widened the genetic regulator networks of IMF formation and delivered theoretical support for improving meat quality from the aspect of IMF deposition.

AB IntroductionThis study was conducted to assess the effect of mixed isoacid (MI) supplementation on fermentation characteristics, nutrient apparent digestibility, growth performance, and rumen bacterial community in yaks. MethodsA 72-h in vitro fermentation experiment was performed on an ANKOM RF gas production system. MI was added to five treatments at doses of 0, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% on the dry matter (DM) basis of substrates using a total of 26 bottles (4 bottles per treatment and 2 bottles as the blank). Cumulative gas production was measured at 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h. Fermentation characteristics including pH, the concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), microbial proteins (MCP), and the disappearance rate of dry matter (DMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDFD), and acid detergent fiber (ADFD) were measured after a 72-h in vitro fermentation to determine an optimal MI dose. Fourteen Maiwa male yaks (180-220 kg, 3-4 years old of age) were randomly assigned to the control group (without MI, n = 7) and the supplemented MI group (n = 7, supplemented with 0.3% MI on DM basis) for the 85-d animal experiment. Growth performance, nutrient apparent digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters, and rumen bacterial diversity were measured. ResultsSupplementation with 0.3% MI achieved the greatest propionate and butyrate content, NDFD and ADFD compared with other groups (P < 0.05). Therefore, 0.3% was used for the animal experiment. Supplementation with 0.3% MI significantly increased the apparent digestibility of NDF and ADF (P < 0.05), and the average daily weight gain of yaks (P < 0.05) without affecting the ruminal concentration of NH3-N, MCP, and VFAs. 0.3% MI induced rumen bacteria to form significantly different communities when compared to the control group (P < 0.05). g__norank_f__Bacteroidales_BS11_gut_group, g__norank_f__Muribaculaceae, g__Veillonellaceae_UCG-001, g__Ruminococcus_gauvreauii_group, g__norank_f__norank_o__RF39 and g__Flexilinea were identified as the biomarker taxa in responding to supplementation with 0.3% MI. Meanwhile, the abundance of g__Flexilinea and g__norank_f__norank_o__RF39 were significantly positively correlated with the NDF digestibility (P < 0.05). ConclusionIn conclusion, supplementation with 0.3% MI improved the in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics, feed fiber digestibility, and growth performance in yaks, which was associated with changes of the abundance of g__Flexilinea and g__norank_f__norank_o__RF39.

AB New ceramic membranes (CM) using environment-oriented materials instead of rare materials are more attractive and easier to large-scale engineering and promotion. In this study, the feasibility of customizing low-cost and robust CM, is investigated by sintering typical available solid wastes (Fe-S-rich gold tailings and Si-rich marine shellfish powder) as the matrix with copper/cobalt-rich precursors. Analysis results indicate that the precursors (Cobaltate and Cuprate) with the proposed ratio (1:1 by mass, 1300 degrees C) can be chemically stable crystallized in the more durable structure of customized copper/cobalt-rich ferrite spinel-based construction CM (CM-(Cu-Co)Fe2O4). The composite membrane can operate stably and consumes no additional energy. After detailed characterization of the pore structure, the purification treatment of industrial oily wastewater (rejection rate > 99.9), emulsion oily wastewater (rejection rate > 97.9) and alizarin red wastewater (rejection rate > 99.3) was fully evaluated. Surprisingly, the waste-to-resource CM of CM-(Cu-Co)Fe2O4 exhibits significant heavy metal iron ion removal performance (>94%) due to electrostatic attraction and adsorption. The successful preparation and application of environment-oriented multifunctional CM from a typical solid waste matrix provide a promising strategy of resource recovery for beneficial utilization of ordinary solid wastes with stock as ceramic raw materials.

AB Supplementation with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) during in vitro maturation significantly improves the rates of oocyte cleavage and morula and blastocyst formation in sheep and buffalo; however, the mode of action of ALC in improving oocyte competence is not completely understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ALC on proliferation, antioxidant properties, lipid droplet accu-mulation and steroid hormone secretion in yak (Bos grunniens) granulosa cells (GCs). Yak GCs were identified using FSHR immunofluorescence. The cells were treated with different concentrations of ALC, cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8, and the optimal concentration and treatment time were determined for subsequent experiments. Then, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by a DCFH-DA probe, and lipid droplet accumulation was observed by oil red O staining. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in the medium were detected by ELISA, and the expression of genes related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle, antioxidants and steroid synthesis was determined by RT-qPCR. The results showed that 1 mM ALC treatment for 48 h was the optimum treatment. It significantly increased cell viability (P < 0.05), significantly decreased the amount of ROS and lipid droplet content, and promoted P4 and E2 secretion (P < 0.05) of yak GCs. RT-qPCR results verified that GCs treated with 1 mM ALC for 48 h significantly increased the expression of genes related to anti-apoptosis and the cell cycle (BCL-2, PCNA, CCND1 and CCNB1), antioxidants (CAT, SOD2 and GPX1), and E2 and P4 secretion (StAR, CYP19A1 and HSD3B1) (P < 0.05), but it significantly decreased the expression of apoptosis genes (BAX and P53) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALC increased the viability of yak GCs, reduced the amount of ROS and lipid droplets, increased P4 and E2 synthesis and affected the expression of related genes in yak GCs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI Processing methods and the underlying detoxification mechanisms for
   toxic medicinal materials used by ethnic minorities in China: A review

ID PHARMACOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES; RESEARCH PROGRESS; ALKALOIDS; ZUOTAI; HGCL2
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Various toxic medicinal materials have been used by different ethnic minorities in China for thousands of years because of their extraordinary pharmacological activities. However, the improper use and complex toxicity-efficacy relationship could cause poisoning and even death. Therefore, the study of toxicity-attenuating methods and mechanisms is necessary.Aim of the study: This review aims to summarize commonly used toxic ethnomedicines and their processing methods as well as the underlying mechanisms to potentially reduce toxicity and even enhance or preserve ef-ficacy. Prospective for possible future investigations is also discussed.Materials and methods: Processing methods and mechanisms are investigated mainly through literature review.Results: Processing methods with heating (boiling, stir frying, and steaming, etc.) and without heating (soaking) are usually used by Chinese ethnic minorities to attenuate the toxicity of ethnomedicines. Wheat bran, vinegar, wine, and herbal decoction are commonly used processing excipients. The mechanisms of detoxification by processing can be briefly summarized into three major categories: specialIntscript direct elimination of impurities or reduction of toxic constituents' contents of ethnomedicines by cutting, washing, soaking or frosting; specialIntscript chemical structure transformation of toxic constituents, such as alkaloids, glycosides, toxic proteins, animal toxicants, and mineral components, during heating and/or soaking; and specialIntscript biological synergism or antagonism effects between the chemical constituents of processing excipients and ethnomedicines in vivo, to reduce toxicity and protect target organs.Conclusion: Toxic ethnomedicines have long been used in China, and detoxification by processing is the pre-requisite for their safe clinical application. However, understanding on the special processing methods and detoxification mechanisms of ethnomedicines in China remains insufficient. Investigations on quality control of toxic ethnomedicines, as well as evaluation of processing methods and studies of the corresponding mechanisms should be further strengthened for safe and effective clinical application.

AB Exploration of the electrocatalysts with uniformly dispersed metal nanoparticles (NPs) is important to achieve high electrocatalytic activity, but the NPs always trend to aggregate during fabrication or application. Herein, ultrasmall FeMoNi tri-metal NPs was confined by tannic acid-derived carbon layer and utilized as bi-functional electrocatalyst. The interconnected nanosheets network with open porous structure and electrolyte/gas diffusion channels can reduce the mass transfer resistance. The tri-metal NPs with average diameter of only 11.9 nm are uniformly distributed between the space limited carbon interlayer to avoid aggregation and provide enhanced electric conductivity. Meanwhile, the physical carbon armor and electron tunneling effect can enhance the alkali resistance and electrocatalytic activity/stability of the electrocatalyst. Therefore, the optimized C@FeMoNi/CC electrode can achieve overpotential of 244 mV and potential of 1.4 V at 10 mA cm (2) for OER and UOR, respectively, and high long-term cyclic stability for 40 h. Moreover, the high-valence NiFe species are considered as the highly active centers. This plant polyphenol derived surface coating and carbonization strategy with controllable functional building blocks provides a solution for the rational design of energy conversion devices.

TI Positive and negative electrocaloric effect in the direct and indirect
   characterization of NaNbO3-based ceramics with
   tetragonal-cubic phase boundary
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C

DT Article
ID THIN-FILM; TEMPERATURE-RANGE; TRANSITIONS; STABILITY
AB The electrocaloric effect (ECE) in lead-free ferroelectric materials has become a significant issue based on the potential of electrocaloric refrigeration to guide a new generation of coolers. However, although the construction of a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase boundary has been widely performed to optimize the ECE due to the large polarization change, its relative effect on indirect and direct characterization is still not clear to date. Herein, a tetragonal-cubic phase boundary was successfully formed in sodium niobate (NN)-based ceramics, together with a reduced Curie temperature (T-C) and increased relaxor behavior with an increase in composition (x). The maximum electrocaloric temperature change (Delta T-max) and its subsequent operating temperature decreased with an increase in the content of additives, while the temperature span (T-span) gradually increased. Notably, a novel phenomenon of negative electrocaloric temperature change (Delta T) was revealed for indirect characterization around the temperature range for the coexistence of tetragonal and cubic phases, whereas positive values were obtained for direct characterization. This difference originated from the different mechanisms between the indirect and direct methods for the ECE. The negative values were induced by the enhanced polarization with an increase in temperature in the indirect method, originating from the coexistence of a long-range order matrix and a certain amount of polar nanoregions (PNRs), which can promote the polarization rotation under an electric field and overcome the deterioration from thermal disturbance. Nevertheless, the positive values are mainly due to the orientation and re-orientation of the domain with the application and withdrawal of an electric field, yielding a decrease and increase in the degree of disordered polarization during the direct method, respectively. This work is beneficial to optimize the ECE and analyze the internal mechanism of electrocaloric refrigeration.

AB The current study investigated the influence of mixture composition on the biomass yield and early establishment of legume-grass mixtures. The legume species alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. (A)), white clover (Trifolium repens L. (WC)), and red clover (Trifolium pratense L. (RC)) and grass species orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L. (O)), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (TF)), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. (PR)) were grown in monocultures and in different legume-grass mixtures. Legume-grass mixtures (M1: WC + O + TF; M2: A + O + TF; M3: A + WC + O + TF; M4: RC + WC + O + TF; M5: A + WC + O + TF + PR; M6: RC + WC + O + TF + PR; and M7: A + RC + WC + O + TF + PR) were sown in a legume-grass seeding ratio of 3:7. The results showed that M2 had the greatest two-year average biomass yield (12.92 t ha(-1)), which was significantly (p < 0.05), 4.7%, 5.4%, 15.8%, and 29.1% greater than that of WC monoculture, M7, M4, and Ml, respectively. The grass biomass yield proportions of all mixtures significantly decreased, while legume biomass yield proportions significantly increased in the second year compared to the first year of establishment. The land-equivalent ratio values of M2 and M4 were greater than 1 in each cutting period. The competition rate of grasses gradually decreased with prolonged establishment time. Overall, the biomass yield, legume and grass biomass yield proportions, land equivalent ratio, and competition rate data highlighted that M2 is the best choice to achieve greater productivity and early establishment in southwest China.

AB Technological, safety-related and volatile properties were analyzed in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates from Chinese spontaneously fermented meat products. A total of 107 CNS isolates were identified via 16 S rRNA sequencing, and the most recovered species were S. saprophyticus (53.3 %), S. edaphicus (12.1 %), and S. epidermidis (10.3 %). Among them, 58 CNS isolates belonging to 9 species were selected with higher activities of catalase, nitrate reductase, proteolysis, and lipolysis, as well as higher tolerance to stressful environmental conditions. Then, 7 CNS isolates belonging to 4 species were further selected based upon excellent technological characteristics, lack of hemolysis and antibiotic resistance, and a low production of biogenic amines. The volatile profiles of these 7 strains cultivated in pork broth was determined. S. casei No. 1 produced significant amounts of phenethyl alcohol, geraniol, and 3-methyl-butanol. S. xylosus No. 120 produced the highest amount of methyl ketones with the potential to provide dry-cured odor of fermented meats. The volatile profile was highly strain dependent. Several CNS identified in this study have the potential to be used as the starter cultures for fermented meat products.

AB The literature about changes in land use includes many studies of global sustainable development goals, while studies of transport land expansion have been relatively scarce. In this paper, we present an analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of transport land expansion in China's 31 provinces from 2009 to 2017, applying the spatial Dubin model to identify the factors that influenced changes in per capita transport land area (PCTLA). The eastern and western regions have continued to lead the nation in terms of the total area dedicated to transport land. The expansion speed of transport land in the central and western regions, however, has been faster than in the eastern and northeast regions. As for PCTLA, the western region had the greatest amount and the central region the least. Further, PCTLA showed significant spatial autocorrelation. Economic development, government regulations, industrial structure, and the extent of opening up and urbanization had significant positive impacts on PCTLA, while the development of railway freight had a negative impact. This paper concludes with some policy suggestions for optimizing transport investment, accelerating the adjustment of industrial structure and transport structure, and implementing high-quality urbanization. The results should be of interest to those involved in the sustainable development of transport systems.

AB Cats are susceptible to panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) infection. FPV has been recognized as relatively conservative in genetic evolution compared to CPV-2, but information regarding FPV variations in cats is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular prevalence of FPV and CPV-2 variants among cats in China. From April 2019 to December 2021, 193 diarrheal faecal samples of cats were collected from Southwest China and 127 (65.80%) samples tested positive to Carnivore protoparvovirus 1. FPV, CPV-2 and some their genomic variants were identified from positive samples, indicating a heterogeneous Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 circulation in the cat population in China. Among FPV strains, an A91S FPV mutant reached the detection rate of 39.37%, which showed that this FPV genomic variant has been prevalent in the tested cats. Moreover, 7 strains of A91S FPV variants were isolated and purified successfully using F81 cells, and the genomes were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees based on the nearly complete genomic sequences, VP2 and NS1 nucleotide sequences showed that the A91S FPV variants were located in the FPV clade, but all clustered into a separate branch. Structural prediction showed that A91S mutation in VP2 protein extended the random coil of aa residues from 92-95 to 91-95. Moreover, the analysis of all complete VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV-2 available in the GenBank database revealed that the A91S FPV variant has been prevalent in China since 2017 and has reported in four other countries in cats. Thus, our study revealed that heterogeneous Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 are circulating in the cat population in China, and first reported the prevalence and genomic characteristics of the A91S FPV variant, which contributed to a better understanding of the molecular prevalence and genetic evolution of FPV in cats.

AB Quantitative information, such as environmental migration, absorption, biodistribution, biotransformation, and elimination, is fundamental and essential for the nanosafety evaluations of nanomaterials. Due to the complexity of biological and environmental systems, it is challenging to develop quantitative approaches and tools that could characterize intrinsic behaviors of nanomaterials in the organisms. The isotopic tracers are ideal candidates to tune the physical properties of nanomaterials while preserving their chemical properties. In this review article, we summarized the stable isotope labeling methods of nanomaterials for evaluating their environmental and biological effects. The skeleton labeling protocols of carbon nanomaterials and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles were introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of stable isotope labeling were discussed in comparison with other quantitative methods for nanomaterials. The quantitative information of nanomaterials in environmental and biological systems was summarized along with the biosafety data. The benefits for drug development of nanomedicine were analyzed based on the targeting effects, persistent accumulation, and safety. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of stable isotope labeling in nanoscience and nanotechnology were discussed.

AB Palladium (Pd) is supposed to be one of the most promising catalytic metals towards ethanol (C2H5OH) oxidation reaction (EOR). However, Pd electrocatalysts easily suffer from the poisoning of the intermedi-ates (especially CO), resulting in the quick decay of EOR catalysis. Herein, inspired by the Brunsted-Lowry acid-base theory, a "attraction-repulsion" concept is proposed to guide the surface structure engineering toward EOR catalysts. Specifically, we induce Bi(OH)(3) species as Brunsted base onto PdBi nanoplates to effectively repel the adsorption of CO intermediates. The PdBi-Bi(OH)(3) nanoplates show an impressive mass activity of 4.46 A mgPd(-1) during the EOR catalysis and keep excellent stability. Both the stability and enhanced performance are attributed by the interfacial Brunsted base Bi(OH)(3) which can selectively attract and repel reactants and intermediates, as evidenced from in situ measurements and theoretical views.

AB The influence of anion on structure and performance is unclear in potassium sodium niobate ((K,Na)NbO3; KNN)-based ceramics, while cation doping has been widely researched. Here, the phase structure and electrical properties are explored in MnF2-doped KNN ceramics. Significantly, sharp rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) and orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase boundary as well as reduced diffusion degree is exhibited in the ceramics along with little changed phase transition temperatures due to the optimized F- content at O site, which is different from that of cation replacement for A and B sites. Notably, the domain wall motion is facilitated due to the increased A vacancy and decreased O vacancy along with strengthened polarity, originating from the higher valence state and electronegativity of F- with respect to O2-. And then, enhanced ferroelectricity is realized via MnF2 modification, the piezoelectricity is elevated in turn. This work presents a new idea of anion doping for controlling structure and properties in perovskite materials.

AB The gut microbiomes of the host are large and complex communities, which helps to maintain homeostasis, improves digestive efficiency, and promotes the development of the immune system. The small mammals distributed in Sichuan Province are the most popular species for biodiversity research in Southwest China. However, the effects of different diets on the structure and function of the gut microbial community of these small mammals are poorly understood. In this study, whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing has been used to analyze the composition and functional structures of the gut microbiota of seven small mammals in Laojunshan National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Taxonomic classification revealed that the most abundant phyla in the gut of seven small mammals were Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Moreover, Hafnia, Lactobacillus, and Yersinia were the most abundant genus in the gut microbiomes of these seven species. At the functional level, we annotated a series of KEGG functional pathways, six Cazy categories, and 46,163 AROs in the gut microbiomes of the seven species. Comparative analysis found that the difference in the gut microbiomes between the Soricidea and Muridae concentrated on the increase in the F/B (Firmicutes/Bacteroides) ratio in the Soricidea group, probably driven by the high-fat and -calorie digestive requirements due to their insectivorous diet. The comparative functional profiling revealed that functions related to metabolism and carbohydrates were significantly more abundant in Muridae group, which may be attributed to their high carbohydrate digestion requirements caused by their herbivorous diet. These data suggested that different diets in the host may play an important role in shaping the gut microbiota, and lay the foundation for teasing apart the influences of heritable and environmental factors on the evolution of gut microbial communities.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: The species of the genus Cirsium have been used as traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. It is believed that Cirsium has the efficacies of cooling blood and stopping bleeding, dispelling blood stasis, detoxifying and eliminating carbuncle. At present, they are mainly used in treatment of the hemoptysis, hematemesis, hemoptysis, hematuria, traumatic bleeding and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. They are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Aim: This paper systematically collated the classification, traditional use, pharmacological action, phytochemistry and clinical application of Cirsium plants in the past ten years, intending to provide a critical appraisal of current knowledge for future in-depth study and rational development and utilization of Cirsium plants. Material and methods: This paper searched various databases (SciFinder, Science Direct, CNKI, Wiley online library, Spring Link, Web of Science, PubMed, Wanfang Data, Weipu Data), Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020 Edition, Chinese Flora, Chinese Materia Medica and some local books on ethnopharmacology. Results: More than ten species of Cirsium have been used as folk medicine, and modern pharmacological studies have shown that Cirsium has the effects of protecting liver, antioxidation, anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, antibacterial, etc. More than 200 chemical constituents such as flavonoids, triterpenes, sterols, phenylpropanoids have been isolated from Cirsium. Some ingredients show a wide variety of bioactivities including hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor and other activities. At present, Cirsium medicinal plants, as traditional Chinese medicine, were mainly used to treat nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and hemorrhage, although some species used in folk lack of quality control systems. Conclusion: Cirsium plants are a safe and effective medicine for cooling blood and hemostasis. Recent studies on pharmacology and phytochemistry also provide solid scientific evidences for the traditional application of this genus. It also shows significant hepatoprotective activity and may be a potential clinical candidate for the treatment of liver disease. However, the qualitative and quantitative analysis, pharmacokineticspharmacodynamics and mechanism of action also need in-depth study.

AB Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction has been considered as a promising route to realize carbon cyclic utilization and renewable energy storage. Recently, Zn-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to their earth-abundant reserve and low cost, which can meet the demand for commercial applications at a large scale. Herein, ZnO catalyst (ZIF-8-D-ZnO) was synthesized by pyrolysis of ZIF-8 precursor for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. The ZIF-8-D-ZnO catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity for CO production than rod-like ZnO and Zn foil catalysts, with faradaic efficiency of 86.7 % and geometric current density of 16.1 mA cm(-2) at -1.2 V (vs. RHE). Moreover, the overpotential over ZIF-8-D-ZnO is much lower than that of analogous catalysts. The results suggest that the grain boundaries within the porous structure facilitate CO2 electroreduction over ZIF-8-D-ZnO due to the introduction of new catalytically active sites. This work provides experimental evidence for the design of efficient Zn-based materials for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction.

AB Enrofloxacin (ENR), a broad-spectrum antibacterial drug, has extremely poor water solubility contributing to low bioavailability, which prevents drug formulation design and limits its wide application in livestock farming and aquaculture. Compared to conventional formulations of ENR, casein (Cas)-based drug delivery system has been reported to have significant advantages in the improvement of solubility and bioavailability of drugs. In this paper, we report the preparation process of ENR-loaded Cas nanoparticles (ENR-Cas) using magnetic agitation without any organic agent and the optimization of the formulation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were all adopted to characterize the ENR-Cas. Results showed that the obtained ENR-Cas were approximately spherical with a particle size of 171.6 +/- 13.8 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.322 +/- 0.053. In vitro release behavior of ENR-Cas showed a sustained release profile. Additionally, in vivo study in rats displayed that the mean plasma concentration of ENR after oral administration of ENR-Cas was significantly higher than that treated with ENR suspension. The mean residence time (MRT0-24) of ENR was enhanced by Cas nanoparticles from 9.287 +/- 0.524 to 11.372 +/- 1.139 hr in comparison with ENR suspension. Accordingly, the area under the curve (AUC(0-)(24)) of ENR-Cas was 80.521 +/- 6.624 mu g.hr/ml, 3.8-fold higher than that of ENR suspension (20.850 +/- 1.715 mu g-hr/ml). Therefore, it can be concluded that ENR-Cas enhanced the absorption, prolonged the retention time, and improved oral bioavailability of ENR. Taken the good oral safety of Cas into consideration, ENR-Cas should be a more promising oral preparation of ENR for clinical application.

   electrocatalyst for water splitting
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS
LA English
DT Article
AB Designing and preparing multimetallic compounds with special structures and without using any template and shape-directing agent is a challenge. Herein, a nickel-iron-chromium compound/stainless steel foil (NICC/SSF) electrocatalyst with a novel flower-like nanostructure is synthesized by a one-step cathodic electrodeposition method with a sacrificial anode. The as-fabricated NICC/SSF electrode as an earth-abundant and high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits favorable electrocatalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions and specifically requires only small overpotentials of 85 mV and 274 mV for attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The particular vegetative flower-like nanostructures with highly conductive flocculent clusters could promote sufficient exposure of active sites and optimize the electronic configuration, which is beneficial to facilitate the catalytic performance. In consideration of the well-defined bifunctionality, a full alkaline electrolyzer is constructed with two identical NICC/SSF electrodes. Notably, the NICC/SSF two-electrode electrolyzer for water splitting requires a low onset potential of similar to 1.56 V and a cell voltage of 1.60 to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is ascribed to the synergistic interactions between the metal species by metal-metal charge transfer. The presented strategy offers a facile approach for developing efficient, stable, and low-cost electrocatalysts for realizing large-scale water splitting.

AB A novel kobuvirus was found in diarrheal fecal samples of Tibetan sheep using a viral metagenomics approach, and a full kobuvirus genome was successfully obtained by RT-PCR from a diarrheal fecal sample. The full genomic sequence was 8485 nucleotides (nt) in length with a standard picornavirus genome organization. The novel genome shares 62.9% and 77.8% nt homology with Aichivirus D1 genotype strain 1-22-KoV, and Aichivirus D2 genotype strain 2-44-KoV, respectively. According to the species classification criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the new kobuvirus belongs to Aichivirus species D. Interestingly, compared with 2 known Aichivirus D genotype strains, the novel Aichivirus D has unique amino acid substitutions in the 5'untranslated region (-UTR), VP0, VP3, and VP1, with a recombination event in the 2C region.These characteristics make the novel Aichivirus D cluster into an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain may represent a novel genotype in Aichivirus D. Moreover, the novel Aichivirus D was detected in 9.2% (18/195) of the sheep diarrheal fecal samples from 4 farms in 3 counties of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau in China. In addition, full-length VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes were successfully obtained from 12 samples from 4 farms, and phylogenetic analysis based on these genes revealed a unique evolutionary pattern for this novel Aichivirus D strain. This study identified a novel Aichivirus D that is circulating in sheep in Qinghai Tibet Plateau in China and these findings provide a better understanding of the epidemiologic and genetic evolution of kobuviruses.

AB Tumor drainage lymph node imaging is crucial for oncological surgery, where the complete dissection of sentinel lymph nodes could largely prevent/delay recurrence. However, current commercially used imaging reagents distinguish the lymph nodes by staining them dark, which might be seriously interfered with by blood and other tissues. Herein, we reported fluorescent Ag-In-S/ZnS quantum dots (AIS/ZnS QDs) with red emission for fast tumor drainage lymph node imaging. AIS/ZnS QDs were synthesized by solution reaction and then dispersed in poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) for in vivo applications. AIS/ZnS QDs were well dispersed in water with hydrodynamic radii of 295 nm, suitable for lymph node imaging. The fluorescent imaging capability of AIS/ZnS QDs was first established after subcutaneous injection in mice. AIS/ZnS QDs could migrate to sentinel lymph nodes after the interdermal injection to the extremities. Tumor drainage lymph node imaging was achieved within 10 min upon intratumoral injection to H460 tumor-bearing mice. However, intravenous injection did not lead to tumor uptake of AIS/ZnS QDs. The fast and efficient migration of AIS/ZnS QDs into tumor drainage lymph nodes resulted in AIS/ZnS QDs being a high-performance imaging reagent for tumor drainage lymph nodes in vivo.

AB The wetlands on Earth are under different levels of degradation, and over half of them have even been lost during the 20th century. However, the response of soil insect communities to alpine wetland degradation is unknown, particularly in the Zoige? wetland, which spanning northern Sichuan, southern Gansu and Qinghai Provinces of China. Four habitats, including wet meadows, grassland meadows, moderately degraded meadows and severely degraded meadows, were selected in the Zoige? wetland, and the soil insect communities, plant communities and soil properties were investigated from April 2009 to October 2011. Diptera larvae and Coleoptera were the most abundant taxa. The soil insect taxonomic composition in the severely degraded meadows was clearly different from these of the others. The soil insect abundance significantly increased in the grassland meadows and declined in the severely degraded meadows. Similar response was found for the abundance of the Diptera larvae. The taxonomic richness and diversity of the soil insect community declined significantly in the severely degraded meadows, as well as the abundances of Coleoptera larvae and adults. The plant community and soil physico-chemical properties together determined the spatial distributions of the soil insect communities, and the avail-able soil P and K and vegetation height were the main factors that determined the abundances and diversities of the soil insect communities. Our observations demonstrated that the soil insect communities were sensitive to alpine wetland degradation, which suggests that there are drastic changes in ecological function during wetland degradation.

AB The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of betacoronavirus lineage A is a secondary receptor in the infection process and is involved in the emergence of new betacoronavirus genotypes with altered host specificity and tissue tropism. We previously reported a novel recombinant bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strain that was circulating in dairy cattle in China, but this virus was not successfully isolated, and the genetic characteristics of BCoV are still largely unknown. In this study, 20 diarrheic faecal samples were collected from a farm in Liaoning province that had an outbreak of calf diarrhea (<= 3 months of age) in November 2018, and all of the samples tested positive for BCoV by RT-PCR. In addition, a BCoV strain with a recombinant HE (designated as SWUN/A1/2018) and another BCoV strain with a recombinant HE containing an insertion (designated as SWUN/A10/2018) were successfully isolated in cell culture (TCID50: 10(4.25)/mL and 10(4.73)/mL, respectively). Unexpectedly, we identified the emergence of a novel BCoV variant characterized by a 12-nt bovine gene insertion in the receptor-binding domain in a natural recombinant HE gene, suggesting a novel evolutionary pattern in BCoV.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the dose responses of growth performance, immune traits, and small intestinal morphology to dietary supplementation of chromium propionate (CrPro) in heat-stressed broilers. A total of 252 1-day-old Cobb 500 male broilers were randomly assigned to 6 treatments with 7 replicate cages of 6 birds per cage. The dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mg/kg Cr in the form of CrPro. The birds had ad libitum access to feed and tap water for an experimental period of 42 D. For induction of heat stress, the house temperature was set at 35 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C from 22 to 42 D of age. No differences were detected among treatments in growth performance during the experimental period (P>0.05). Serum IgA concentrations were not affected by treatment (P>0.05). However, a quadratic response was detected for serum IgG (P<0.01) and IgM (P<0.01) concentration as dietary Cr supplementation was increased. The highest response of IgG and IgM in serum was observed for broilers fed a diet supplemented with 0.2 mg of Cr/kg. Dietary supplementation of Cr had no impacts on villus height, crypt depth, or the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum and ileum. A quadratic response of villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth and a linear response of crypt depth to increased dietary Cr supplementation were observed in the duodenum (P<0.01). The results indicate that CrPro supplementation could modify the intestinal morphology of the duodenum and influence serum IgG and IgM concentrations in heat-stressed broiler chickens. Based on the results of this experiment, the 0.2-mg Cr/kg diet from CrPro increases immune response and intestinal health in heat-stressed broilers.

AB Yak is the unique Bovidae species in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A previous proteomic study has compared the yak muscle tissue to one cattle strain using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification approach. In this study, to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying yak adaptation, the proteomic profiles of gluteus were compared between yak and one moderate-altitude cattle strain (Tibetan cattle) and two low-altitude cattle strains (Holstein and Sanjiang cattle) using a label-free quantitative method. The comparisons identified 20, 364, 143 upregulated proteins and 4, 6, 37 downregulated proteins in yak, compared with Tibetan, Holstein, and Sanjiang cattle, respectively. Protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly related to "oxidative phosphorylation" and "electron transport chain." Further analysis revealed that NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 11, NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 4, cytochrome C oxidase subunit 6A2, mitochondrial and cytochrome c oxidase subunit NDUFA4 were all increased in the yak, suggesting that yak might increase mitochondrial capacity to sustain metabolic rates under high altitude conditions, which might be a long-term adaptive mechanism underlying adaptation to high altitude environments. Yak increased the level of thioredoxin reductase 2 to protect themselves from oxidative damages. Moreover, the increased expression levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform and caveolin-1 in yak suggested that yaks promoted glucose uptake for adaptation to high altitude. These results provided more information to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying yak adaption.

AB Objective: This study aimed to determine the optimal extraction process and examine whether the combination of Flos Sophorae Immaturus (FSI) and Yupingfeng san (YPS) has a synergistic effect on free radical scavenging capacity.
   Design and methods: The time of immersion and extraction and the ratios (material/solvent) of the combination of YPS and FSI were optimized on the basis of polysaccharide and flavonoid yields via orthogonal design. The optimal result was used in the 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and animal experiments to WA the antioxidant activity, which is reflected by superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity serum levels. The optimal extraction process was determined using various ingredients to obtain complex extracts with high active ingredient content and antioxidant activity. DPPH assay results showed that the optimized ingredients have antioxidant effects, and the combination had better antioxidation function than YPS in vitro. The combination also showed synergistic antioxidant activity compared with YPS in vivo.
   Conclusions: The combination of YPS and FSI had a synergistic antioxidant effect in vitro. The optimized extracts had antioxidant effects in vivo. These results indicated that YPS could be used with FSI to improve its antioxidant capacity in the body on the basis of free radical scavenging capacity.

AB A frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)-catalyzed allylation of allyl alcohols with electron-rich arenes has been developed. Interestingly, in this reaction, the electron-rich arenes and allyl alcohols are dehydrated in water. What's more, water was the sole byproduct of the reaction. In this protocol, various allyl alcohols can be converted into allyl cations and attacked by the electron-rich arenes to form aryl cation intermediates. Finally, the aryl cation intermediates are deprotonated to give the 1,3-diarylpropenes. In this protocol, indole allyl alcohols can undergo a bimolecular ring closure reaction, and structurally diverse tetrahydroindolo[3,2-b]carbazoles could be smoothly obtained. The reaction is not sensitive to oxygen and has been performed on a gram-scale.

AB Macrophages have been reported to participate in inflammation, tissue homeostasis and tissue repair. The detailed mechanism of macrophage-mediated tissue repair is not clear. CXCL-10, secreted by monocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, mediates immune response and angiogenesis by binding to CXCR3. In this study, the expression of CXCL-10 and CXCR3 in porcine lung injury induced by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection was firstly examined. The results showed that the expression of both CXCL-10 and CXCR3 increased in the infected pig lungs. In addition, the increased expression of CXCL-10 and CXCR3 in macrophage treated by poly (I:C) was also observed, suggesting the autocrine system existed in macrophages. Furthermore, CXCL-10 treatment induced upregulation of Arg1 and VEGFa, and downregulation of TNF alpha in macrophage, and CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 treatment presented the contrary effects on the expression of Arg1, VEGFa, and TNF alpha. CXCL10-stimulated effects were dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Wound-healing assay showed that CXCL-10 treatment macrophage conditioned medium promoted the healing process of endothelial cells. Our results suggested that CXCL-10/CXCR3 in macrophage may mediate tissue repair by regulating the macrophage expression of Arg1, VEGFa and TNF alpha. Modulation of CXCL-10/CXCR3 axis in macrophage may be a potential therapeutic strategy for tissue injury and repair.

AB Achieving an optimal operating cost is a challenge for the development of hybrid tramways. In the past few years, in addition to fuel costs, the lifespan of the power source is being increasingly considered as an important factor that influences the operating cost of a tramway. In this work, an optimal energy management strategy based on a multi-mode strategy and optimisation algorithm is described for a high-power fuel cell hybrid tramway. The objective of optimisation is to decrease the operating costs under the conditions of guaranteeing tramway performance. Besides the fuel costs, the replacement cost and initial investment of all power units are also considered in the cost model, which is expressed in economic terms. Using two optimisation algorithms, a multi-population genetic algorithm and an artificial fish swarm algorithm, the hybrid system's power targets for the energy management strategy were acquired using the multi-objective optimisation. The selected case study includes a low-floor light rail vehicle, and experimental validations were performed using a hardware-in-the-loop workbench. The results testify that an optimised energy management strategy can fulfil the operational requirements, reduce the daily operation costs and improve the efficiency of the fuel cell system for a hybrid tramway.

AB GTP binding protein overexpressed in skeletal muscle (GEM) is an important gene with many functions, such as regulating the rearrangement of cytoskeleton and the activity of voltage-dependent calcium channel, and GEM was regarded as a candidate gene for obesity. However, little investigation has been carried out to explore whether GEM affected the intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition of goat. To explore the role of GEM gene in goat, this gene was cloned and its tissue and temporal expression profile were detected. Effect of GEM on adipogenesis was examined by losing function of GEM in vitro. Thereafter, several lipid metabolism-related genes were examined, including CCAAT/enhancing-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), CCAAT/enhancing-binding protein beta (C/EBP beta), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). We found that the goat GEM gene consisted of 936 bp, which encoded a protein of 311 amino acids. The expression of GEM was higher in spleen, lung and large intestine and it appeared sharp in the interim stage of differentiation. Furthermore, GEM knockdown blocked adipogenesis and the expression of C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, LPL, PPAR gamma and SREBP1. These results indicated that GEM might promote lipid accumulation and adipogenesis.

AB With the development of information technology, people are likely to choose products through online-shopping platform as it's so convenient to select products based on their reviews. Even for popular products, thousands of reviews are posted on e-commerce sites. That makes it difficult for online consumers to make purchasing decisions based on all the reviews. In order to help consumers make purchase decisions, it is a valuable research topic to rank the products through products' information. For the purpose of obtaining more objective and accurate order of products, in this paper, we propose a prospect theory-based method to rank the products by integrating online product scores and objective data. Alternative products are obtained according to the customers' basic product requirements. Then, online scores and objective values of alternative products based on multiple criteria are collected and fused after the normalisation procedure. Finally, we get the ranking of alternative products according to the weighted prospect values of alternative products based on multi-criteria. An example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The characteristics and advantages of this method are illustrated by comparison and experiments. Using the richer information of products by integrating the subjective and objective information is a new idea in information representation of products. Besides, it is also more in line with the actual buying situation by means of considering buyers' risk attitudes.

AB As hazardous waste can cause significant environmental damage, many countries have promulgated strict laws on hazardous waste disposal to protect human and ecological health and reduce environmental damage and environmental disaster risk. As China produces significant hazardous waste, centralized treatment is vital, for which production-distribution decisions play a key role. However, as there have been few studies on production-distribution decisions for centralized hazardous waste treatment, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines bi-level multi-objective programming with an artificial bee colony algorithm to optimize environmental risk reduction-oriented decision making for hazardous waste production distribution in China, in which both the decision hierarchies and uncertain variables are considered. A numerical experiment is then given to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, from which it was found that the proposed approach was able to give effective production-distribution decision support, improve hazardous waste treatment efficiency, and reduce environmental disaster risk.

AB Zn0.975-xNaxF0.025O nanocrystals have been successfully fabricated via a modified polymer-network gel procedure. A clear relationship is observed between the photocatalytic characteristics of the nanocrystals and their photoluminescence. The ZnO features are easily tuned by adjusting the Na concentration, as confirmed by XRD and SEM, indicating that the hexagonal wurtzite structure is not affected by codoping. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity increases with doped Na concentration at room temperature, but becomes weak at Na concentrations of 2.5%similar to 5%. The optimal doped Na concentration is approximately 2.5%, which yields excellent photocatalytic activity in the nanocrystals. This can be attributed to increased acceptor-related defects, which are evidenced by the PL measurement. These defects create a barrier for photogenerated carrier recombination.

AB A series of binary g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 hybrid photocatalysts with different ratios of g-C3N4 were successfully prepared using a facile hydrothermal method. The composition, structure, and optical properties of the obtained g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 composite photocatalysts were characterized by various analytical techniques including infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared samples were evaluated in the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under visible light irradiation. Among all the tested catalysts, 1:15-g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 nanocomposite displays the highest photocatalytic activity with the optimal rate constant of 0.0414 min(-1) due to the high surface area and the improvement of visible light absorbing capacity. The composite also shows good photostability and reusability after five cyclic experiments. Different scavengers such as citric acid, oxalic acid, and isopropanol were used to systematically investigate their effect on Cr(VI) photoreduction. Appropriate concentrations of citric acid and oxalic acid have positive effect to improve the photocatalytic activity by consuming photo-induced electrons to minimize the rate of electron-hole recombination, but excessive citric acid and oxalic acid are harmful to the photoreduction. A possible mechanism for Cr(VI) photoreduction by g-C3N4/Bi2WO6 composite was proposed.

AB To coordinate multiple power sources properly, this paper presents an optimal control strategy for a fuel cell/battery/supercapacitor light rail vehicle. The proposed strategy, which uses the firefly algorithm to optimize the equivalent consumption minimization strategy, improves the drawback that the conventional equivalent consumption minimization strategy takes insufficient account of the global performance for the vehicle. Moreover, the strategy considers the difference between the two sets of optimized variables. The optimization objective is to minimize the daily operating cost of the vehicle, which includes the total fuel consumption, initial investment, and cycling costs of power sources. The selected case study is a 100% low-floor light rail vehicle. The advantages of the proposed strategy are investigated by comparison with the operating mode control, firefly algorithm-based operating mode control, and equivalent consumption minimization strategy. In contrast to other methods, the proposed strategy shows cost reductions of up to 39.62% (from operating mode control), 18.28% (from firefly algorithm-based operating mode control), and 13.81% (from equivalent consumption minimization strategy). In addition, the proposed strategy can reduce fuel consumption and increase the efficiency of the fuel cell system.

AB Genotype G9 is an emerging genotype among species A rotavirus (RVA) circulating in humans and pigs worldwide. In this study, an RVA strain designated RVA/Dog-tc/CHN/SCCD-A/2017/G9P[23] was isolated in cell culture from a pet dog stool sample with acute diarrhea, and its whole genome was sequenced. The genotype constellation of SCCD-A was G9-P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. All genome segments except the VP1 gene were closely related to the genes from porcine RVA strains or porcine-like human RVA strains. On the other hand, the VP1 gene clustered in a distinct lineage only with that of a G5P[6] porcine-like human RVA, preventing the identification of the exact host species origin, but very unlikely to be originated from human RVA. In addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that the G9 VP7 gene of SCCD-A clustered into a novel sublineage within the lineage III of G9. This first isolation of a G9P[23] RVA from a pet dog may justify the exploration of the role dogs play in the interaction of RVA circulating in pigs and humans.

AB This paper investigates the sampled-data consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems via new event-based control. Both the leaderless and leader-following consensus problems are considered. Different from the existing results, the state information is assumed to be unknown for each following agent and only the relative output information between neighbouring agents can be measured. A new Kx-functional observer-based output feedback event-based protocol is designed, which may have lower dimension than the full-order and reduced-order observer. The improved event-based condition bounds each agent's measurement error by a time-dependent threshold. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is excluded by showing that the inter-event time between any two triggering events is lower bounded by a strictly positive value. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.

AB A suitable interlayer thickness is critical to reduce film mismatch and roughness. In this text, diamond-like carbon (DLC) films with different SiNx interlayer thicknesses were successfully synthesized on Si (100) substrates by radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering method. The effect of SiNx interlayer thickness on surface morphology, adhesion, tribological and mechanical properties of DLC films was investigated. The results show that, due to the use of SiNx interlayer in the DLC films, the adhesion is significantly enhanced, the surface roughness is increased, and the spa content and modulus are lowered. When the SiNx interlayer is introduced, the intemal stress and the roughness decrease first decrease and then increase. The reason may be related to the accumulation of nitrogen vacancy centers (NVC). A sample of about 10 nm SiNx interlayer was found to have the best combination of tribology, mechanical properties, and surface roughness.

AB There are three distinct patterns of migration among Chinese migrant children: whole-family, single-parent-first, and both-parents-first migration. This study investigated the life satisfaction of children who migrated under the different migration patterns and examined the mediating role of family functioning in the relationship between the children's migration patterns and their life satisfaction. Participants consisted of migrant children (N = 703) from primary and junior middle schools in Chengdu, China. The results showed that (a) migrant children from the whole-family and single-parent-first patterns of migration reported greater life satisfaction than did those from the both-parents-first pattern, and (b) family functioning partially mediated the association between migration patterns and life satisfaction. The present study highlights the importance of avoiding separation of children from both parents during migration and the need to develop interventions for migrant children's psychological adaptation by improving their families' functioning.

AB A Highly efficient route for the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted acetylene derivatives has been developed by palladium catalyzed cross-couplings of alkynyl halides with (hetero)aryl aluminium reagents under mild conditions. This has given corresponding cross-coupling products good to excellent isolated yields of up to 99%. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in either alkynylhatides or arylaluminum substrates gave cross-coupling products good yields. This process was simple and easily performed, which provides an efficient method for the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted acetylenes derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular orientation and dynamic modulus of the high and low temperature drawn polycarbonate splines were investigated using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). For high temperature stretched splines, the storage modulus in the glassy state and the loss modulus in the rubbery state increased with increasing the orientation. No obvious regularity was observed for the low-temperature stretched ones. These behaviors could be interpreted by a relation between relaxation modulus and average orientation angle, which was derived from the elastic dumbbell model and wormlike chain model. Through associating the molecular orientation defined by Herman's factor with the storage modulus at the end of the glassy state plateau and the loss modulus at the tans peak respectively, the relationship between orientation and dynamic viscoelasticity of polycarbonate was built as well.

AB Contents microRNA (miRNA) and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) are two classes small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play crucial roles in multiple biological processes such as spermatogenesis. However, there are no published studies on conjoint analysis of miRNA and piRNA profiles among cattle, yak and their interspecies (the dzo) using sequencing technology. Next-generation sequencing technology was used to profile miRNAs and piRNAs among those three ruminants to elucidate their functions. A total of 119, 14 and six differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained in cattle vs. dzo, cattle vs. yak and yak vs. dzo comparison groups, while there were 873, 1,065 and 1,158 differentially expressed piRNAs in those three comparison groups. The expression of three miRNAs was validated in the three ruminants, and the results suggested that the miRNA expression profiles data could represent actual miRNA expression levels. Moreover, the putative targets of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by their own genome, it is worth to note that both the cattle and yak genome were used for dzo, then the targets were subjected to GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, revealing the likely roles for these differentially expressed miRNAs in spermatogenesis. In conclusion, this study provided a useful resource for further elucidation of the miRNAs and piRNAs regulatory roles in spermatogenesis. It may also facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for dzo reproduction research.

AB Phase-control precision is important for applications of magnetrons in the microwave source array. Here, experimental results use a 20-kW S-band continuous-wave magnetron to investigate the phase deviation of large-power phaselocked magnetrons. For the first time, the phase deviation of a 20-kW magnetron controlled through an externally injected signal was studied. The phase deviation of the injection-locked magnetron output worsened gradually, the greater the difference in frequency of the injected signal (with the same injection ratio) from the center of magnetron injection-locked bandwidth was. When the injected power was maintained at 150 W and the magnetron output was at 19 kW, the maximum phase deviation was varied from approximately 1 degrees to 6 degrees with frequency tuning. In addition, the phase deviation of the phase-locked magnetron decreased as the injected signal power increased at a given frequency.

AB The explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a highly toxic pollutant. Biodegradation is inevitably one of the most cost-effective and enviromentally friendly means of removing TNT pollution. However, the aromatic derivatives from the reduction of nitro groups by several classic enzymes are still toxic. Besides the reduction of nitro groups, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) offers a potential route to ring fission and complete degradation of TNT through the pathway of the Meisenheimer complex. This work is devoted to deeply understand the essence of the Meisenheimer pathway and mainly focus on the crucial hydrogen-transfer reaction by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We obtain three valuable findings. Firstly, the parallel pi-pi TC stacking between TNT and the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor is a precondition. The key residue controlling this conformation is His181. Although His184 does not interact with TNT, the mutation from His184 to Asn184 would abolish the pi-pi structure. Secondly, the data of the empirical valence bond (EVB) show that the Meisenheimer pathway is predominant because its activation barrier is 6.7 kcal mol(-1) far less than that of nitro reduction (26.6 kcal mal(-1)). Finally, based on the results of thermodynamic integration (TI), the type of transferred hydrogen is also ensured, that is, the H anion (H ) for the Meisenheimer complex and the H radical (H-center dot) for nitro reduction. Our findings provide an exhaustive understanding for the first hydrogen transfer reaction that has a decisive effect on two competing pathways, and help in searching for and designing new enzymes that can effectively degrade TNT.

AB Pomegranate seed oil (PSO) is primarily composed of unsaturated fatty acids, implying its potential application as a transdermal enhancer. In this study, the function of PSO in prompting the percutaneous absorption of resveratrol was examined and compared with isopropyl palmitate (IP). IP of 10% enhanced the cumulative permeation amount of resveratrol by 50% but did not influence the permeation velocity. Though 2.5% and 5.0% IP accelerated the penetration process of resveratrol, they had no discernable impact on total permeation amount. In contrast, the cumulative percutaneous amount of the drug with 2.5%, 5.0% and 10% PSO was 1.25, 2.25, and 3.14-fold that of resveratrol alone, respectively. Moreover, PSO of different concentrations speeded up resveratrol to permeate through skin in the whole process, exhibiting its superior capacity over IP in enhancing the transdermal absorption of resveratrol. IP of 2.5% substantially augmented resveratrol retention in stratum corneum (SC), epidermis, and dermis (p < 0.05) while 2.5% PSO only increased the drug detaining in SC. Involvement of oils also aided in resveratrol diffusion within skin. The study demonstrates that both IP and PSO prompted the percutaneous transport of resveratrol. PSO presents more promising opportunities in serving as a percutaneous enhancer for transdermal preparations.

AB Systems in real world are always subject to perturbations. This paper addresses the convergence properties of a class of nominal systems with perturbations. It is assumed that the nominal system is a switched nonlinear exponentially stable one with time-varying delays and that the perturbation exponentially or asymptotically converges to zero. It is revealed that the trajectories of the perturbed system behave as the perturbation, ie, trajectories exponentially or asymptotically converge to zero, depending on the property of perturbation. Applying these results to cascade switched nonlinear systems, it is shown that such systems are exponentially stable if and only if all the subsystems, obtained by removing the coupling terms, are exponentially stable. A similar conclusion is presented for systems being asymptotically stable. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the proposed theoretical results.

AB Background/Aims: Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is an inflammatory cytokine produced mainly by macrophages within human white adipose tissue. Its expression is increased in obese subjects and positively correlated with insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to characterize the regulatory role of AIF-1 in insulin signaling of adipocyte. Methods: AIF-1 was over-expressed via transfection of AIF-1 cDNA into murine RAW 264.7 macrophages, and the constitutive expression of AIF-1 was decreased via transfection of targeting siRNA. Murine 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with macrophage-conditioned medium or AIF-1 protein. Intracellular lipid accumulation was assayed by oil red O stain. Reactive oxygen species production was determinated by a flow cytometer and adipokine secretion was measured with ELISA. Glucose uptake was detected using the glucose oxidase method and insulinsignal- transduction related molecules were analyzed by Western blot. Results: Short term (48 h) AIF-1 treatment slightly promoted intracellular lipid storage in differentiating 3T3L1 cells. The protein stimulated reactive oxygen species production, provoked TNF alpha, IL6, resistin, but suppressed adiponectin release and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake both under normal basal and insulin resistance conditions. Furthermore, AIF-1 induced NF-kappa B activation, inhibited PPAR. expression, GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane and Akt phosphorylation. Conclusion: Macrophage-derived AIF-1 up-regulated reactive oxygen species production, adipokine TNF alpha, IL6, resistin release, and inhibited adiponectin secretion. Moreover, it suppressed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by down-regulating insulin signaling. Thus, AIF-1 could be related to obesity-related diseases. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

AB This paper addresses the stability criteria of nonlinear perturbed T-S fuzzy system in the appearance of distributed delay and time-varying discrete delay simultaneously. A delay partitioning method is used to separate the time-varying delay interval into multiple subintervals equivalently. Meanwhile, integral partitioning method is employed to deal with the distributed delays by dividing the distributed delay [0 d] into L different segments. In order to improve the stability conditions, a new form of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is presented in terms of the delay partitioning methods, which is compounded of the augmented factors related to each delay subintervals. Moreover, recently developed free-matrix-based integral inequality and extended reciprocal convex combination are applied to avoid the overabundance of the enlargement when dealing with the derivative of the LKF. Then, much less conservative stability criteria are presented. At the end, numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

AB Objectives: To systematically review the impact of Yasmin (drospirenone pill) compares with other standard treatments for symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
   Study design: The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials in women with PCOS treated with drospirenone were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted.
   Results: Eighteen articles were included. Compared with drospirenone (DRSP) monotherapy, DRSP plus metformin was better in reducing body mass index (BMI), luteinizing hormone (LH) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Compared with metformin, DRSP was better in modulating serum total testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and free androgen index (FAI), while metformin was more effective in reducing BMI, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and Triglyceride (TG). DRSP was superior to cyproterone acetate (CPA) in reducing TC and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). DRSP shows better effect in modulating LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with desogestrel (DSG).
   Conclusions: The available data suggested that DRSP was effective in modulating hormones, insulin and lipid metabolism in women with PCOS. Compared with commonly used drugs for symptoms of PCOS as CPA and DSG, DRSP shows identical or better effect in improving symptoms and protect cardiovascular system. For the PCOS patients with IR, obesity or high LH/FSH ratio, DRSP combines with metformin maybe more effective than use DRSP alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Being a low-cost, mass-production-compatible route to attain crystalline silicon, post-deposition crystallization of amorphous silicon has received intensive research interest. Here we report a low-temperature (300 degrees C), rapid (crystallization rate of similar to 17 nm/min) means of a-Si: H crystallization based on high-density hydrogen plasma. A model integrating the three processes of hydrogen insertion, etching, and diffusion, which jointly determined the hydrogenation depth of the excess hydrogen into the treated micrometer thick a-Si: H, is proposed to elucidate the hydrogenation depth evolution and the crystallization mechanism. The effective temperature deduced from the hydrogen diffusion coefficient is far beyond the substrate temperature of 300 degrees C, which implies additional driving forces for crystallization, i.e., the chemical annealing/plasma heating and the high plasma sheath electric field. The features of LFICP (low-frequency inductively coupled plasma) and LFICP-grown a-Si: H are also briefly discussed to reveal the underlying mechanism of rapid crystallization at low temperatures.

AB A series of spherical LiNi0.8Co0.15Ti0.05O2 cathode materials were synthesized through co-oxidation-controlled crystallization method followed by solid-state reaction at different calcination temperatures under oxygen flowing. The crystal structure and particles morphology of the as-prepared powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. All samples correspond to the layered alpha-NaFeO2 structure with R-3m space group. The LiNi0.8Co0.15Ti0.05O2 prepared at 800 degrees C presents a better hexagonal ordering structure and better spherical particles and possesses a high tap density of 3.22 g cm(-3). Meanwhile, the NCT-2 sample exhibits an advanced electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 174.2 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of 86.7 % after 30 cycles at 0.2 C.

AB Although several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have been conducted in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the brain structural abnormalities in OCD, especially in children, are not yet well characterized. We aimed to identify gray matter (GM) abnormalities in the early stage of pediatric OCD and examine the relationship between these structural abnormalities with clinical characteristics. Examinations of 30 first-episode, treatment-naive pediatric OCD patients without any comorbidities and 30 matched healthy controls (HCs) were performed with 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) following Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) was used to conduct voxel-wise tests for group differences in regional gray matter volume (GMV). Compared to HCs, the patient group exhibited more GMV in the bilateral putamen and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and less GMV in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The GMV alternation in the right putamen of OCD patients was positively correlated with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores, while the GMV alternation in the left IPL exhibited a trend to negatively correlate with HAM-A scores. Our current results suggest that the GM abnormalities were defined in the early stage of pediatric OCD. Moreover, these findings provided further evidence of brain GM abnormalities that are not only present in the classical fronto-striatal-thalamic circuit but also in the default mode network (DMN), which may represent the interaction of abnormally functional organization of both network in pediatric OCD.

AB Limited understanding of the redistribution of soil and soil organic C (SOC) within landscapes and their corresponding delivery ratios is available. To improve this assignment, the beryllium-7 (Be-7) technique and a simple conversion model were used to estimate soil and SOC redistribution rates on a sloping cropland plot (5 m wide and 15 m long with a slope of 10 degrees) in the hilly red soil region of southern China. Results showed that the soil erosion and deposition rates were relatively consistent with the magnitude of a rainfall event, and the estimated net soil and SOC losses were close to the measured values. These findings suggested the potential of Be-7 measurements in quantifying soil and SOC redistribution patterns associated with short-term erosion from heavy rainfalls. The spatial redistribution patterns of soil and SOC presented alternating erosion-deposition patterns from the slope crest to the bottom. Heavy erosion occurred in the upper-and lower-middle regions of the slope. The estimated net soil and SOC loss were 1.14 kg m(-2) and 23.00 g m(-2) for tillage from spring to summer (S-S, March-July 2013), clearly exceeding the soil (0.017 kg m(-2)) and SOC loss (0.43 g m(-2)) observed for no tillage from summer to winter (S-W, July 2013-January 2014). The sediment delivery rates in the two periods were calculated to be 64.41 and 2.51%, respectively, and the SOC delivery rates were estimated to be 58.17 and 6.48%, respectively. Depending on the weather conditions, tillage can result in a substantial increase in soil and SOC loss under traditional land use.

AB In this work, three amino acid-based cationic lipids L1-L3 bearing the same alpha-tocopherol moiety and biodegradable ester bond linkage, but differing in the polar head-group, were prepared and applied as non-viral gene delivery vectors. The physicochemical properties such as size, zeta-potential, stability, and cellular uptake of the lipoplexes formed from lipids L1-L3 as well as the transfection efficacy (TE) were investigated. The results showed that the chemical composition of the cationic head-group clearly affects the physicochemical parameters of the amino acid-based lipids, especially the TE. Besides their low cytotoxicity, these lipoplexes also showed comparable TE to commercially available lipofectamine 2000. In particular, dipeptide lipid L3 gave excellent TE, which was 1.8 times higher than bPEI 25k in the presence of 10% serum in Hela cells. These results demonstrate the promising use of novel dipeptide lipids for safe and efficient gene delivery.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum Zhao (LF-Zhao) on activated carbon-induced constipation in ICR mice. ICR mice were administered lactic acid bacteria by gavage for 9 d. Body weight, diet intake, drinking amount, stool status, gastrointestinal transit distance and stool time, in addition to motilin (MTL), gastrin (Gas), endothelin (ET), somatostatin (SS), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in serum were monitored to evaluate the preventive effects of LF-Zhao on constipation. Bisacodyl, a laxative drug, was used as a positive control. Times to the first black stool for normal (untreated), control (no lactic acid bacteria treatment but activated carbon treated), bisacodyl-treated and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB), LF-Zhao (L) (low concentration of 1x10(8) CFU/mL)- and LF-Zhao (H) (high concentration of 1 x 10(9) CFU/mL)-treated mice induced by activated carbon were 90, 218, 117, 180, 169 and 156 mm, respectively. Following the consumption of LB, LF-Zhao (L) and LF-Zhao (H) or the oral administration of bisacodyl, the gastrointestinal transit distances were reduced by 55.2%, 61.3%, 70.6% and 94.6%, respectively. The serum levels of MTL, Gas, ET, AChE, SP and VIP were significantly increased and the serum levels of SS were reduced in the mice treated with LF-Zhao compared with those in the control mice (p<0.05). These results demonstrated that lactic acid bacteria demonstrate preventive effects on mouse constipation and that LF-Zhao alleviated constipation symptoms better than LB.

AB With the growing scarcity of worldwide energy and freshwater resources, utilizing abundant seawater for hydrogen production via electrolysis has become imperative. However, due to the multi-electron intermediate process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the competition reaction/erosion from Cl-, the design of highly selective and corrosion-resistant seawater electrocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, Ce-decorated NiFe LDH nanosheets array anchored on vertically aligned CuO nanowire (CeNiFe@CuO) is fabricated by one-step electrodeposition strategy, where Ce doping increases the Lewis acidity and crystal imperfection degree of the composite. The CeNiFe@CuO can achieve high current density of 500 mA cm-2 with overpotential of 265 and 280 mV in KOH and alkaline natural seawater, respectively, and remain stable for 300 h at 500 mA cm-2 in alkaline seawater without apparent corrosion. Systematic experiments and mechanism analysis confirm that the excellent OER activity can be attributed to the introduction of Ce species, which bring massive oxygen vacancies and accelerate the Ni component oxidation rate. Moreover, the CeNiFe@CuO exhibits enhanced surface OH- adsorption kinetics and capacity, resulting in electrostatic exclusion of Cl- to achieve high OER stability and selectivity. This study provides new insights into the development of efficient corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for high-current seawater electrolysis.

AB Electro-Fenton (EF) technology is highly effective for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater. The in-situ generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its subsequent conversion process are pivotal to the efficiency of the EF process, yet these aspects are frequently neglected. Here, we presented a comprehensive review to summarize advancements in the two pivotal steps of the EF process, including the twoelectron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- ORR) to H2O2 and its subsequent conversion to center dot OH. We begin by introducing the mechanism of 2e- ORR to H2O2, highlighting the essential role of intermediate (*OOH) transform and oxygen (O2) adsorption. We then presented the indicators for evaluating the selectivity of H2O2 production, including onset potential, molar efficiency, Faraday efficiency, and electron transfer number. Furthermore, we summarized the recent advances aimed at enhancing H2O2 selectivity via catalyst design and surface and interface engineering. Simultaneously, we delineated the Fe-based Harber-Weiss cycle of H2O2 to center dot OH and the nonmetal 3e- ORR process, elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of the EF process. Specifically, they were categorized into three types: in-situ EF, ex-situ EF, and non-metal EF. Subsequently, The key operational parameters of the EF process and a comparative analysis with other Fenton-like systems are considered as cost assessments. In conclusion, in-situ monitoring of the 2e- ORR process, electrode repair technology, and the development and application of advanced electrode materials are the prospects for EF application.

AB This study addresses the frequency control problem in multiarea power systems through the design of a decentralized periodic event-triggered scheme (DPETS). Initially, a unified discrete-time multiarea model is developed for power systems by adopting the general discretization method. Subsequently, a discrete-type DPETS is designed, relying solely on the locally available area control error to determine the time instants for transmitting the control signal to the equivalent generating unit. Furthermore, the ultimate boundedness of power systems under time-varying load demand disturbance is demonstrated by constructing novel discrete-time Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, leading to a rigorous bound of ultimate states. Finally, a case study involving three-area interconnected power systems is presented to validate the feasibility of the designed control strategy.

AB Untargeted flavoromics and targeted quantitative analysis of key aroma compounds, and analysis of dynamic change of aroma precursors concentration were used to investigate the aroma evolution of traditional braised pork and the underlying mechanism. The results indicated that lipid oxidation dominated at early cooking stage (0th-45th min), resulting in an increased concentration of most aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, such as hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-octenal, benzaldehyde, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione, accompanied with an enhanced unpleasant fatty odor. From 45th to 73rd min, the seasonings alleviated excessive oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids accompanied with decreased aldehydes. Moreover, the diffusion of glucose and amino acids from seasonings to lean meat promoted the consumption of endogenous ribose and amino acids in meat through Maillard reaction, and facilitated the formation of dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methanethiol, and 2-furfural, which contributed to the meaty, sauce-like, and sweety aroma, thus formed the characteristic aroma of traditional braised pork.

AB The ferrous species (Fe(II))-periodate (PI) system employs efficient decontamination by generating ferryl species (Fe(IV)-oxo) under acidic pH conditions. However, the mechanisms by which the Fe(II)/PI system operates across a broad pH range remain elusive. In light of the rapid oxidation and consumption of Fe(II) at neutral pH, we developed an electro-Fe(II) system utilizing an iron plate anode to activate PI (E(Fe/C)/PI). Efficient sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation was achieved under the E(Fe/C)/PI system across a range of pH values. Quenching and chemical probe experiments revealed a transition from Fe(IV)-oxo to singlet oxygen (1O2) 1 O 2 ) as the predominant reactive species from acidic to near-neutral pH, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the differences in one-electron transfer capacity and hydrolysis pathways for various protonated Fe(IV)-oxo species underlie the variations in catalytic mechanisms. This study not only enhances the efficiency of the Fe(II)/PI system but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the activation mechanisms at different pH levels.

AB The optimization of hydrogel structure is crucial for adsorption capacity, mechanical stability, and reusability. Herein, a chitosan and laponite-XLS co-doped poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide) co-acrylamide) hydrogel (CXAA) with honeycomb-like porous structures is synthesized by cooperative cross-linking of 2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (HACC) and laponite-XLS in reticular frameworks of acrylic acid (AAc) and acrylamide (AM). The CXAA exhibits extraordinary mechanical performances including tough tensile strength (3.36 MPa) and elasticity (2756 %), which facilitates recycling in practical adsorption treatment and broadens potential applications. Since the regular porous structures can fully expose numerous adsorption sites and electronegative natures within polymer materials, CXAA displays efficient and selective adsorption properties for cationic dyes like methylene blue (MB) and malachite green (MG) from mixed pollutants and can reach record- high values (MB = 6886 mg g- 1 , MG = 11,381 mg g- 1 ) compared with previously reported adsorbents. Therefore, CXAA exhibits promising potential for separating cationic and anionic dyes by their charge disparities. Mechanism studies show that the synergistic effects of HACC, laponite-XLS, and functional groups in monomers promote highly efficient adsorption. Besides, the adsorption capacity of CXAA remains stable even after undergoing five cycles of regeneration. The results confirm that CXAA is a promising adsorbent for effectively removing organic dyes in wastewater.

AB Photocatalytic water splitting represents a sustainable avenue for hydrogen production, yet the traditional trialand -error approach for identifying efficient photocatalysts among numerous candidates is cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) -driven approach for rapid screening of promising metal oxide photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. This methodology comprises three key steps: the construction of a comprehensive material library, ML -accelerated material screening, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for verification. Through this process, we successfully identify ten metal oxides with good energy levels and charge carrier transport properties from an initial library of 860 candidates. Notably, CsYO 2 emerges as a standout candidate, exhibiting excellent photocatalytic water -splitting performance on its (001) crystal face, with Y atoms identified as active sites through DFT calculations. This study demonstrates the efficacy of applying machine learning to the precise and rapid screening of vast material databases, paving the way for discovering novel and efficient photocatalysts.

AB Simple Summary Simple Summary: Lycium barbarum (Wolfberry) extract is predominantly utilized in livestock and poultry applications. However, the impact of unprocessed branches and leaves of Lycium barbarum as a roughage source on ruminant growth performance, slaughter metrics, and rumen micro-organisms remains not well understood. This investigation examines the effects of incorporating Lycium barbarum branches and leaves into the diet of Hu sheep, specifically assessing growth performance, slaughter results, and meat quality through feeding trials and slaughter tests. Additionally, this study explored the impact on rumen microflora by utilizing 16S rDNA sequencing technology. Findings indicated that diet inclusion of Lycium barbarum branches and leaves could enhance nutrient absorption, which in turn improves growth performance and certain aspects of meat quality. The Lycium barbarum branches and leaves (LBL) are known to contain a range of active substances that have positive effects on animal immunity and antioxidation. This study aimed to examine how LBL impacts the growth and slaughter performance as well as rumen fermentation and microbiota in Hu sheep. A total of 50 male Hu sheep of indigenous origin, aged 3 months, were randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 sheep each. The groups were given different levels of LBL supplementation (0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) to evaluate growth performance and nutrient apparent digestibility. Rumen fluid samples were collected for analysis of the fermentation parameters and rumen chyme was examined to study the rumen microbiota. The slaughter performance, meat quality, and organ index were evaluated at the conclusion of the experiment. The results showed that the final body weight and average daily gain of the LBL1 group were significantly higher than those of the CON group, LBL3 group, and LBL4 group (p < 0.05). The average dry matter intake of the LBL4 group was significantly lower than that of other experimental groups (p < 0.05). The apparent digestibility of CP in the LBL1 and LBL2 groups was higher than that in other experimental groups (p < 0.05). At the same time, the eye muscle area and grade-rule (GR) value of Hu sheep in the LBL1 group significantly increased and the quality of Hu sheep meat improved (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in organ weight and organ index between the experimental groups (p > 0.05). The pH of the rumen fluid in the LBL1 group was significantly lower than that in the CON group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the NH3-N content between the experimental groups (p > 0.05). The propionate and valerate in the rumen fluid of Hu sheep in the LBL2 group were significantly higher than those in other experimental groups (p < 0.05). In addition, this had no significant effect on the structure and abundance of the rumen microbiota (p > 0.05). LBL is a promising functional feed. Adding an appropriate amount of LBL to the diet can improve the feed efficiency, growth performance, and meat quality of Hu sheep but has no adverse effects on the rumen. In this experiment, the appropriate supplemental level of LBL in the diet was 3%.

AB Accurate prediction of indoor thermal environments and heating energy consumption is crucial to building energy efficiency. However, plateau areas pose unique challenges with high altitude, low ambient temperatures, pronounced atmospheric transparency and intense solar radiation. Classical thermal modelling methods or handy building simulation software are mainly based on more common and less elevated zones, regardless of these distinct climatic attributes, leading to disparities or errors in load prediction and energy efficiency evaluation. To address this, an improved "white box" dynamic building thermal model is proposed to forecast indoor thermal environment and heating consumption specifically designed for passive solar buildings. This advanced model isolates and analyzes the precise influence of solar radiation while elucidating the fundamental principles governing building thermal processes. Moreover, a prototypical building and experiment system for on -site testing are established, enabling the assessment or real-time thermal responses and temperature variations. Validation results demonstrate that the proposed model shows acceptable accuracy, validated against fieldmeasured data, showcasing robust reliability with coefficients of variation below 30 %. Furthermore, the preliminary results also show that impact factors related to solar radiation, such as window-to-wall ratios, building orientations, and heat transfer coefficients, have more significant influence for heating energy consumption in plateau buildings. This study contributes the theoretical and methodological underpinnings to enhance building thermal design and improve heating energy efficiency improvement in high-altitude plateau areas.

AB Polydopamine-based coating catalysts have garnered increasing attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, we developed a novel immobilized palladium (Pd) catalyst by incorporating polydopamine (PDA) spheres for efficient catalyze Carbon -Carbon coupling reaction. The Pd/PDA-X and Pd/PDA-IP catalysts were thoroughly characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming the successful preparation of polydopamine spheres. Furthermore, high -resolution TEM analysis revealed that the palladium particles in these catalysts maintained highly dispersion. Notably, the apparent activation energy for the initial Heck reaction was significantly lower for the Pd/PDA-0 h catalyst (85.6 kJ/mol) compared to that of Pd/PDA-24 h (226.9 kJ/mol). Additionally, the initial Heck reaction rate of Pd/PDA-0 h catalyst was approximately 6.4 times higher than that of Pd/PDA-24 h catalyst. Moreover, extensive substrate scope (39 examples) studies employing Pd/PDA-0 h catalyst demonstrated high yields ranging from 61 % to 99 %, with remarkable stability observed even after nine cycles of reuse while maintaining a yield of 91 %. Conversely, sharp decreases in reaction yields were observed upon second reuse with Pd/PDA-24 h, highlighting the superior stability exhibited by our developed Pd/PDA-0 h catalyst and underscoring its potential for large-scale applications in Heck reactions.

AB It is of great importance to remove organic pollutants and obtain nontoxic water. Herein, the hollowed nanorods array with plenty of TiN/TiO2 heterostructures embedded is in-situ generated by seed-assistant growth and nitridation transformation, which is utilized as an electrocatalyst. The array possesses large electrocatalytic active area with intimate interface interaction to facilitate electron transfer. While the electrocatalytic activity can be boosted by the abundant TiN/TiO2 heterogeneous interfaces and oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the TiN/ TiO2-2 exhibits an excellent electrochemical metronidazole removal efficiency of 97.97% and pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.086 min-1 within 80 min. Moreover, TiN/TiO2-2 reveals great stability (10 cycles), environmental tolerance and suitability, and long accelerated experimental lifetime (127 h). The potential electrodegradation pathways of metronidazole are predicted and the toxicity of the possible intermediates is evaluated. Furthermore, TiN/TiO2-2 can be assembled with stainless steel mesh to simultaneously achieve pollutants purification and hydrogen production, demonstrating the feasibility of water treatment and energy conversion.

AB The red-emitting Ca2ZnSi2O7:Pr3+ phosphor was synthesized via a solid-state method and alkali metal ions A(+) (Li+, Na+, K+) were introduced to improve the photoluminescence performance of Pr3+. XRD results confirmed that the sample structure did not change markedly with appropriate Pr3+/A(+) co-doping. Under the blue light excitation of 447 nm, the as-prepared Ca2ZnSi2O7:Pr(3+)efficiently emitted a characteristic red luminescence peak at 601 nm. The luminescence intensity of Pr3+ was obviously enhanced with A(+) co-doping due to the charge compensation effect and the emission intensity of Ca2ZnSi2O7:0.005Pr(3+), 0.005Na(+) reached 142.1% compared to Ca2ZnSi2O7:0.005Pr(3+). Furthermore, at 210 degrees C the luminescence intensity of the Ca2ZnSi2O7:0.005Pr(3+), 0.005Na(+) phosphor remained at similar to 93% compared to at 30 degrees C, showing high thermal stability. The w-LED device packaged with Ca2ZnSi2O7:0.005Pr(3+), 0.005Na(+) produced a bright white emission. All these results indicated the potential application prospects of red-emitting Ca2ZnSi2O7:Pr3+, A(+) phosphors in the field of white light-emitting diodes.

AB Climate warming and extreme climatic events are threatening ecosystem processes and functions. However, it remains unclear how climate warming changes ecosystem stability in facing extreme rainfall events.Here, we investigated the temporal stability of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) in an alpine meadow via a 5-year warming experiment, during which two flooding events occurred, in an alpine meadow.We first found that warming significantly increased the temporal stability of ANPP in facing flooding events by increasing resistance to and decreasing recovery from flooding events. Second, we found that warming shifted the plant community structure by increasing the dominance of grasses and reducing species richness and asynchrony. Last, we detected the higher temporal stability of ANPP under warming, which was mainly ascribed to the warming-induced increase in dominant species stability (Deschampsia caespitosa).Synthesis. These findings indicate that climate warming may mitigate the shock of flooding events on the temporal stability of community productivity via altering plant community structure in alpine grasslands. Our study highlights that to buffer ecosystems from climatic extremes, we should focus on promoting the maintenance or selection of dominant species rather than only focusing on increasing species richness.

AB With their seemingly limitless capacity for self-improvement, stem cells have a wide range of potential uses in the medical field. Stem-cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs), as paracrine components of stem cells, are natural nanoscale particles that transport a variety of biological molecules and facilitate cell-to-cell communication which have been also widely used for targeted drug delivery. These nanocarriers exhibit inherent advantages, such as strong cell or tissue targeting and low immunogenicity, which synthetic nanocarriers lack. However, despite the tremendous therapeutic potential of stem cells and EVs, their further clinical application is still limited by low yield and a lack of standardized isolation and purification protocols. In recent years, inspired by the concept of biomimetics, a new approach to biomimetic nanocarriers for drug delivery has been developed through combining nanotechnology and bioengineering. This article reviews the application of biomimetic nanocarriers derived from stem cells and their EVs in targeted drug delivery and discusses their advantages and challenges in order to stimulate future research.

AB BackgroundInterspecific hybridization plays vital roles in enriching animal diversity, while male hybrid sterility (MHS) of the offspring commonly suffered from spermatogenic arrest constitutes the postzygotic reproductive isolation. Cattle-yak, the hybrid offspring of cattle (Bos taurus) and yak (Bos grunniens) can serve as an ideal MHS animal model. Although meiotic arrest was found to contribute to MHS of cattle-yak, yet the cellular characteristics and developmental potentials of male germline cell in pubertal cattle-yak remain to be systematically investigated.ResultsSingle-cell RNA-seq analysis of germline and niche cell types in pubertal testis of cattle-yak and yak indicated that dynamic gene expression of developmental germ cells was terminated at late primary spermatocyte (meiotic arrest) and abnormal components of niche cell in pubertal cattle-yak. Further in vitro proliferation and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of specific type of cells revealed that undifferentiated spermatogonia of cattle-yak exhibited defects in viability and proliferation/differentiation potentials.ConclusionComparative scRNA-seq and in vitro proliferation analysis of testicular cells indicated that not only meiotic arrest contributed to MHS of cattle-yak. Spermatogenic arrest of cattle-yak may originate from the differentiation stage of undifferentiated spermatogonia and niche cells of cattle-yak may provide an adverse microenvironment for spermatogenesis.

AB With the increased concerns on the toxicity of lead, the barium titanate (BT) has developed a vital lead-free ferroelectric material to replace lead-based one due to the extraordinary multi-functionality. However, to date the deep understanding on evolution mechanisms of multiple electro-related performances in single BT based ceramics is still limited, and the simultaneous enhancement or balanced development of com-prehensive performance in BT ceramics face challenges. Here, a new lead-free ceramic system of Ba0.9+xSr0.1-xTi0.91Sn0.09O3 (BSTS, 0 <= x <= 0.1) was successfully prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction method, and the dopant tuned multi-functionality and underlying physical mechanism of performance evolutions were revealed in detail. The BSTS ceramics present R-O-T-C multiphase coexistence at a wider temperature range near room temperature, along with the structural features with flattened thermodynamic energy landscape and flexible polarization rotation. Accordingly, the enhanced piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 600 pC/N), large electrostrictive coefficient (Q33 = 0.0405 m4/C2, E = 30 kV/cm), superior electrocaloric effect (AT = 0.77 K, E = 30 kV/cm) with a wider temperature span of 49 degrees C (AT > 0.5 K), and strong electrocaloric strength (AT/AE = 0.3857 K mm/kV, E = 5 kV/cm) are simultaneously attained under smaller electric field for BSTS ceramics. It exhibits a superior comprehensive performance than many reported BT based ceramics, which is suitable for more potential applications in the emerging fields of advanced functional devices, such as high precision displacement or strain actuators and zero-global-warming-potential refrigeration with larger capacity near room temperature. This work sheds insight into simultaneously optimizing different electro-related performances, and stimulates future studies on dopant tuned multi-functionality in BT based ceramics.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, many deep learning methods have been successfully used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) using brain imaging. However, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) of AD detects relatively small lesion areas, and it is difficult to distinguish the early lesions. These factors make it difficult to extract the key features in the subtle regions for discrimination in many studies. To address these issues, an attention-based and micro designed EfficientNetB2 (EB2) approach is proposed in this study to classify AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). First, the front portion of the EB2 uses a global attention mechanism (GAM) to improve the classification results by capturing significant features in three dimensions. Next, coordination attention (CA) was added to the EB2 model. The CA can automatically extract channel and location information from the sMRI two-dimensional slice data. The location information is critical for constructing spatial attention maps that help the model to identify the lesion areas accurately, thereby helping the model to extract features that are useful for classification. Finally, the model uses the micro design (MD) method of the ConvNeXt network, which investigates the effect of activation function and batch normalization layer on the model at the microscopic scale. MD can reduce the model complexity while improving classification ability considerably. The accuracy of the proposed method is 93.30%, 92.42% and 92.03% for AD/NC, AD/MCI and MCI/NC dichotomous data, respectively. Finally, the proposed method outperforms the existing convolutional neural networks, such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet.

AB Context Cichorium intybus L. (Asteraceae) formula (CF) has been applied as a folk medicine to treat hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN). However, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Objective To explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of CF on HN. Materials and methods Through network pharmacological methods, the targets of the active component of CF against HN were obtained. Subsequently, Male Wistar rats were divided into control, HN, allopurinol (50 mg/kg), CF high-dose (8.64 g/kg) and CF low-dose (2.16 g/kg) groups. The HN model was induced via intragastric administration of adenine (100 mg/kg) and ethambutol hydrochloride (250 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. After CF treatment, biochemical indicators including UA, UREA and CREA were measured. Then, HE staining, qRT-PCR and gut microbiota analysis were conducted to further explore the mechanism. Results The network pharmacology identified 83 key targets, 6 core genes and 200 signalling pathways involved in the treatment of HN. Compared to the HN group, CF (8.64 g/kg) significantly reduced the levels of UA, UREA and CREA (from 2.4 to 1.57 mu Mol/L, from 15.87 to 11.05 mMol/L and from 64.83 to 54.83 mu Mol/L, respectively), and mitigated renal damage. Furthermore, CF inhibited the expression of IL-6, TP53, TNF and JUN. It also altered the composition of gut microbiota, and ameliorated HN by increasing the relative abundance of some probiotics. Conclusions This work elucidated the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism by which CF protects against HN from the view of the biodiversity of the intestinal flora, thus providing a scientific basis for the usage of CF.

AB To better evaluate the effects of Acremonium cellulase (AC) and previously screened heat-resistant Lactobacillus plantarum 149 (LP149) on lignocellulose degradation, fermentation quality, and microbial community during ensiling in humid and hot areas, this study used a small-scale fermentation system to prepare hybrid elephant grass silage at 30 and 45 degrees C, respectively. Compared to control and commercial inoculant Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), the addition of AC or strain LP149 decreased the contents of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and cellulose and increased the contents of glucose, fructose, and sucrose during fermentation. Furthermore, AC and LP149 treatments altered the microbial communities' structure during ensiling. AC treatment provided more substrate for microbial fermentation, resulting in an increase in bacterial alpha diversity. LP149 treatment increased the Lactobacillus abundance and optimized the bacterial community compositions. In addition, AC and LP149 treatments had higher (P < 0.05) lactic acid and acetic acid contents and lower (P < 0.05) pH, butyric acid, and NH3-N levels compared to the control. These results indicated that AC and strain LP149 are promising silage additives that can promote lignocellulose degradation and improve the fermentation quality of hybrid elephant grass in humid and hot areas.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are emerging materials with fantastic properties and wide applications. The release of metal ions from MOF materials is usually regarded as the origin of soluble MOF toxicity. However, whether the stable MOF particulates would induce environmental hazards is not clear. Herein, we aimed to reveal the particulate toxicity of MOF materials using the insoluble UiO-66 as the representative MOF and Phanerochaete chrysosporium as the model microorganism. UiO-66 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by solvothermal method and their diameter was 68.4 +/- 8.5 nm. UiO-66 NPs were stable in the culture system and the dissolution rate of 500 mg/L group was 0.26% after 14 d incubation. UiO-66 NPs did not affect the fungus growth according to the fresh weight increases and unchanged dry weights. Fungus mycelia kept even at con-centrations up to 500 mg/L. Ultrastructural observation showed that UiO-66 NPs did not enter the fungal cells, but slightly destroyed the cell wall. UiO-66 NPs inhibited the laccase activity and promoted the activity of manganese peroxidase. The overall impact on the decomposition activity of P. chrysosporium was low in dye coloration test and sawdust degradation assay. Meaningful oxidative stress was aroused by UiO-66 NPs, as indicated by the decreases of catalase, glutathione, and total superoxide dismutase, and the increases of H2O2. Our results collectively suggested that the MOF particulates could induce mild mechanical damage to fungi and the toxicity was low comparing to other instable MOF materials.

AB Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infection leads to autophagy, and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PPRV infection results inmorphological changes of the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and activation of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) of the ER stress unfolded protein response (UPR). Knockdown of ATF6 blocked the autophagy process, suggesting ATF6 is necessary for PPRV-mediated autophagy induction. Further study showed that PPRV infection upregulates expression of the ER-anchored adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which is well-known for its pivotal roles in restricting DNA viruses. Knockdown of STING suppressed ATF6 activation and autophagy induction, implying that STING functions upstream of ATF6 to induce autophagy. Moreover, the STING-mediated autophagy response originated from the cellular pattern recognition receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). The absence of MDA5 abolished the upregulation of STING and the activation of autophagy. The deficiency of autophagy-related genes (ATG) repressed the autophagy process and PPRV replication, while it had no effect on MDA5 or STING expression. Overall, our work revealed that MDA5 works upstream of STING to activate ATF6 to induce autophagy.
   IMPORTANCE PPRV infection induces cellular autophagy; however, the intracellular responses and signaling mechanisms that occur upon PPRV infection are obscure, and whether innate immune responses are linked with autophagy to regulate viral replication is largely unknown. Here, we uncovered that the innate immune sensor MDA5 initiated the signaling cascade by upregulating STING, which is best known for its role in anti-DNA virus infection by inducing interferon expression. We first provide evidence that STING regulates PPRV replication by activating the ATF6 pathway of unfolded protein responses (UPRs) to induce autophagy. Our results revealed that in addition to mediating responses to foreign DNA, STING can cross talk with MDA5 to regulate the cellular stress response and autophagy induced by RNA viruses; thus, STING works as an adaptor protein for cellular stress responses and innate immune responses. Modulation of STING represents a promising approach to control both DNA and RNA viruses.

AB As an essential beverage beneficial for Tibetan people, Ya'an Tibetan tea has received scarce attention, particularly from the point of view of the characterization of its metabolome. The aim of the study is to systematically characterize the metabolome of Tibetan tea by means of untargeted H-1-NMR. Moreover, the variations of its metabolome along ageing time are evaluated by taking advantage of univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 45 molecules are unambiguously identified and quantified, comprising amino acids, peptides and analogues, carbohydrates and derivates, organic acids and derivates, nucleosides, nucleotides and catechins. The concentrations of amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates and catechins are mainly determined by ageing time. The present study would serve as a reference guide for further work on the Ya'an Tibetan tea metabolome, therefore contributing to the related industries.

AB Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized and characterized in vivo for their subacute biotoxicity. Animal experiments revealed that SNPs would not induce changes in inflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota, avoiding damage to mice's organs. Moreover, SNPs were rapidly excreted from the body after 6 h without any accumulation, demonstrating their biosafety. Based on these findings, SNPs were used for beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) desensitization by formation of a protein corona. The thermodynamics and time evolution of beta Lg's secondary structure were investigated to address the desensitization mechanism. The results showed-1600 beta Lg molecules onto a single SNP coupled with significant changes in secondary structure formed a stable SNPs-beta Lg corona with binding affinity (Ka) of 8.4 +/- 0.5 x 105 M- 1. Functionally, the decrease of beta-sheet destroyed the conformation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes and inhibited IgE combining capacity, achieving SNPs' desensitization to beta Lg. Additionally, it takes-2 h to complete changes in beta Lg's surface hydrophobicity and immunoglobulin E (IgE) combining capacity after incubation with SNPs, consistent with the time evolution of structure changes, indi-cating protein corona is response for the desensitization.

AB The positive regulatory role of lncFAM200B in differentiation and lipid deposition in yak intramuscular preadipocytes has been demonstrated in our previous study. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to produce complete mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) profiles after adenovirus-mediated lncFAM200B overexpression in yak preadipocytes using high-throughput sequencing. We constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network with lncFAM200B as the core and identified the functions of the selected target miRNA during cell proliferation and differentiation. We obtained 118 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after lncFAM200B overexpression, 76 of which were up-regulated, including Notch signaling members NOTCH3, DTX3L, and HES4, and 42 DEGs were down-regulated, including genes related to the cell cycle (CCNA2, BUB1, CDC20, TOP2A, and KIF20A). Additionally, many ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway members were also significantly up-regulated (BUA7, PML, TRIM21, and TRIM25). MiRNA sequencing showed that 13 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and 12 miRNAs were down-regulated. Among them, 29 targets of 10 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were differentially expressed, including miR-152-FBXO33, miR-6529a-TRIM21, miR-148c-NOTCH3, and the miR-6529b-HES4 axis. We further verified that overexpression and inhibition of miR-6529a can inhibit and promote, respectively, the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes. Taken together, our study not only revealed the regulatory network of lncFAM200B during yak preadipocytes differentiation but also laid a foundation for elucidating the cause for lower intramuscular fat content in yaks at the molecular level.

AB While surfactants created great convenience for the development of society, the abuse use of surfactants also brought about severe challenges, such as contamination to the environment and life, inactivation and degra-dation of nanomaterials due to the blockage of active sites. To this end, a surfactant-free microemulsion (SFME) was utilized here for the first time to prepare nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) material for surfactant removal from wastewater. The results demonstrated that SFME can effectively control the crystal size of ZIF-8 nanoparticles, just like surfactant-based microemulsion (SBME) system, with a uniform particle size distribution from 20 to 40 nm, smaller and more integral than that was obtained by conventional solvothermal method. Nano ZIF-8 material can efficiently remove surfactant from the wastewater by adsorption, especially for anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)). The adsorption of SDBS on nano ZIF-8 well fitted the pseudo-second order kinetic model and Langmuir adsorption model, with the highest adsorption capacity of 548 mg/g at 318 K. Compared with ZIF-8 based on SBME, ZIF-8 based on SFME showed higher adsorption capacity to SDBS, because of larger surface area and pore volume. The data of zeta potential, FT-IR, XPS and SEM-EDS revealed that the adsorption of SDBS on ZIF-8 not only involves the electrostatic attraction but also hydrophobic interaction including 7C -7C and dispersion force interactions. The current study provides a simple, energy-efficient, green and sustainable route of synthesizing nano ZIFs, without worrying about the secondary pollution, and the as-synthesized can be used as a high-efficient adsorbent to remove the pollutant from water.

AB Recent years have seen rapid advances in the study of Fagaceae-associated gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) of the Eastern Palaearctic and the Oriental (EPO) regions, for both the gall inducing Cynipini (commonly termed oak gall wasps though many species gall non-oak Fagaceae) and the predominantly inquiline tribes Synergini and Ceroptresini. This process has propagated some taxonomic errors and involves many taxa whose taxonomic status is uncertain. To provide a stable foundation for further advance, here we review the taxonomic status of the 212 species (133 oak gall wasps and 79 oak cynipid inquilines) that have been described or recorded in these regions. Of this total, we treat 171 as valid species names (103 oak gall wasps and 68 oak cynipid inquilines) in 20 genera; 22 as synonym names, 13 as incertae sedis, three as nomen dubium, and three as species inquirenda. Callirhytis kunugicola Shinji, 1944 is proposed as syn. nov. of C. kunugicola Shinji, 1943, as Shinji described the same species twice. For all valid species names, we provide taxonomic references, synonyms, and geographical distributions. We summarize what is known of host plant associations and gall locations for gall inducers, and host associations for inquilines. We discuss geographic patterns in the known richness of currently valid species for both groups of organisms, and place this in the context of the biogeography of available Fagaceae host plants. We provide a brief historical review of the study of oak gall wasps and their inquilines in the EPO regions.

AB Simple Summary The yak is the largest mammal in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and also supplies necessary sources of food and finance for the Tibetan people. Their body weight is a valuable trait for breeding. In the traditional breeding processes, pedigree data were used to evaluate individual genetic potency ability. However, based on the free range husbandry and random mating in domesticated yaks, the genetic improvement in yaks' body weight is still very slow. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study using whole genome sequencing data to detect the potential functional genes for body weight in yaks. In total three functional genes were identified as being associated with body weight. The results of this study are important for developing and improving body weight in yaks. The yak is the largest meat-producing mammal around the Tibetan Plateau, and it plays an important role in the economic development and maintenance of the ecological environment throughout much of the Asian highlands. Understanding the genetic components of body weight is key for future improvement in yak breeding; therefore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed, and the results were used to mine plant and animal genetic resources. We conducted whole genome sequencing on 406 Maiwa yaks at 10 x coverage. Using a multiple loci mixed linear model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK), we found that a total of 25,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were distributed across chromosomes, and seven markers were identified as significantly (p-values < 3.91 x 10(-7)) associated with the body weight trait,. Several candidate genes, including MFSD4, LRRC37B, and NCAM2, were identified. This research will help us achieve a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship for body weight.

DT Article
ID MEMORY; BEHAVIOR; SYNAPSE; DEVICES; RRAM
AB With forming-free, self-rectifying, and self-compliant properties, memristors can effectively prevent themselves from experiencing leakage currents and overshoot voltages without any additional circuitry. However, the implementation of all these features in a single memristor remains a challenge. Herein, a multifunctional Si3N4-based memristor with a structure of Ag/a-SiNx/p++-Si has been fabricated, and it was demonstrated, for the first time, that the device exhibits novel analog resistance switching behaviors, such as being forming-free, self-rectifying, and self-compliant, presenting well a coexistence of volatile and nonvolatile performance of resistance switching. The multifunctional analog resistance switching could be attributed to the formation of the Si-dangling bond channel and the migration of Ag+ ions inside the a-SiNx layer. Our current results might provide an insightful understanding of the resistance switching mechanism of Si3N4-based memristors, and the device with a large on/off ratio (>103) and robust retention (>103 s) and endurance (>103 cycles) shows potential for application in crossbar synaptic array devices.

TI Mannose Receptor-Mediated Carbon Nanotubes as an Antigen Delivery System

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are carbon allotropes consisting of one, two, or more concentric rolled graphene layers. These can intrinsically regulate immunity by activating the innate immune system. Mannose receptors (MR), a subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, are abundantly expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. These play a crucial role in identifying pathogens, presenting antigens, and maintaining internal environmental stability. Utilizing the specific recognition between mannose and antigen-presenting cells (APC) surface mannose receptors, the antigen-carrying capacity of mannose-modified CNTs can be improved. Accordingly, here, we synthesized the mannose-modified carbon nanotubes (M-MWCNT) and evaluated them as an antigen delivery system through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, M-MWCNT carrying large amounts of OVA were rapidly phagocytized by macrophages and promoted macrophage proliferation to facilitate cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6) secretion. In vivo, in mice, M-MWCNT induced the maturation of dendritic cells and increased the levels of antigen-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b), and cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6). Taken together, M-MWCNT could induce both humoral and cellular immune responses and thereby can be utilized as an efficient antigen-targeted delivery system.

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been hindered by the difficulty of achieving satisfactory cycling stability of high sulfur loading owing to the structural instability and exaggerated shuttle problem. Here, we design and fabricate a "reinforced concrete" structure based on the carbon fibers (CFs) supporting graphene/carbon nanotubes (GC) matrix composites, followed by a slurry-casting process to produce the final CFs-S/GC cathode with 4.5- 5.5 mg cm-2 sulfur loading. The 3D architecture of the micro/nano-hybrid materials enhances the structural strength and builds an interconnected conductive network for efficient electrolyte infiltration and the rapid electric/ionic transport. Furthermore, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are growth on the surface of CFs by chemical vapor deposition to formation of CFs@CNFs. The CFs@CNFs-S/GC cathode enables the effective confines of polysulfides on electrochemically active sites, leading to a much-improved cycling performance. The strategy reported in this paper provides a feasible way for the construction of CFs or modified CFs skeleton in nanostructured carbon materials for high energy density Li-S batteries.

AB How cooperative behavior evolves is the primary research topic in evolutionary game theory. In recent years, a growing number of researchers have been investigating mechanisms that enhance cooperation behavior. In the present paper, we propose a disconnection-reconnection-elite mechanism for prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift game, and stag-hunt game models on spatial lattice networks. The core of the mechanism lies in: player i decides whether to keep or delete its neighbors from the set of interactive neighbors by comparing its payoff with those of its neighbors; and if there is no more neighbor in player i's interactive neighbor set, the neighbor with the highest payoff in player i's potential neighbor set is chosen and added to the interactive neighbor set. The proposed mechanism can significantly promote cooperation in the three games mentioned above. In addition, increasing population stochasticity significantly promotes cooperative evolution in prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Analysis of active components in Cordyceps sinensis (C. sinensis) is emerging as a research hotspot in traditional Chinese medicine. Here, the visualization of spatial differentiation of ergosterol and other active components in whole C. sinensis was first realized by developing a feasible and simple "segmentation-imaging-splicing" strategy based on time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). A C. sinensis was divided into four parts for TOF-SIMS ion imaging due to its irregular shape and centimeter-scale longitudinal length. Whole-body chemical mapping of C. sinensis was then accomplished by splicing these ion images with normalized size and signal in-tensity. Specifically, ergosterol was found more enriched in host caterpillar, especially enriched in the top of host caterpillar, than in fruiting body. Moreover, ergosterol and lipids showed obviously complementary distribution pattern in some special structures of C. sinensis. This panoramic scanning strategy could provide abundant in-formation about the macroscopic and microscopic spatial differentiation of active components in whole C. sinensis, facilitating the realization of multi-component analysis. The results are expected to give further insight into the growth process of C. sinensis in a new vision and promote the development of extraction tech-nologies for active ingredients in C. sinensis.

AB The gas-phase environment of in vitro culture system plays an important role in the development of oocytes, and oxygen concentration is one of the important factors. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of different oxygen concentrations (20%, 10%, 5% or 1% O-2) in yak oocyte maturation and to detect the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cell apoptosis in yak COCs. First, the maturation rate of oocytes, cleavage rate and blastocysts rate following parthenogenetic activation in the group with 5% oxygen concentration were significantly higher (p < .05) than the other groups. Then, TUNEL analysis showed that the 5% oxygen concentration group significantly inhibited apoptosis of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) compared to the other group, and the transcription and protein levels of pro-apoptotic factor Bax, HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in yak COCs significantly reduced, while anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 significantly increased. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining results indicated that HIF-1 alpha protein was mainly located in theca follicle interna, mural follicular stratum granulosum, corona radiata and ovarian stroma in the follicular ovarian tissue, while VEGF protein was mainly located in the granulosa and theca cell layers. In summary, our findings demonstrate that 5% oxygen concentration may promote maturation and inhibit apoptosis of oocytes through HIF-1 alpha-mediated VEGF expression.

AB Toxoplasma gondii infects almost all warm-blooded animals, including humans. DNA vaccines are an effective strategy against T. gondii infection, but these vaccines have often been poorly immunogenic due to the poor distribution of plasmids or degradation by lysosomes. It is necessary to evaluate the antigen delivery system for optimal vaccination strategy. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been shown to modulate and enhance the cellular humoral immune response. Here, we studied the immunological properties of calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaPNs) as nanoadjuvants to enhance the protective effect of T. gondii dense granule protein (GRA7). BALB/c mice were injected three times and then challenged with T. gondii RH strain tachyzoites. Mice vaccinated with GRA7-pEGFP-C2+nano-adjuvant (CaPNs) showed a strong cellular immune response, as monitored by elevated levels of anti-T. gondii-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), a higher IgG2a-to-IgG1 ratio, elevated interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production, and low IL-4 levels. We found that a significantly higher level of splenocyte proliferation was induced by GRA7-pEGFP-C2+nano-adjuvant (CaPNs) immunization, and a significantly prolonged survival time and decreased parasite burden were observed in vaccine-immunized mice. These data indicated that CaPN-based immunization with T. gondii GRA7 is a promising approach to improve vaccination.

AB An ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) array chip as the irradiation source for nano-TiO2 catalyzed photochemical vapor generation (PCVG) was combined with a hollow electrode point discharge microplasma optical emission spectrometer (HEPD-OES) to realize instrumental miniaturization, and utilized for quantitative analysis of trace selenium (Se). Under the irradiation of the UV-LED array chip, Se(iv) and Se(vi) could be effectively converted into volatile species in a miniature quartz coil coating with nano-TiO2 on its inner wall as a photocatalyst. Meanwhile, volatile analyte species were totally guided into the hollow electrode and transported into the inside of micro-discharge plasma for excitation and enhanced sensitivity. Experimental conditions of PCVG and HEPD-OES were investigated in detail using an analytical line of Se at 203.98 nm through the peak area integrated for quantitation. Under optimized experimental conditions of 0.6 mL sample volume, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 370 nm and 50 W LED, and 75 s UV irradiation, Se(iv) and Se(vi) could be detected with the same LODs, 3.9 mu g L-1 and 4.1 mu g L-1, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by the analysis of the Certified Reference Materials (CRMs, GBW(E)080395 and BWB2427-2016) and real water samples. With the advantages of high compatibility, high efficiency, small size and low power consumption, the integration of UV-LED array chip based PCVG and HEPD-OES would be beneficial to fabricate miniaturized and portable devices for field analysis.

AB As the largest energy storage reservoir, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) stores excess lipids by adipocytes enlargement and/or recruitment of new precursor cells. Energy overload can cause ectopic fat deposition and metabolic diseases. In this study, 6814 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in goat subcutaneous preadipocytes and mature adipocytes by RNA-seq technique. The relative expression of the DEGs were verified by qPCR, such as PLIN2, MECR, ADCY7, PEBP1 and KLF5, and their expression level was found to be consistent with the trend of RNA-seq analysis. The KLF5 was selected for further functional verification. Overexpression of KLF5 promoted both the adipogenesis and the differentiation of preadipocytes, while the expression of preadipocyte marker gene: preadipocyte factor 1(Pref1) was decreased, as well as, peroxisome proliferator activation Receptor gamma(PPAR gamma), CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta(C/EBP beta) and Sterol regulatory element binding protein isoform 1(SREBP1) were increased. On the contrary, the interference of KLF5 could reduce adipogenesis, enhance the expression of Pref1, and reduce the expression of C/EBP beta and SREBP1. Our research provides a basic reference for revealing the mechanism of subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation in goats.

AB Yaks display unique properties of the lung and heart, enabling their adaptation to high-altitude environments, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. In the present study, the proteome differences in lung and heart tissues were compared between yak (Bos grunniens) and three cattle strains (Bos taurus, Holstein, Sanjiang and Tibetan cattle) using the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra/data-independent acquisition (SWATH/DIA) proteomic method. In total, 51,755 peptides and 7215 proteins were identified. In the lung tissue, there were 162, 310 and 118 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) in Tibetan, Holstein and Sanjiang cattle compared to yak respectively. In the heart tissue, there were 71, 57 and 78 DAPs in Tibetan, Holstein and Sanjiang cattle compared to yak respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the DAPs were enriched for the retinol metabolism and toll-like receptor categories in lung tissue. The changes in these two pathways may regulate hypoxia-induced factor and immune function in yaks. Moreover, DAPs in heart tissues were enriched for cardiac muscle contraction, Huntington's disease, chemical carcinogenesis and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450. Further exploration indicated that yaks may alter cardiac function through regulation of type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and Ca2+-release channels. The present results are useful to further develop an understanding of the mechanisms underlying adaptation of animals to high-altitude conditions.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effects of different feeding modes on the growth performance, gut microbiota, and immunity of Black Fattening Goat (Capra hircus). A total of 30 goats were grouped in three groups by their feeding modes (pasture grazing group, PG; barn feeding group, BF; barn feeding + probiotics, BF + P; n = 10) and the study was performed for 114 days. After a 2-week adaptation period, the first growth performance test was conducted, and the blood and fecal samplings (day 0) were collected on January 17, 2020, while the second and third test and samplings were conducted on days 53 and 100 of feeding. The species-composition of fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene-sequencing using PacBio single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing technology. Both the BF and BF + P groups had the highest (P < 0.05) body's weight and length, and chest circumference at days 53 and 100, especially at day 100, the body's weight of both the BF groups were more than 18 kg. The levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were found to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the PG and BF + P groups at day 100. The PG group exhibited the highest number of operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and alpha diversity. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were the predominant phyla in all the fecal samples. The relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were found to be significantly higher (P < 0.05) in PG group and BF + P group at day 100, respectively, which might partially explain the significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of IgA and IgG in these two groups. These findings suggested that BF supplemented with 5 g probiotics (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mannan oligosaccharides) per day has the potential to enhance the growth and immunity of Black Fattening Goats.</p>

AB Mylabris is the dried body of the Chinese blister beetle (Mylabris sp.), which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and achieved significant positive effects in the treatment of cancer including liver cancer, lung cancer, and rectal cancer. However, heavy metal pollution and accumulation of Mylabris insects could pose threat to human health. This study was carried out to assess levels of different heavy metals like Cu, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb, along with soil-plant-insect system and health risks using two representative Mylabris insects from the Hasi Mountains of Gansu Province, China. The results showed that the heavy metal concentration of plants and insects followed the order Cu > Pb > As > Hg > Cd. Compared with soil and plants, the content of Cu in insects was the highest, reaching 45.65 mg/kg. Cu was the main element that caused insects to absorb and accumulate. The quantitative risk analysis implied the two Mylabris insects had carcinogenic risks, with the contribution of As providing 63% and 60.7%, respectively. This kind of carcinogenic risk that the human body could bear was not easy to cause side effects to normal people, but it was difficult and dangerous for cancer patients. Thus, the evaluation of health risk lays the foundation for pollutant risk monitoring.

AB Iridium (Ir) could potentially improve ethanol electro-oxidation to CO2, employing CO species (COad) to be the key C1 intermediates. Thus, it is essential to carry out the investigation on CO adsorption and oxidation on the Ir surface. With regard to CO adsorption, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) shows that only linearly adsorbed COad species (COL) are detected at ca. 2010-2060 cm(-1). With a continuous dosing of CO, the open-circuit potential (OCP) of the Ir electrode decreases to ca. 600 mV, being associated with the displacement and/or consumption of surface OHad species. For CO oxidation, the onset oxidation potential is at ca. 0.64 and 0.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. Meanwhile, the Stark tuning rates of ca. 29 +/- 1 cm(-1) V-1 (acidic media) and 34 +/- 1 cm(-1) V--(1) (alkaline media) suggest an approximate COL monolayer (especially in acidic media), and a stable COL-H2Ofree co-structure could be formed. Therefore, CO oxidation might start from the edges and/or defect sites of the COL-H-2 O-free co-structure, following the "nucleation and growth" kinetic model of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This work may provide new insights into understanding CO adsorption and oxidation on the Ir electrode surface.

TI Enhanced Performance of Palladium Catalyst Confined Within Carbon
   Nanotubes for Heck Reaction
SO CATALYSIS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Heck reaction; Pd nanoparticles; Carbon nanotubes
AB Confined carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are typically used to tune the activity and stability of catalysts so as to increase their efficiency. Herein, we compared the catalytic performances of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) located in different regions of CNTs for Heck reaction. The catalyst with Pd NPs located in the internal surface of CNTs (Pd-in-CNT) has a higher reaction rate than that with Pd NPs attached on the external surface of CNTs (Pd-out-CNT). The activity of the Pd-in-CNT is 9.4 times higher than that of Pd-out-CNT in the Heck reaction, possibly because of the smaller particle size and modified redox properties of the confined Pd NPs. The CNT cavities create more active sites, consistenting with a higher microcalorimetric adsorption of carbon monoxide. Leaching of the Pd species during the reactions was observed with both types of catalysts. However, the Pd-in-CNT catalyst showed lower leaching than that of Pd-out-CNT owing to the spatial restriction of the channels in the former. More importantly, these novel catalysts were also used to synthesize a broad range of p-substituted iodobenzene derivatives, affording new and efficient route for the synthesis of valuable fine chemicals via carbon-carbon bond cross-coupling reactions.

AB Given the complexity of the poverty problem, efforts and policies aiming at reducing poverty should be tailored to local conditions, including cultural, economic, social, and geographic aspects. Taking the Sichuan Province of China as the study area, this paper explores the impact of physical geographic factors on poverty using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models at the county level. In total, 28 factors classified in seven groups were considered as variables, including terrain (relief degree of the land surface, altitude, and slope); vegetation (forest coverage rate); water (drainage network density); climate (temperature, annual average rainfall); and natural disaster (landslide, debris flow, and torrential flood). The 28 variables were then tested using correlations and regressions. A total of six physical variables remained significant for the OLS and GWR models. The results showed that the local GWR model was superior to the OLS regression model and, hence, more suitable for explaining the associations between the poverty rate and physical geographic features in Sichuan.

   Insights into the synergies and antagonisms between Cu and Ag

AB By carefully balancing synergies and antagonisms that arise from incorporating Cu and Ag within a single ZnO-based catalytic platform, the photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnO based on three-dimensional modified ceramic structures can be further significantly enhanced. The performance of Ag/ZnO heterostructure (Z0) was significantly improved by only 0.2 mol% Cu incorporation (Z0.2) and the first-order degradation kinetics constants (K) of Z0.2 were 2 and 1.5 times higher than that of Z0 under simulated sunlight and UV light. The synergies between Cu dopants and metallic Ag were mainly the significantly enhanced visible light absorption capacity and the prolonged photo-excited charge lifetime. However, with the excessive introduction of Cu precursors, the surface Cu2+ was found to inhibit the interfacial charge transfer between Ag and ZnO NPs under UV and visible light irradiation, but the transformation from Cu2+ to Cu+ was also presumed to be a driving factor for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. These interactions may provide a useful pathway for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency of low-cost ZnO-based catalytic platforms.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, various generative models can synthesize fake face images with photo-realistic effects. Glow, a generative flow using invertible 1x1 convolution, is a state-of-the-art technique for efficient synthesis of face images with high resolution and fidelity. However, facial forgeries bring serious challenges to morality, ethics and public confidence. Especially, facial forgeries might change the semantic content conveyed by a face image. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model, namely SCnet, is proposed to expose the Glow-based facial forgery. Specifically, an image sharpening operator is embedded in the convolutional layer as the pre-processing layer of the network to highlight the traces left by Glow. Then, SCnet is specifically designed to automatically learn high-level forensics features from pre-processing results. Moreover, a fake face dataset is built by exploiting the CelebA face image dataset and the Glow-based forgery technique. A series of experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a classification accuracy up to 95.92% under various post-processing operations.

AB The first example of gold-catalyzed formal intermolecular [4 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition was developed using 1,3-dien-8-yne as C4 and C2 units and diazo ester as the C1 unit, which provides expedient access to a series of structurally complicated [5.3.0] bicyclic adducts in moderate yields with moderate to high diastereoselectivities. The key route involved a cascade process of dienyne cycloisomerization, cyclopropyl gold carbene's trapping, and subsequent divinyl cyclopropane (DVCP) Cope rearrangement.

AB Previous studies on tourism land use primarily focus on the spatial distribution, and its related impacts on the environment. Here, we propose a future tourism land use simulation model for mountain vacations based on the cellular automata and Markov chain methods, having verified and simulated tourism land use in Emeishan city at a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m using remote sensing and GIS. In addition, we introduced a tourism land use intensity index to study the spatial expansion mode of tourism land use. The results have confirmed the validity of the model and demonstrated its ability to simulate future tourism land use. The average growth rate of tourism land use from 2010 to 2015 is 33.36%, and tourism land use will rise from 1.26% of Emeishan city's land area in 2015 to 2.95% in 2030. Tourism land use shows a spatial expansion pattern along channels from scenic spots to the urban area. The growth of tourism land use in the protected area has an increasing trend when there is no restriction on development, especially in the Eshan region. The simulation results can provide useful implications and guides for regional tourism planning and management.

AB Selenium-containing surfactants have recently attracted considerable interest, but the influences of a selenium (Se) atom and its site on the solution properties are still a challenge. Herein, we systematically studied the micellization behavior and foam/emulsion properties of ionic liquid surfactants (CmSeCnMPB, m = 14,12,10, m + n = 16, MPB N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide) bearing a Se atom at different sites of the hydrophobic tail, and compared with N-cetyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide (C16MPB). The results showed that the micellization behavior and foam/emulsion properties of CmSeCnMPB arc closely related to the site of the Se atom in the hydrophobic tail. With increasing the spacer between Se atom and headgroup, the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and minimum area per surfactant molecule at the air-water interface (A(min)) all increased, whether for the reduced or oxidized form, and the pC(20) values, standard Gibbs free energy of micelle formation (Delta G(m)(0)) decreased accompanied by an increasing contribution of the Se atom, reflecting a shortening in the effective length of the hydrophobic chain. Upon increasing temperature, the micellization of CmSeCnMPB was transformed from entropy-driven mode to enthalpy-driven mode, and the transformation temperature decreased with increasing the spacer length. The longer the spacer, the worse the foam/emulsion performance, and the greater the oxidation-induced changes in cmc, A(min), pC(20), and foam/emulsion properties. Oxidation can completely switch off the foam/emulsion properties of C10SeC6MPB, but only impair those of C12SeC4MPB or C14SeC2MPB. By comparison with C16MPB, it is confirmed that the Se atom brings two competing effects: enhancing hydrophobicity akin to one methylene and decreasing hydrophobicity by disturbing the regularity. The former prevails over the latter for C14SeC2MPB, but the latter surpasses the former for C10SeC6MPB. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon nanomaterial-supported Pd nanoparticles (Pd/CNS) are easily prepared and effective heterogeneous catalysts for the Heck reaction. However, the drawbacks of poor stability and lower activities compared to homogeneous catalysts limit their use in industrial applications. Chemical modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by heteroatom doping, has been shown to be an effective way to improve the activities and stabilities of Pd/CNT catalysts. Herein we aimed to understand the role of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in improving the activity and stability of supported Pd catalysts based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The adsorption energies of Pd-n (n = 1-6) clusters were investigated for three different types of NCNTs containing graphitic-N (NNTS), pyridinic-N (NNTY), and pyrrolic-N (NNTL). The activities of Pd/NNTS, Pd/NNTY, and Pd/NNTL as catalysts for the Heck reaction were also studied. The calculations regarding the stability and energies of the various interactions revealed that N-doping the CNT structure had important influences on NCNT activity and stability. It was found that NNTL was the most suitable for loading of Pd to catalyze the Heck reaction. Our results showed that the geometry and electronic structures of the heteroatom-doped CNTs were vital for the stability and activities of the catalysts. This work shows that regulation of the distribution of N-structures in N-doped CNTs could effectively enhance the stability and activities of these catalysts.

AB We describe a convenient method for the synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3-diynes from cross-coupling reactions of organoaluminum with alkynylhalides: The cross-coupling reaction of organoaluminum (0.75 mmol) with alkynylhalides (0.5 mmol) mediated by Ni(acac)(2) (5 mol %)/DPPE(10 mol%) at room temperature in DME may produce symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3-diynes in moderate to good yields(up to 98%) derivatives. Their structures have been determined by HRMS and H-1(C-13)NMR data. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The association between mitochondrial DNA haplotype and productive performances has been widely reported in chicken breeds. However, there has not been physiological evidence of this seen previously. In this study, chicken transmitochondrial cells were generated using the nucleus of the DF-1 cell line and mitochondria of primary cell lines derived from two native chicken breeds, Tibetan chicken and Shouguang chicken. Generally, Tibetan chicken primary cells showed a stronger metabolic capacity than Shouguang chicken primary cells. However, the Tibetan chicken cybrids had a dramatic drop in relative mtDNA copies and oxygen consumption. Higher rates of oxygen consumption (OCR) and expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion genes were observed in Shouguang chicken cybrids, potentially reflecting that the mitochondrial DNA haplotype of Shouguang chicken had better coordination with the DF-1 nucleus than others. Meanwhile, mitonuclear incompatibility occurred in Tibetan chicken cybrids. The results demonstrate functional differences among mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and may shed light on the interaction between the mitochondria and nucleus in Gallus gallus domesticus.

AB Dunaliella has been extensively studied due to its intriguing adaptation to high salinity. Its di-domain glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) isoform is likely to underlie the rapid production of the osmoprotectant glycerol. Here, we report the structure of the chimeric Dunaliella salina GPDH (DsGPDH) protein featuring a phosphoserine phosphatase-like domain fused to the canonical glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase domain. Biochemical assays confirm that DsGPDH can convert dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) directly to glycerol, whereas a separate phosphatase protein is required for this conversion process in most organisms. The structure of DsGPDH in complex with its substrate DHAP and co-factor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) allows the identification of the residues that form the active sites. Furthermore, the structure reveals an intriguing homotetramer form that likely contributes to the rapid biosynthesis of glycerol.

AB Recently, theranostic candidates that provide a combination of gene delivery and image diagnosis have attracted much interest in medical research. However, there are still many challenges for their clinical applications, such as uncontrollable gene delivery, high cytotoxicity, low transfection efficiency and reduced image contrast. Herein, redox-responsive polyethyleneimine-coated magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs@rPEI) were prepared for both efficient gene delivery and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Firstly, crosslinked rPEI was synthesized by Michael addition reaction with N,N-bis(acryloyl)cystamine, dopamine and low-molecular-weight branched PEI. The rPEI was then coated onto IONs by ligand exchange reaction forming IONs@rPEI. The physicochemical properties of the IONs@rPEI, such as chemical structure, size, zeta potential and DNA condensation ability, were investigated. In addition, a rapid degradation of the as-prepared nanoparticles was observed, which was triggered by reducing glutathione via destruction of disulfide linkages suggesting a potential controllable DNA release in tumor cells. In MR imaging detection, the IONs@rPEI had a high T-2 relaxivity of 81 L mmol(-1) s(-1) indicating a potential usage as MR imaging contrast reagent. In cell assay, the IONs@rPEI exhibited low cytotoxicity and good transfection efficiency. In conclusion, the as-prepared crosslinked IONs@rPEI can be used as a promising technology platform for gene therapy and MR imaging in theranostics. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Three new 11-hydroxyburnamine (1) and rauvoyunnanines A-B (2-3), and fourteen known (4-17) monoterpenoid indole alkaloids were isolated from the total alkaloids extract of Rauvolfia yunnanensis, which exhibited promising immunosuppressive activity on T cell proliferation in preliminary screening. Their structures were determined by analysis of high-resolution electrospray ionization mass (HRESIMS), ultraviolet (UV) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data, and by comparison with the literature. All the alkaloids were evaluated for inhibitory activity on T cell proliferation. Among them, one new compound (1) and reserpine (6) exhibited moderate immunosuppressive activity, with IC50 values of 5.9 mu M and 5.0 mu M, respectively.

AB Rainfall events have been reported of great influence on concentration and flux of aquatic organic carbon, but little is known in ditch water of peatlands. In this work we chose a ditch located in a peatland of Zoige Basin in northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and studied the response of organic carbon (in dissolved form (DOC) and in particulate form (POC)) to rainfall events with varying intensity. Organic carbon dynamics during four rainfall events were recorded in the growing season of 2016. During events, evident but different trends in both POC and DOC were observed. POC steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations following the discharge peaks and followed by steep decrease, while dilution effect on DOC was observed. Different temporal patterns between POC and DOC indicated that they were transported through different flow paths. The dilution in DOC was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff, rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water, and sampling uncertainties. Rainfall intensity had strong influence on organic carbon. The higher rainfall intensity, the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of POC/DOC concentration. The investigation of the response of organic carbon to rainfall events and the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes.

AB We investigated the microstructure, optical, ferromagnetic, and gas sensing properties of (F, Na)-codoped ZnO nanocrystals at room temperature with variable Na doping concentration. The XRD and XPS patterns showed that the nanocrystals crystallize in the wurtzite structure with F and Na codoping without any secondary phases. The ferromagnetic state of Zn0.95Na0.025F0.025O revealed an almost monotonic increase with increasing oxygen vacancy concentration below 2.5 mol% doping of Na. Meanwhile, the magnetization showed an inverse trend with increased Na ions, indicating that the oxygen vacancy mediated by Na+ exchange antiferromagnetic state is predominant. It is very interesting that the variation trend of magnetic and gas sensing properties of Zn0.95-xNaxF0.025O nanocrystals mostly conforms to that of the photoluminescence in our experiments. The gas sensing results demonstrate that oxygen vacancy has a significant effect for as gas-sensitive materials rather than nanoparticle/crystallite size in this work. And it is meaningful to explore the potential relationship of nanocrystal defects on the optical, magnetic, and gas sensing properties of Zinc oxide-based multifunctional nanomaterials.

AB Aim: We conducted an up-to-datemeta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in different age groups. Methods: The relevant RCTs in cancer patients receiving ICIs were searched and the systematic evaluation was performed. PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies published till January 2019. Results: A total of 27 RCTs included 17,546 patients were available for this meta-analysis. ICIs significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in both of the younger (<65 years) and the older cancer patients (>= 65 years). No significantly prolonged OS and PFS was observed among patients older than 75 years. Conclusion: ICIs could not significantly improve OS and PFS compared with controls in cancer patients aged over 75 years.

AB Hollow Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes were synthesized by stirring in a heated oil bath using P25 as titanium source and lithium hydroxide as lithium source. The as-prepared samples displayed a nanotube structure, with diameter of about 20 similar to 50 nm and length of 0.4 mu m. The specific surface area of as-prepared samples reached 153.2 m(2)g(-1). It is demonstrated that the Li4Ti5O12 nanotubes with improved performance can be obtained by hollow structure and high specific surface area. In consequence, it delivered a high reversible initial discharge capacity of 174.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C rate. A stable capacity of 170.9 mAh g(-1) was delivered when the rate was reduced back to 0.5 C, suggesting good structural stability of the nanocable, high reversibility even after high rate charge-discharge, and good cycle stability. In addition, a capacity of 134.9 mAh g(-1) and 98 mAhg(-1) could be retained at a high rate of 5 C and 10 C, indicating excellent rate performances.

AB In this study, 96 diarrheic and 77 non-diarrheic fecal samples from dairy calves were collected from 14 dairy farms in 4 provinces to investigate the molecular prevalence and genomic characteristics of Bovine Kobuvirus (BKoV) in China. The results showed that the BKoV positive rate for the diarrheic feces (35.42%) was significantly higher than that for the non-diarrheic feces (11.69%, p < 0.001). Interestingly, three potential novel VP1 lineages were identified from 15 complete VP1 sequences, and a unique triple nucleotide insertion which can result in an aa insertion, was first observed in the 11/12 VP0 fragments with 660 bp long in this study, compared with known BKoV VPO sequences. Moreover, the first Chinese BKoV genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named CHZ/CHINA. The open reading frame (ORF) of the genome from strain CHZ/China shares 87.4%-88.3% nucleotide (nt) and 93.7%-96.4% amino acid (aa) identity, compared with the three known genomes of BKoV. Interestingly, phylogenetic tree based on aa sequences of these genomes showed that CHZ/CHINA was clustered into an independent branch, suggesting the strain may represent a novel BKoV strain. The findings contribute to better understanding the molecular characteristics and evolution of BKoV.

AB The development of an accurate and noninvasive preselection process for competent oocytes is essential to achieve a highly efficient in vitro production (IVP) of embryos. Cumulus cells (CCs) have important functions in oocyte growth, development, maturation, and fertilization. It, therefore, is important to know if the quality of oocytes can be ascertained by assessment of gene expression of the surrounding CCs or not. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in yak CCs from oocytes with varying developmental competences as possible biomarkers for distinguishing oocyte competence. The isolated CCs were pooled into immature and mature groups in accordance with the maturation outcome of oocytes. A total of 9516 genes were differentially expressed in the two CC categories (P < 0.05). With a minimum change of 2.5-fold, 45 up-regulated and 79 down-regulated genes were observed in CCs belonging to the mature group compared with those in the immature group (P < 0.01). These genes were primarily enriched for the cell cycle, meiosis, cell signaling, metabolism, and apoptosis. The selected candidate genes (CCND1, BMP15, GDF9, H19, KLF4, GPC1, SYCP3, and CTSB) were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and there were expression patterns similar to those detected with transcriptome analysis. The CCs from fertilized oocytes arrested at the 2-cell (2-cell group), or 8-cell (8-cell group) stages or that developed into blastocysts (the blastocyst group) had a 1.5-, 1.8-, and 2.3-fold increase, respectively, in mRNA relative abundance of CCND1 compared with CCs from unfertilized oocytes (P < 0.05). The results with the RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the relative abundance of CCND1 mRNA in CCs was associated with oocyte developmental competence. In conclusion, RNA-Seq is useful in extracting transcriptomes and selecting markers associated with oocyte developmental competence. Furthermore, the expression of the CCND1 gene in yak CCs can be used to preselect oocytes for IVP efficiency.

In this study, 211 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 25 farms across six provinces in China, between November 2017 and September 2018. 20.4% of the samples were detected as BNoV-positive by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses based on RdRp, VP1, and VP2 fragments revealed these BNoV strains had unique evolutionary characteristics. The complete genome of strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH was successfully sequenced. It was 7321 nucleotides (nt) in length, shared 79.4-80.9% nt identity with all five BNoV genomes, clustered on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that strain Bo/BET-17/18/CH could represent a novel BNoV strain. Two interesting characteristics were found in the genome: (i) the VP1 sequence differed greatly from known BNoV VP1 sequences; (ii) a recombination event is predicted within the ORF1-ORF2 overlap. Moreover 16.3% (7/43) of the BNoV were identified as the novel VP1 genotype, which were distributed on four farms across two provinces, indicating that the novel VP1 genotype strain has spread. To our knowledge, this is first description of the molecular and genomic characteristics of BNoV in China. These findings extend our understanding of the genetic evolution and epidemics of BNoV.

AB This paper investigates hybrid observer design of a class of unknown input switched nonlinear systems. The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that the stability of all subsystems of the error switched systems is not necessarily required. First, an output derivative-based method and time-varying coordinate transformation are considered to eliminate the unknown input. Then in order to maintain a satisfactory estimation performance, an impulsive full-order and switched reduced-order observer are developed with a pair of upper and lower dwell time bounds and constructing time-varying Lyapunov functions combined with convex combination technique. In addition, the time-varying Lyapunov functions method is also used to analyze the stability of a class of error switched nonlinear systems with stable subsystems. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We performed an meta-analysis to fully investigate the diarrhea of EGFR-TKIs in cancer patients. The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published till August 2017. The relevant RCTs in cancer patients treated with EGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. Twenty-four RCTs and 13,748 patients were included. The current analysis suggested that the use of EGFR-TKIs increased the risk of all-grade diarrhea (RR 3.45; 95%CI, 2.94-4.06; p < 0.00001) and high-grade (>= grade 3) diarrhea (RR 8.22; 95%CI, 6.02-11.23; p < 0.00001). On subgroup analysis, the risk of all-grade and high-grade diarrhea varied significantly within drug type. The risk of all-grade diarrhea varied significantly according to cancer type, whereas the risk of high-grade diarrhea did not. The risk of all-grade and high-grade diarrhea did not varied significantly based on treatment line, treatment duration and median age. The available data suggested that the use of EGFR-TKIs is associated with a significantly increased risk of diarrhea in cancer patients.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a cytotoxic mycotoxin that can cause cell damages. The main effect is to inhibit protein synthesis. Oxidative stress is one of the effects of DON. Selenium (Se) can ameliorate the cell damage caused by DON-induced oxidative stress, but it is unclear whether through selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). We established GPX1-knockdown porcine spleen lymphocytes, and treated them with DON and Se. Untransfected porcine splenic lymphocytes (group P) and transfected cells (group M, GPX1 knockdown) were treated with or without DON (0.824, 0.412, 0.206, or 0.103 mu g/mL, group D1-4), Se (Na2SeO3, 2 mu M, group Se), or both (group SD1-4) for 6, 12, or 24 h. The cells were collected and the activities of SOD and CAT, levels of GSH, H2O2, malonaldehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and the inhibition of free hydroxyl radicals were determined. Levels of ROS were measured at 24 h. Compared with group P, the antioxidant capacity of group M was reduced. DON caused greater oxidative damage to the GPX1-knockdown porcine splenic lymphocytes than to the normal control cells. When Na2SeO3 was combined with DON, it reduced the damage in the GPX1-knockdown porcine splenic lymphocytes, but less effectively than in the normal porcine splenic lymphocytes.

AB Voltammetric dealloying is employed here to investigate the correlations between catalytic performance and surface composition and structure, taking ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) on Pd-Cu alloy surface as a case study. First, home-made PdCu/C with a mean particle size of ca. 3.110.6nm is dealloyed by repetitive potential cycling in 0.5M H2SO4. With dealloying cycles rising, the Cu component is gradually leached out and the corresponding Pd/Cu atomic ratio gradually increases from ca. 2.1 to 4.0; meanwhile, SEM images display that Pd-rich porous shell is formed due to dealloying-induced surface structural rearrangement, being verified by the appearance of ear-like peaks at -0.015V (vs. SCE) in CVs collected in 0.5M H2SO4; furthermore, XPS spectra indicate that core-level binding energies of Pd 3d(5/2) first positively shift to 336.1eV and then oppositively move down to 334.9eV, indicating that the d-band center of Pd composition is modulated by the dealloying treatment. Moreover, the voltammetric peak current densities for EOR follow the order of PdCu/C-DA15>as-prepared PdCu/C ?>PdCu/C-DA30?commercial Pd/C?PdCu/C-DA75, due to the modest downshift of Pd d-band center resulted by charge transfer and surface atomic rearrangement. In addition, the EOR durability gradually decays with the continuous loss of Cu, indicating that electro-oxidation of surface species also follows the so-called bi-functional mechanism. This work might provide some new insights into the catalysis enhancement by tuning the surface/interfacial structure of catalysts.

AB This article explains the gentrification process in Chengdu, China, during the 2000s from a sociocultural perspective. It examines the spatial pattern of and correlations within gentrification in the inner city of Chengdu and embeds the gentrification process within the context of post-socialist societal transition in major Chinese cities. The research reveals that while state-led urban strategies provided the initial impetus of gentrification in Chengdu, the consumer revolution has awakened personal consumption as a force sustaining its development. Gentrifiers in Chengdu were constituted by a cohort of high-income consumers of varying socioeconomic backgrounds but collectively motivated by a new urbanism privileging the accumulation of social and cultural capital. Moreover, political-economic elites have led the creation of this new urbanism and oriented the sociocultural change of inner-city gentrifiers. Consequently, this article argues that a consumer class, replacing a socioeconomic class, has nurtured class-related urban change and, consequently, social conflict in certain inner-city areas. State and society interactions, rather than state or society domination, have determined the characteristics of gentrification in Chengdu.

AB Severe restrictions for chromium discharge and scarcity of chromium resources have forced the tanners to seek for low-waste and high exhaust chrome tanning technology. Based on the structural traits of dendrimers, in this paper, a series of hydroxyl terminated dendrimers (HTD) with different molecules weight (Mw) was synthesized and applied in the chrome tanning of pigskin. The effect of HTD was investigated on chromium discharge in effluent, and on the shrinkage temperature (Ts), denaturation temperature (Td), mechanical properties, and microstructure of the leather. The experimental results indicated that the chromium discharge in effluent by applying HTD (A1) was reduced to 236.0 mg/L, almost one-sixth of the conventional chrome tanning. HTD that, possesses high hydroxyl density, has endowed the obtained leather with higher chrome uptake, Ts, and mechanical properties. Specially, HTD could slow down the basification process by the forming of hydrogen bonds with collagen residues. In addition, HTD could combine more chromium and form net crosslink, notably improve the chrome uptake and hydrothermal stability. Therefore, it is conceivable that the HTD could act as a high exhaustion agent in chrome tanning process.

AB (1-x)(K0.48Na0.52)NbO3-xBi(0.5)Li(0.5)ZrO(3) (KNN-xBLZ, 0 <= x <= 0.05) lead-free ceramics were prepared by the conventional solid-state technique. The evolution of their phase structure and electrical properties was systematically investigated as a function of the amount of BLZ. An orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase was found in the composition range of 0.02 <= x <= 0.05, and obtained an enhanced electrical property (e.g., d(33) similar to 265 pC/ N, k(p) similar to 36.5%, T-C similar to 364 degrees C, epsilon(r) similar to 1210, tan delta similar to 0.032, and P-r similar to 27.5 mu C/cm(2)) in the ceramics with x = 0.03. Notably, a good temperature-stable dielectric [epsilon(r(300 degrees C)) / epsilon(r(20 degrees C)) approximate to 1.07%] was observed in a broad temperature range from 20 degrees C to 300 degrees C at x = 0.03, which was benefited from the contributions of TO-T closing to the room temperature and high T-C to avoid the sudden change in dielectric properties at the temperature range of 20-300 degrees C, indicating that such a material may have great potential for high temperature applications.

AB Previously we synthesized redox sensitive polyurethane micelles, core crosslinked by diisocyanates (PUCCL). To improve the intracellular drug release and tumor cellular toxicity of anticancer drugs loaded into polyurethane micelles, we now describe redox sensitive polyurethane micelles with tunable surface charge switchabilities, crosslinked with pH cleavable Schiff bonds, as anticancer drug carriers. Different amounts of 1,6-diaminohexane were connected onto the pendant carboxyl groups of amphiphilic multi-blocked polyurethane (PU-SS-COOH), resulting in polyurethanes with various ratios of pendant carboxyl and amine groups (denoted as PU-SS-COOH-NH2-1, PU-SS-COOH-NH2-2 and PU-SS-COOH-NH2-3). The surface charge switched as the pH was increased for PU-SS-COOH-NH2-1, PU-SS-COOH-NH2-2 and PU-SS-COOH-NH2-3. Then the PU-SS-COOH-NH2-3 micelles, dissolved in water, were crosslinked by glutaraldehyde resulting in surface charge switchable and reduction responsive polyurethane micelles with acid cleavable crosslinks (PU-ACCL). The crosslinked polyurethane micelles (PU-ACCL) demonstrated superior particle stability in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) solution without reducing agents, whereas the drug release rate was markedly accelerated by the addition of glutathione (GSH). Notably, the drug release from PU-ACCL was further accelerated in acidic fluid as the result of acid induced cleavage of the crosslinks. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded PU-ACCL micelles displayed increased cytotoxicity against tumor cells which was comparable to that obtained for DOX loaded into uncrosslinked polyurethane micelles. The reduction responsive and surface charge switchable polyurethane micelles with acid cleavable crosslinks, which have superior extracellular stability and provide rapid intracellular drug release, may hold great potential as a bio-triggered drug delivery system for cancer therapy.

AB The aggregation and fracture of oxide-coated metal nanoparticles have a significant influence on their physical and chemical behaviors in synthesis, combustion, or detonation. How does the dynamic loading caused by the impact between nanoparticles affect them? Motivated by this issue, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations of two colliding aluminum nanoparticles to investigate their mechanical and thermal properties and response at impact velocities of 200 m/s, 600 m/s, 1000 m/s, and 2000 m/s. At the relatively low impact velocities (equal to or less than 1000 m/s), it was observed that the particles are mildly deformed and adhere to each other, but the shells do not undergo fracture under the dynamic loading. The metal core and oxide shell behave elastically at 200 m/s and elasto-plastically at 600 m/s. A concentration of dynamic volumetric stress appears but no concentration of shear stress and no formation of a hot spot. Due to the low intensity of the loading and the efficient propagation of the stress wave, the shells fail to fracture. At an impact velocity of 2000 m/s, the impact region of the shell undergoes ductile fracture, and the two particles undergo sintering and form a new particle re-coated with oxide, resulting from the concentration of dynamic shear stress and the formation of a hot spot. At all impact velocities in our simulations, the impact between the nanoparticles improves the aggregation but has a little effect on the fracture of the oxide shell. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Compared with organic-counterpart or micro-counterpart, nanothermites have attracted substantial interests owing to their exhibited outstanding properties. A common goal of a great amount of studies in nanothermite-based energetic materials is to enhance the reaction properties. Thermite planar geometry structural systems have been the promising structures because they are very tunable to control the alternating layered geometry and thickness of fuel and oxidizer. In this article, the planar interfacial contact Al/Fe2O3 nanolaminate thermite systems were studied to explore the effects of variations in preheating temperature, preheating rate and the initial distance between participating fuel and oxidizer on reaction properties and products characterizations by using the classic molecular dynamics simulations. According to the results, ignition delay and reaction time decrease with increasing the preheating temperature. The ignition delay and reaction time decrease from hundreds of picoseconds to a few tens of picoseconds. Additionally, higher heating rate results in higher energized structure, and much more energy was absorbed during heating period leading to a much shorter ignition delay. Reaction will start when the initial distance among reactants is shorter than a certain distance after passing through the ignition delay. Analyses also show the majority number of triangular structure for Fe2Al clusters and a small amount of tetrahedral structure for Fe3Al clusters during thermite reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hawthorn (CFS) has commonly been applied as an important traditional Chinese medicine and food for thousands of years. The raw material of CFS is commonly processed by stir-frying to obtain yellow (CFY), dark brown (CFD), and carbon dark (CFC) colored products, which are used for different clinical uses. In this study, an intelligent sensory system (ISS) was used to obtain the color, gas, and flavor samples data, which were further employed to develop a novel and accurate method for the identification of CFS and its processed products using principal component analysis. Moreover, this research developed a model of an artificial neural network, which could be used to predict the total organic acid, total flavonoids, citric acid, hyperin, and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural via determination of the color, odor, and taste of a sample. In conclusion, the ISS and the artificial neural network are useful tools for rapid, accurate, and effective discrimination of CFS and its processed products.

AB To investigate the effects of green tea waste on growth and health of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), Green tea waste (GTW) and green tea (GT) were added in the basal diet (BD) of fish by replacing wheat at an inclusion level of 5% to form three diets. 60 grass carp (43.8 +/- 2.8 g) were divided into three groups (each group having two replicates) and fed for 66 days. After which growth and health of fish were determined. The results showed that final weight of fish and feed efficiency ratio in GTW group were between BD and GT groups and they were not different compared with BD or with GT groups. Expression of muscle myf5 and myf6 in GTW were between BD and GT group, being significantly lower than BD group. Serum TP, ALB, GLO, HDL, LDL and T-AOC in GTW group were significantly higher than BD group. Expression of hsp 70 and ubiquitin in hepatopancreas of fish in GTW group were significantly higher than BD group. The results suggest that GTW supplementation has positive impact on health of fish without affecting the growth of fish.

AB Recent studies showed that Guaiazulene (GA) and Sodium guaiazulene sulfonate (GAS-Na) have good anti-gastric ulcer effect. Here, two series of GA derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-gastric ulcer activity. The data obtained from in vivo testing of these compounds in a rodent ethanol-induced stomach injury model are discussed. Among the tested compounds, A1, A4, and A9 (ulcer index: 1.125 +/- 1.246**, 1.714 +/- 0.756*, 1.875 +/- 1.126*) exhibited better anti-gastric ulcer activity than the positive control Omeprazole (2.005 +/- 1.011*). The information got from these studies and the results of 3D-SAR investigation may be useful in the design of novel anti-gastric ulcer agents.

The substitution was applied in the cores, the shells, and/or the whole clusters. All these clusters are characterized by their core-shell structures in which the core-shell interaction was found different from those in core or in shell, as reflected by their bondlengths, volumes, and binding energies. Moreover, the core and shell combine together to compose a new cluster with electronic and optical properties different from those of separated individuals, as reflected by their HOMO-LUMO gaps and optical absorptions. With the substitution of Cd by Zn, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of clusters change regularly. The binding energy increases with Zn content, attributed to the strong Zn-Se bonding. For the same core/shell, the structure with a CdSe shell/core has a narrower gap than that with a ZnSe shell/core. The optical absorption spectra also change accordingly with Zn substitution. The peaks blueshift with increasing Zn concentration, accompanying with shape variations in case large number of Cd atoms are substituted. Our calculations reveal the core-shell interaction and its influence on the electronic and optical properties of the core-shell clusters, suggesting a composition-structure-property relationship for the design of core-shell CdSe and ZnSe nanoclusters.

AB The density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the geometries, relative stabilities, electronic properties and natural population analysis for small neutral, anionic, and cationic indium clusters. From 2D to 3D structures of the neutral, anionic, and cationic indium clusters are studied. The optimized results indicate that the geometries of the anionic and cationic indium clusters exhibit large similarities from those of neutral indium. According to the calculations of the averaged binding energy, fragmentation energy, and second-order energy difference, we estimate the relative stabilities of In-n((0,+/- 1)) clusters. Odd-even alterations are found in the adiabatic electron affinity (AEA), vertical electron detachment energy (VDE), adiabatic ionization potential energy (AIP), and vertical ionization potential energy (VIP) for the neutral, anionic, and cationic indium clusters. In-14 has the highest AEA, In-10 has the highest VDE, In-13 has the highest AIP, and In-5 has the highest VIP. The HOMO-LUMO gaps are also calculated for the In-n((0,+/- 1)) clusters to investigate their electronic properties. Natural population analysis reveals that the sign of the charge are zero for In-n clusters, In-n(-) clusters occupy the negative charges and In-n(+) clusters occupy the positive charges.

AB Solar desalination technology has gained prominence as an effective approach to address the scarcity of clean water. Graphene oxide-based (GO) membrane has broad application prospects in desalination due to its excellent photothermal properties. However, traditional GO membrane evaporators suffer from relatively low evaporation efficiency and poor long-term stability. Herein, GO membranes cross-linked by zinc ions and tannic acid (GO-ZnTAa) are prepared by static deposition strategy to boost photothermal properties and stability. Based on two cross-linkers, the formation of a metal phenolic network (MPN) enhances multiple reflections of sunlight among GO nanosheets, which greatly enhances the absorption capacity of GO-Zn-TAa membranes. After the introduction of MPN into GO-Zn-TAa membranes, the lamellar distance of membranes is effectively expanded, which facilitates the transport of water molecules. Under synergistic optimization of light absorption performance and water transport path, the evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency of GO-Zn-TA80 membrane under one solar intensity reach up to 1.74 kg m-2 h- 1 and 92.11 %. Moreover, the GO-Zn-TA80 evaporator reveals an efficient photothermal desalting effect on simulated seawater, which can satisfy the drinking water regulations set by the WHO. Furthermore, GO-Zn-TAa membranes have admirable stability when exposed to strong acid, alkali solution, and high-concentration saline water, a long-term stability over 60 days can be achieved with a stable evaporation rate of 1.40 kg m-2 h- 1. This environmentally friendly, low-cost evaporator is easily scalable and presents favorable application potential in solar desalination.

AB Anthropogenic activities have significantly increased soil nutrient availability, thereby influencing ecosystem processes and functions, particularly in nutrient-limited ecosystems like alpine grasslands. Despite substantial efforts dedicated to comprehending the responses of plant productivity and community composition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition, our understanding of the effects of nutrient additions on soil organic carbon (SOC) remains limited. Here, we implemented a 12-year manipulative fertilization study with three levels (0, 10 and 30 g m(-2)) of N, P, and NP fertilization (N and P fertilization at a ratio of 1:1) in an alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Results showed that N and P additions increased the content of soil organic carbon compared with control. Under the same fertilization conditions, soil organic carbon content increased with the increases of fertilization level, and reached the maximum under N30 treatment (P < 0.05). N and P additions promote the labile carbon (polysaccharide-C and alcohol-C) consumption and the stable carbon (aromatic C and aliphatic-C) enrichment, consequently, it improved the stability of soil organic carbon and facilitated the sequestration of soil organic carbon in alpine meadow. The highest stability of soil organic carbon presented in NP30 treatment compared with others treatments. Indicating that NP addition simultaneously can promote the stability of SOC more. The structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that under the N and P additions treatments, the main factors affecting soil organic carbon stability were soil organic carbon, pH, ratio of carbon and phosphorus (C:P), ratio of carbon and nitrogen (C:N), soil available N:P (AN: AP), available phosphorus (AP), soil available C:N (AC:AN), soil water content (SWC), total nitrogen (TN), available (AN). Overall, nitrogen and phosphorus additions altered soil physicochemical properties as well as the composition of functional groups within soil organic carbon in alpine grasslands, ultimately promoting its accumulation while also impacting both the content and stability of soil organic carbon.

AB With rapid urbanization, the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection have become increasingly complex and exhibit multiscale characteristics. Constructing a green space ecological network (EN) is an effective approach to alleviate urban ecological issues and maintain regional ecological security. However, traditional EN research often focuses on a single scale, neglecting multiscale nesting and collaborative optimization of landscape elements, particularly the importance of spatial granularity. To address this deficiency, this study proposed a multiobjective, multiscale nested green space EN framework for Chengdu, China. Using landscape pattern index fitting functions, morphological spatial pattern analysis, the connectivity index, circuit theory, hydrological analysis model, scale nesting, and hierarchical transmission theories, a multiscale coupled synergistic and hierarchical optimization regional green space ecological security pattern (ESP) was developed. Analysis of the derived results revealed the following. (1) With increasing granularity, the landscape pattern indices showed overall increasing, overall decreasing, and overall fluctuating trends. The optimal granularity threshold for large, medium, and small scales was 9, 6, and 3 m, respectively. (2) Overall, 92, 66, and 88 ecological sources; 403, 278, and 321 ecological corridors; 72, 77, and 47 pinch points; 96, 94, and 88 barriers; and 182, 120, and 87 ecological nodes were identified in the city, central city, and old city areas, respectively. (3) The ENs demonstrated reasonable hierarchical nesting characteristics, essential for interscale material and energy circulation. There were 9 overlapping ecological sources with total area of 18.34 km(2) and 47 overlapping corridors with total length of 53.37 km. These overlapping areas were key regions for ensuring stability in the overall regional ESP and continuity in biological processes, and should be given priority protection. In addition, there were also 19 overlapping pinch points, 12 overlapping barriers, and 4 ecological nodes that accounted for 26.39 %, 24.68 %, and 40.43 % of the total pinch points; 12.50 %, 12.77 %, and 13.64 % of the total barriers; and 2.20 %, 3.33 %, and 4.60 % of the total ecological nodes in the city area, central city area, and old city area, respectively. The high overlap of ecological strategic points across scales indicated cross-scale continuity of biological processes. (4) Enhancing the habitat quality of land types such as forest land, green spaces, grassland, and water bodies is crucial for restoration of ecological corridors and strategic points. Constructing a multiscale hierarchical linkage framework and formulating cross-scale pattern optimization and coordination schemes can effectively address ecological issues. The multiscale nested and synergistic green space ESP, constructed from the "source-corridor-strategic-point-network" framework, enhances the connectivity of regional landscape elements, increases energy flow efficiency, and strengthens spatial stability. The results provide methodological support for strategic policymaking focused on ecological spatial governance of an urban ecological protection at multiple levels.

AB With the comprehensive implementation of China's "dual carbon" goals, the building heating sector, characterized by high energy consumption and emissions, urgently requires low-carbon transformation. However, energy-saving measures for plateau regions are scarce and face challenges due to harsh climates. This study proposes an innovative heating method utilizing composite phase change materials. A new modular phase change thermal storage electric heating terminal integrated with a photovoltaic thermal system has been designed to address issues of high building energy consumption and problems related to heating system freezing and leakage in the Tibetan Plateau (Qinghai-Xizang Plateau). Laboratory tests were conducted on six groups of samples with different structures and placements to examine their heat storage and release characteristics. Results indicate: The system's temperature stabilization time totals 14.6 h; Horizontally placing the terminal reduces melting time by up to 2.7 h, enhancing heat storage performance; Structure three shortens solidification time by up to 2.2 h compared to structure one, improving heat release performance; Vertically placed terminals have better heat release performance than horizontally placed ones, resulting in more effective indoor heating. This study proposes a modular design for phase change heat storage electric heating walls, simplifying installation and maintenance while maintaining aesthetic appeal. Detailed temperature measurements of different wall surfaces revealed excellent cyclic heat storage and release performance. The developed phase change heat storage electric heating terminal is expected to significantly reduce heating energy consumption in the Tibetan Plateau (Qinghai-Xizang Plateau), enhancing building energy efficiency and providing valuable insights for further applications of phase change materials in building design.

AB The prevalence of neurological dieases, including neurodegenerative, neurotraumatic disorders, and neuroinflammatory conditions, has been rising due to global population and aging demographics. A key factor in the pathogenesis of these disorders is the hyperaccumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Nanozymes have emerged as promising candidates for neurotherapeutic applications owing to their exceptional catalytic activity and stability. Of particular note is their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and counteract the production of reactive oxygen species via their enzyme-mimicking characteristics. In this review, the latest advancements and theoretical knowledge in this research domain are summarized. Using the inherent functionalities of the Web of Science and bibliometric methodologies, annual publication trends are identified and extensively explored the most researched topics and neurological disorders in this field. The antioxidant reduction chemistry of the nanozymes is discussed, highlighting their ability to mimic natural oxidoreductase activity and inhibit RONS production at the source. Moreover, this review delves into the current limitations and future prospects of these mechanisms in addressing neurological disorders. The significant benefits and recent developments in the use of RONS-regulating nanozymes for the treatment of neurological diseases are emphasized, offering insights into their therapeutic applications and broader implications for neurology.
   Illustration summarizes the application of nanozymes in treating various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and spinal cord injury. Highlights the role of nanozymes in crossing the blood-brain barrier, mimicking antioxidant enzymes, and regulating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation. image

AB This paper studies the frequency fluctuation problems of a multi-area power system with renewable energy sources (RESs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. (i) Due to the decoupling of the RESs from power system using electronic devices, the RESs have no natural frequency response capability, which result in decreasing of entire power system equivalent inertia with large penetration of RESs. (ii) DoS attacks cause the insecurity of network communication, which can vanish data transmission and yield data packet dropout. To address the above issues, a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) incorporated with load frequency control (LFC) method (VSG-LFC) is proposed by introducing a hybrid-triggered mechanism (HTM) to (i) reduce the system sensitivity to the penetration level of RESs; (ii) compromise between frequency regulation performance and the reasonable usage of network resource under unsecured communication environments. Then, a switched system model is constructed considering non-identical DoS attack situations. Furthermore, theoretical analyses using Lyapunov functional related methods are carry out for asymptotical mean-square stability with H infinity performance on frequency regulation. Simulation evaluations of power system verify the effectiveness of this development. It shows that in a two-area power system frequency derivation performance indicators (IAE, ITAT, ISE) in Area 1 are reduced by (82.996%, 86.273%, 85.823%) and in Area 2 are reduces by (77.996%, 83.613%, 82.315%).

DE MOF/polypeptide nanoparticles; Controlled drug release; Combined

AB The challenge of drug resistance in bacteria caused by the over use of biotics is increasing during the therapy process, which has attracted great attentions of the clinicians and scientists around the world. Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) triggered by photosensitizer (PS) has become a promising treatment method because of its high efficacy, easy operation, and low side effect. Herein, the poly-L-lysine (PLL) modified metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles, ZIF/PLL-CIP/CUR, were synthesized to allow both reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive drug release and photodynamic effect for synergistic therapy against drug resistant bacterial infections. The PLL was modified on the shell of the zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF) by the ROS-responsive thioketal linker for controllable CIP release. CUR were encapsulated in ZIF as the photosensitizer for blue light mediated photodynamic effect to produce singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and superoxide anion radical (O-center dot(2)-) for efficient inhibition towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The charge conversion from negative charge (-4.6 mV) to positive charge (2.6 mV) was observed at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5, and 70.9 % CIP was found released at pH 5.5 in the presence of H2O2, which suggests the good biosafety at physiological pH and ROS-responsive drug release of the as-prepared nanoparticle in the bacterial microenvironment. The as-prepared nanoparticles could effectively kill MRSA and disrupt bacterial biofilm by combination of chemo- and photodynamic therapy. In mice model, the as-prepared nanoparticles exhibited excellent biosafety and synergistic effect with 98.81 % healing rate in treatment of MRSA infection, which is considered as a promising candidate in combating drug resistant bacterial infection.

AB Zogie Wetland is an important ecological protection area in the alpine region of southwest China. Coordinating the relationship between socio-economic (SE) and ecological environment (EE) in this area is instructive for economic development and ecological improvement of ethnic minority regions in Southwest China. Previous studies on the degree of coupled coordination in alpine wetlands are relatively scarce. In this study, six counties under the jurisdiction of the Zogie wetland in China are selected as the research objects, and a new framework for coupled coordination analysis is constructed, and the particle swarm optimization-dynamic deviation maximisation (PSO-DDM) method is used to assess the indicators' performance of the SE and EE subsystems. The coupled coordination degree (CCD) model was then used to assess the temporal and spatial change patterns of coupled coordination between SE and EE in the Zogie Wetland, thus revealing the interaction mechanism between the SE and EE of alpine wetlands. The results of the study show that the overall change in CCD of SE and EE has shown an increasing trend over time, but it has not reached excellent co-ordination at the moment, which may be due to the slow development of the area as a result of its special geographical location and relatively weak ecological resource endowment. In addition, industrial restructuring, increase in vegetation cover and investment in industrial pollution control have a contributing effect on CCD, while industrial emissions and urban sewage discharge have a significant inhibitory effect on CCD. These findings and discoveries can provide valuable insights for urban planning, large-scale engineering construction and tourism industry development in alpine wetlands. It also provides an important reference for achieving sustainable development goals(SDGs) of alpine wetlands.

AB Due to cold winter and abundant solar energy, passive solar houses have significant energy-saving potential and application prospect in Qinghai-Tibet plateau. For passive solar houses, exterior windows can affect lighting energy consumption through natural lighting, which in turn affects the indoor thermal environment. Meanwhile, solar radiation and heat transfer by temperature difference can also influence heating and cooling energy consumption through exterior windows. To explore the effect of exterior windows on the overall energy consumption, it is necessary to conduct specialized research from the perspective of the photothermal coupling effect of exterior windows. Thus, a global energy consumption calculation method (GECM) is proposed in this paper to evaluate the impact of exterior windows on building energy consumption. In GECM, the correlation of daylight factor has been established, and main exterior window design factors affecting the global energy consumption have been investigated, including window to wall ratio (WWR), window orientation and window type on. A residential building is selected as a case study and results show that reasonably selecting window type and designing WWR can effectively reduce the global energy consumption, which provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the optimization design of exterior windows in Qinghai-Tibet plateau region.

AB Class imbalance poses difficulties in training a classifier that perform well on minority classes, especially when there is a high imbalance ratio and significant class overlap. Existing datalevel methods often suffer from problems like information loss and overfitting. To address these problems, we introduce a novel majority affiliation based under -sampling method (MAUS). The MAUS method employs a support vector data description model to capture the distribution of the minority class, thereby forming a hyper -sphere to establish a majority affiliation for each sample. The high -dimensional hyper -sphere constructed through all minority class samples avoids the problem of overfitting. Leveraging the majority affiliation in conjunction with the k -nearest neighbor algorithm, MAUS is capable of identifying region of class overlap and subsequently removing majority samples within these regions that negatively impact classification performance. This selective removal process minimizes excessive information loss at classification boundaries while alleviating the issue of class overlap. Furthermore, by removing those majority samples that are situated far from the classification boundary, MAUS reduces the imbalance ratio to the expected value, resulting in the attainment of a balanced dataset. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments comparing it with state-of-theart methods on 30 publicly available datasets. The results indicate that our approach outperforms existing methods on most of datasets and classifiers.

AB Heating ventilation and air conditioning system accounts for over one third of building energy usage, especially for public buildings due to large indoor heat source and high ventilation and thermal comfort requirement compared to residential buildings. Natural ventilation shows high application potentials in public buildings because of its high-efficient ventilation effect and energy saving potential for indoor heat dissipation. In this paper, the building design is conducted for a science museum and library with atrium -centered natural ventilation consideration. The floor layout, building orientation and internal structure are optimized to make full use of natural ventilation for space cooling under local climatic conditions. A natural ventilation model is established through building field tests to evaluate the air flow and thermal environment under indoor and outdoor pressure differences. The preliminary results show that Building A's courtyard exhibited overheating issues, likely attributed to outdoor solar radiation, whereas Building B's courtyard experienced localized cooling, possibly due to indoor air conditioning system controls. Addressing these concerns necessitates modifications in courtyard design and structure. Moreover, both courtyards displayed vertical temperature gradients, emphasizing the need for effective management of outdoor heat influx and enhancements in indoor ventilation and shading strategies. To mitigate these issues, the study proposed three distinct roof design models and more refined indoor air conditioning system control strategies. The optimization of architectural design can achieve a maximum energy-saving rate of 46.54 %. Furthermore, aligning functional zones with thermal comfort areas was recommended to enhance overall building thermal comfort. The findings and proposed solutions from this study are anticipated to contribute to the enhancement of thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and vertical temperature distribution in large public buildings, catering to user requirements while reducing energy consumption. This research holds significant implications for advancing sustainability and environmental preservation in the realm of architecture.

AB BackgroundThe yak is a symbol of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and provides important basic resources for human life on the plateau. Domestic yaks have been subjected to strong artificial selection and environmental pressures over the long-term. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of phenotypic differences in yak populations can reveal key functional genes involved in the domestication process and improve genetic breeding.Material and methodHere, we re-sequenced 80 yaks (Maiwa, Yushu, and Huanhu populations) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic variants. After filtering and quality control, remaining SNPs were kept to identify the genome-wide regions of selective sweeps associated with domestic traits. The four methods (pi, XPEHH, iHS, and XP-nSL) were used to detect the population genetic separation.ResultsBy comparing the differences in the population stratification, linkage disequilibrium decay rate, and characteristic selective sweep signals, we identified 203 putative selective regions of domestic traits, 45 of which were mapped to 27 known genes. They were clustered into 4 major GO biological process terms. All known genes were associated with seven major domestication traits, such as dwarfism (ANKRD28), milk (HECW1, HECW2, and OSBPL2), meat (SPATA5 and GRHL2), fertility (BTBD11 and ARFIP1), adaptation (NCKAP5, ANTXR1, LAMA5, OSBPL2, AOC2, and RYR2), growth (GRHL2, GRID2, SMARCAL1, and EPHB2), and the immune system (INPP5D and ADCYAP1R1).ConclusionsWe provided there is an obvious genetic different among domestic progress in these three yak populations. Our findings improve the understanding of the major genetic switches and domestic processes among yak populations.

AB Malicious websites present a substantial threat to the security and privacy of individuals using the internet. Traditional approaches for identifying these malicious sites have struggled to keep pace with evolving attack strategies. In recent years, language models have emerged as a potential solution for effectively detecting and categorizing malicious websites. This study introduces a novel Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, based on the Transformer encoder architecture, designed to capture pertinent characteristics of malicious web addresses. Additionally, large-scale language models are employed for training, dataset assessment, and interpretability analysis. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the large language model in accurately classifying malicious websites, achieving an impressive precision rate of 94.42%. This performance surpasses that of existing language models. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis sheds light on the decision-making process of the model, enhancing our understanding of its classification outcomes. In conclusion, the proposed BERT model, built on the Transformer encoder architecture, exhibits robust performance and interpretability in the identification of malicious websites. It holds promise as a solution to bolster the security of network users and mitigate the risks associated with malicious online activities.

AB Feature selection is related to information processing, and its measurement and algorithm use various intelligent methodologies, such as neighborhood rough sets (NRSs). At present by NRSs, the relative neighborhood self-information (Relative-NSI) introduces an information function for algebraic characterization, and its feature selection algorithm (NSI-FS) has been successfully applied. However, Relative-NSI and NSI-FS ignore the underlying recognition information of decision classes; thus, they have the advancement space. In this study, absolute rates and correlative coefficients of decision classes are double-quantitatively introduced, and three-order approximation accuracies are systematically established to induce a robust self information measure; thus, corresponding feature selection optimally improves NSI-FS to have generalization abilities. Firstly, three-order approximation accuracies are constructed by using two-time class weights of absolute rates and Spearman's correlation coefficients, and the new measure called ClaWNSI promotes Relative-NSI in terms of class recognition. Then, the three order approximation accuracies and subsequent ClaWNSI are evolved in matrix forms, and relevant class weights of Spearman's correlation coefficients are realized by two vectors from approximation matrices. Furthermore, ClaWNSI and its feature significance motivate a heuristic selection algorithm (called ClaWNSI-FS). Finally, data experiments on 14 datasets validate ClaWNSI and ClaWNSI-FS; ClaWNSI-FS outperforms NSI-FS and five other contrast algorithms to acquire better classification performance.

AB Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). The emergence of the novel G2b strains of PEDV has increased the need for new vaccines. We generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing the spike (S) protein of G2b PEDV based on human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5), named rAd5-PEDV-S. Immunization with rAd5-PEDV-S elicited a significant PEDV-specific humoral immune response in sows, including IgA and IgG in colostrum and serum and circulating neutralizing antibodies. The efficacy of rAd5-PEDV-S was superior to that of the commercial inactivated vaccine, and the intramuscular (IM) route was more effective than the intranasal route. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in immunization effect between the twice and once-immunized IM groups (administered 5 weeks before farrowing). Five-day-old piglets born to sows immunized with the rAd5-PEDV-S through the IM route had less diarrhea and weight loss when challenged with PEDV. Fecal PEDV RNA expression in the PEDV-challenged rAd5-PEDV-S IM group piglets was considerably lower than that in the other groups; all five piglets from the rAd5-PEDV-S IM group survived the infection period. Histopathological examination of small intestinal sections revealed evident shedding of ileum intestinal mucosal epithelial cells in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group. These findings suggest that vaccinating pregnant sows with rAd5-PEDV-S induces immune responses in the pregnant sows and passively protects piglets. Our findings highlight the potential of rAd5-PEDV-S as a candidate vaccine for PED.IMPORTANCEPorcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly infectious and economically significant gastrointestinal disorder that affects pigs of all ages. Preventing and controlling PED is achieved by immunizing sows with vaccines, enabling passive piglet immunization via colostrum. The prevalence of G2b porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) continues in China despite the use of commercial vaccines, raising questions regarding current vaccine efficacy and the need for novel vaccine development. Adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has several advantages, including high transduction efficiency, a wide range of host cells, and the ability to infect cells at various stages. In this study, we expressed the immunogenic proteins of spike (S) using an Ad5 vector and generated a PED vaccine candidate by inducing significant humoral immunity. The rAd5-PEDV-S prevented PED-induced weight loss, diarrhea, and intestinal damage in piglets. This novel vaccine candidate strain possesses the potential for use in the pig breeding industry.

AB The orientation of slopes in alpine zones creates microclimates, e.g. equatorial-facing slopes (EFSs) are generally drier and warmer than are polar-facing slopes (PFSs). The vegetation growing in these microhabitats responds divergently to climatic warming depending on the slope orientation. We proposed a spatial metric, the greenness asymmetric index (GAI), defined as the ratio between the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on PFSs and EFSs within a given spatial window, to quantify the asymmetry of greenness across aspects. We calculated GAI for each non-overlapping 3 x 3 km(2) (100 x 100 Landsat pixels) grid, and seamlessly mapped it on Tibetan Plateau (TP) grassland using NDVI time series from the Landsat-5, -7 and -8 satellites. PFSs were greener than EFSs (GAI > 1) in warm and dry areas, and EFSs were greener than PFSs (GAI < 1) in cold and wet areas. We also detected a stronger greening trend (0.0040 vs 0.0034 y(-1)) and a higher sensitivity of NDVI to temperature (0.031 vs 0.026 C-degrees(-1)) on PFSs than EFSs, leading to a significant positive trend in GAI (0.00065 y(-1), P < 0.01) in the TP from 1991 to 2020. Our results suggest that global warming exacerbated the greenness asymmetry associated with the slope orientation: PFSs are more sensitive to warming and have been greening at a faster rate than EFSs. The gradient of EFSs and PFSs provided a "natural laboratory" to study interaction of water and temperature limitations on vegetation growth. Our study is the first to detect the effect of aspect on the greening trend in the TP. Future research needs to clarify the full biotic and abiotic determinants for this spatial and temporal asymmetry of greenness across aspects with the support of extensive field measurements and refined high-resolution NDVI products.

AB The reasonable design of atomically dispersed Ni-N-x sites in porous carbon nanostructures is an efficient strategy to enhance the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalytic activity. In this work, atomically dispersed Ni-N-x sites on hierarchically porous carbon catalysts (HP-Ni-NC) were fabricated by a facile NaCl template-assisted pyrolysis method. The catalysts exhibit a large specific surface area and a hierarchical porous structure, facilitating the exposure of numerous active sites and the mass/electron transport during the CO2RR. Consequently, the CO Faradaic efficiency maintained over 90% in a wide potential window on the optimized HP-Ni-NC-2 catalyst. The CO partial current achieved 15.2 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in a H-cell. Furthermore, the current density can achieve 250 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 3.11 V in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, demonstrating great promise for commercial-scale application. This study presents a facile approach to synthesizing hierarchically porous structure single-atom catalysts with superior catalytic performance toward CO2RR.

AB This paper is devoted to reduce the conservativeness of distributionally robust optimization with moments information. Since the optimal solution of distributionally robust optimization is required to be feasible for all uncertain distributions in a given ambiguity distribution set and so the conservativeness of the optimal solution is inevitable. To address this issue, we introduce the globalized distributionally robust counterpart (GDRC) which allows constraint violations controlled by functional distance of the true distribution to the inner distribution set. We obtain the deterministic equivalent forms for several GDRCs under the moment-based framework. To be specific, we show the deterministic equivalent systems of inequalities for GDRCs under second order moment information with a separable convex distance function and a special jointly convex function, respectively. We also obtain the deterministic equivalent inequality for GDRC under first order moment and support information. The computationally tractable examples are presented for these GDRCs. Numerical tests of a portfolio optimization problem are given to show the effectiveness of our method and the results demonstrate that the globalized distributionally robust solution is non-conservative and flexible compared to the distributionally robust solution.

AB Processing of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is a traditional pharmaceutical technology in Chinese medicine. Traditionally, proper processing of CHMs is necessary to meet the specific clinical requirements of different syndromes. Processing with black bean juice is considered one of the most important techniques in traditional Chinese pharmaceutical technology. Despite the long-standing practice of processing Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua (PCH), there is little research on the changes in chemical constituents and bioactivity before and after processing. This study investigated the influence of black bean juice processing on the chemical composition and bioactivity of PCH. The results revealed significant changes in both composition and contents during processing. Saccharide and saponin content significantly increased after processing. Moreover, the processed samples exhibited considerably stronger DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging capacity, as well as FRAP-reducing capacity, compared to the raw samples. The IC50 values for DPPH were 1.0 +/- 0.12 mg/mL and 0.65 +/- 0.10 mg/mL for the raw and processed samples, respectively. For ABTS, the IC50 values were 0.65 +/- 0.07 mg/mL and 0.25 +/- 0.04 mg/mL, respectively. Additionally, the processed sample demonstrated significantly higher inhibitory activity against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase (IC50 = 1.29 +/- 0.12 mg/mL and 0.48 +/- 0.04 mg/mL) compared to the raw sample (IC50 = 5.58 +/- 0.22 mg/mL and 0.80 +/- 0.09 mg/mL). These findings underscore the significance of black bean processing in enhancing the properties of PCH and lay the foundation for its further development as a functional food. The study elucidates the role of black bean processing in PCH and offers valuable insights for its application.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) can be incorporated into hydrogels to obtain multifunctional hybrid systems to meet the delivery needs of different drugs. However, the stability of NPs in hydrogels is rarely revealed. In this article, we tried to explore the underlying mechanism of an interesting phenomenon that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PNPs) could flocculate and deposit in Pluronic F127 (F127) hydrogels at 4 degrees C. The results showed that this flocculation was relevant to the type of emulsifier formulated in PNPs, the particle materials and the F127 concentration, but independent of PLGA polymer end groups. Exactly, PNPs containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the emulsifier flocculated in F127 solution with a concentration above 15 %. The flocculated PNPs possessed increased particle size, decreased zeta potential, reduced hydrophobicity and an obvious coating layer, and these characteristics could be restored almost to the original state after two washes of flocculated PNPs with water. Moreover, the flocculation had no impact on the long-term size stability and drug-loading capacity of PNPs, and F127-treated PNPs showed improved cellular uptake than untreated PNPs. These results provide the evidence that adsorption of high concentrations of F127 on the surface of PNPs/PVA may lead to flocculation, and the flocculation is reversible by simply washing the flocs with water. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to scientifically explore the stability of PNPs in F127 hydrogels, providing theoretical and experimental support for the rational design and further development of nanoparticle-hydrogel composite.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) are regarded as the developing trend of future transportation due to the advantages in terms of increasing traffic throughput, safety, and reducing energy con-sumption. One of the challenging CAV research problems is intelligent collaborative driving decision in dynamically changing traffic scenarios. The sixth-generation mobile communication technology (6G) plays an important role in attaining CAV intelligent driving in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) by provide significantly higher system performance, higher spectral efficiency, higher reliability, and higher security. This paper formulates the collaborative decision problem of CAVs at unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where CAVs entering an intersection safely cross the intersection and minimize their traffic time through collaborating to learn a strategy. An efficient and scalable MARL algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is applied to the dynamic intersection scenarios, where the parameter-sharing mechanism is used to improve the PPO algorithm to be a multi-agent version. Instead of the global reward, the local reward is used to promote cooperation between agents and achieve scalability. In addition, the action masking mechanism is adopted to improve the learning efficiency by filtering out invalid actions at each step. A joint simulation platform is built to verify the performance of the Parameter-Sharing PPO algorithm (PS-PPO). The simulation results show that the PS-PPO algorithm not only guarantees a low collision rate but also greatly reduces the vehicular travel time. This algorithm promotes cooperation among CAVs and performs well in the task of collaborative traffic flow at unsignalized intersections, especially in high-traffic volume scenarios. It is helpful to improve the safety and efficiency of traffic flow at unsignalized intersections.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONSTITUENTS
AB Wuzi Yanzong prescription (WYP), as a classical prescription for male infertility with kidney essence deficiency, is composed of Gouqizi (Fructus Lycii), Tusizi (Semen Cuscutae), Wuweizi (Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis), Fupenzi (Fructus Rubi Chingii) and Cheqianzi (Semen Plantaginis). It has been used for hundreds of years in the treatment of male infertility, known as "the first prescription of ancient and modern seeds", with convincing clinical evidence. At present, more than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from WYP, including polysaccharide, fatty acids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, organic acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, etc. Pharmacological and clinical studies show that WYP has an obvious effect on reproductive system diseases, especially male infertility, which has a very wide application prospect. It also has effects on the nervous system, inhibiting liver injury, lowering blood sugar and blood lipid, anti-aging, improving immunity, resisting hypoxia and fatigue effects. This study reviewed the chemical constituents, quality control, pharmacology, and clinical application of WYP. There is no doubt about the clinical value of WYP, but its quality control system is not perfect, pharmacological mechanism is not fully explained, and clinical applications need to be reevaluated. Therefore, the follow-up researches should proceed from the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and clinical applications, further explain the theoretical connotation, reveal the mechanism of action, and provide the basis for the secondary development of classic famous prescriptions. In addition, WYP is mostly used in combination with western medicines besides being used alone. Whether it can improve the efficacy and reduce side effects will also be a meaningful research direction in the future.(c) 2023 JTCM. All rights reserved.

ID ZINC-FINGER PROTEINS; LIVER METASTASES; GENE-EXPRESSION
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Aberrant regulation of DNA methylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes is one of the fundamental processes driving the initiation and progression of CRC. Zinc-finger proteins (ZNFs) are one of the most abundant groups of proteins and function in many important biological processes related to tumorigenesis. Herein, we detected abnormal hypermethylation of the ZNF334 gene in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues, and this modification downregulated the expression of ZNF334. Furthermore, ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) was identified to be involved in regulating the methylation level of ZNF334. Next, a dCas9-multiGCN4/scFv-TET1CD-sgZNF334-targeted demethylation system was constructed to reverse the expression of ZNF334 through sgRNA targeting the ZNF334 promoter. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the targeted demethylation system upregulated ZNF334 expression and inhibited CRC growth. Collectively, targeted DNA demethylation of the ZNF334 promoter sheds light on the precise treatment of CRC.

AB Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for human and animal health. Understanding the uptake and translocation of Se in crops is critical from the perspective of Se biofortification. In this study, barley was malted to investigate the uptake, translocation, and metabolism of exogenous Se including Na2SeO4, Na2SeO3, and selenomethionine (Se-Met). The results showed that the uptake rates of different forms of Se in barley decreased in the following order: Se-Met > Na2SeO3 > Na2SeO4, with the peak uptake occurring at the end of the steeping stages. In the early stages of germination, Se was mainly distributed in the husk and endosperm. Exogenous Se upregulated the transcription levels of Se transport and metabolic enzyme genes in the barley to varying degrees, which promoted Se transformation in various tissues, and improved Se bioeffectiveness. Compared to the Na2SeO3 and Se-Met groups, more Se was transferred from husk and endosperm to acrospire and rootlets in the Na2SeO4 group during the germination stage. Na2SeO4 and Se-Met stimulated the development of rootlets, and accelerated Se metabolism, resulting in a higher Se loss rate. these new into Se and metabolization in

TI PSS-dispersed dopamine triggered formation of PAA adhesive hydrogel as

DT Article
ID MUSSEL-INSPIRED ADHESIVE; CONDUCTIVE HYDROGEL; ONE-POT; TOUGH
AB Catechol-based hydrogels have good adhesion properties; however, since the concentration of catechol is low and it can be easily oxidized to quinone, the adhesion performance of the hydrogels is reduced, which limits their application as self-adhesive flexible wearable sensors. In this work, a dopamine: poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (DA:PSS)-initiated strategy was proposed to construct adhesive hydrogels, where the semiquinone radicals present in DA:PSS were used to initiate radical polymerization to obtain the DA:PSS/poly(acrylic acid) (DA:PSS/PAA) hydrogel. This hydrogel exhibited good stretchability and adhesion with various substrates. We observed that, even after exposure to air for 21 days under certain relative humidity (76%), the catechol groups hardly oxidized and the DA:PSS/PAA hydrogel presented good adhesion. The DA:PSS/PAA hydrogel also showed good electrical conductivity and fast response ability. Thus, the general strategy of triggering monomer polymerization to form hydrogels based on the semiquinone radical present in DA:PSS offers great potential for their application in flexible electronic devices and wearable sensors.

AB Cloud removal is an important task in remotely sensed images (RSIs) processing, which is beneficial for downstream applications, such as unmixing, fusion, and target detection. Multitemporal RSIs (MRSIs), which contains abundant spatial-spectral-temporal (SST) information, potentially bring new opportunities for cloud removal. However, how to effectively and efficiently explore the rich information of MRSIs remains a challenge. Inspired by the low-rankness of MRSIs, we propose an Unsupervised Domain Factorization Network (UnDFN) for thick cloud removal, which allows us to effectively and efficiently exploit the rich SST information of MRSIs. In the UnDFN framework, we first factorize RSI for each time node of MRSIs into its corresponding spatial factor and spectral factor. Due to powerful expressive ability, untrained neural networks (NNs) are leveraged to faithfully capture the spatial and spectral factors. Especially, motivated by the low-rankness of the concatenated spatial factors of all time nodes, a low-rank spatial factor module is elaborately designed to effectively and efficiently capture the spatial factors of all time nodes as compared with separately using networks to capture spatial factors for each time node. Extensive experiments on simulated and real MRSIs of different satellites (including Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) substantiate that the proposed UnDFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in thick cloud removal compared to other methods.

AB Nanoparticles targeting the DEC-205 receptor were found to induce antigen-specific protective immune response. When the delivery system carries both antigens and immunomodulators, it can maximize the expected thera-peutic effect of the drug and induce effective humoral and cellular immune responses to antigens.In this study, we encapsulated the Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. polysaccharides (EUPS) into PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) and con-jugated it with anti-CD205 monoclonal Ab (MAb) to produce a DEC-205 receptor targeted PLGA nanoparticles (anti-DEC-205-EUPS-PLGA NPs). The physicochemical characteristics and adjuvant activity of the above NPs were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro setting, 200 mu g center dot mL(-1) anti-DEC-205-EUPS-PLGA could improve the proliferation of DCs and promote their antigen up-take activity. In the in vivo setting, anti-DEC-205-EUPS-PLGA NPs remarkably controlled the release of drug and antigen to induce sustained immune responses and up-regulated the levels of FMDV-specific IgG antibodies, promoted the cytotoxic activity of CTLs and NK cells, and improved the proliferation of splenocytes. Moreover, the anti-DEC-205-EUPS-PLGA NPs facilitated the maturation of DCs. The above data indicated that anti-DEC-205-EUPS-PLGA NPs employed as an targeted adjuvant induced the humoral and cellular immune activity by promoting the maturation of DCs. These findings may provide a new insight onto the development of vaccine adjuvants.

AB Sites engineering has been extensively investigated in BaTiO3-based lead-free materials. Although the effect of A or B site substitution on structure and electric properties have been researched adequately, the synergic and competitive impacts of doping element have received little attention, which has become an urgent issue for further optimizing performance. Here, three groups BT-based ceramics [0.6(Ba0.9Ca0.1)TiO3-0.4Ba (Sn0.2Ti0.8)O3, B(Ca)TS, 0.6(Ba0.9Ca0.05Sr0.05)TiO3-0.4Ba(Sn0.2Ti0.8)O3, B(Ca,Sr)TS, and 0.6(Ba0.9Sr0.1)TiO30.4Ba(Sn0.2Ti0.8)O3, B(Sr)TS] are synthesized by normal sintering, revealing the synergic and competitive mechanism of A site doping on structure and properties. The effect of Ca2+ and Sr2+ are quite different on the structure, especially the phase structure and grain size, and the evolution of electric properties (e.g., d33, Strain, and Temperature stability) results from structure caused by the synergic and competitive effect of Ca2+ and Sr2+. For example, a large d33 (similar to 950 pC/N) is obtained in B(Sr)TS due to its closer R-O-T phase structure compared to B(Ca)TS and B(Ca,Sr)TS ceramics, which is superior to some previous BT-based studies. Therefore, exploring of doping mechanism can further tune the microscopic structure and thus enhance electric properties, accelerating the practical process of lead-free ceramics.

TI RANCE: A Randomly Centralized and On-Demand Clustering Protocol for

AB LEACH-like clustering protocols focus mainly on the low-power, low-rate, and low-wakeup network applications, and work in a multiround clustering strategy that causes frequent handovers of cluster heads (CHs), thus less support for real-time services that require stable cluster topologies. Besides, these protocols are faced with respective drawbacks, such as suboptimality of selected heads, costly node-base station (BS) energy overheads, lack of runtime cluster maintenance, etc. This article proposes RANCE, a randomly centralized and on-demand clustering protocol, aiming at prolonging nodes' clustered time to support internodes collaboration while being energy efficient in mobile ad hoc networks. First, RANCE designs a randomly centralized CH selection mechanism in which every node in the local wireless network is eligible to initiate the centralized CH selection, so that the self-organizing characteristics of mobile ad hoc nodes can be utilized for head selection optimization. Second, taking into account the wireless volatility caused by changes of topology, obstacles, signal strength, etc., the fine-grained cluster relationships maintenance is provided by means of multilevel aliveness and adaptive bidirectional heartbeat packets. Third, RANCE works in an event-driven and on-demand manner instead of a time-triggered manner in LEACH-like protocols, to reduce the impact on continuous services caused by frequent CH handovers among all nodes. Simulation results show that RANCE provides longer clustered time (over 99% of nodes' lifetime in networks more than 100 nodes) and good clustering scalability with high consistency at minimum energy cost, and exhibits good potentials in mobile wireless environments that are infrastructureless/poor for continuous missions.

AB Aflatoxin contamination of feed poses a great risk to the global dairy industry. Analyzing the aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1))-induced metabonomic changes in ruminants and screening potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of AFB(1) exposure is urgently needed. Here, the effects of different doses (0, 50, and 500 mu g/kg of the diet, dry matter basis) of AFB(1) exposure on digestibility and performance of Saanen goats were studied, and a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed to reveal plasma metabonomic changes caused by the AFB(1) exposure. In the current study, AFB(1) exposure decreased total-tract nutrient digestibilities, nitrogen retention, total weight gain, and average daily gain of Saanen goats in a dose-dependent manner. Untargeted metabolomics revealed alterations in the plasma metabolome. A total of 3,310 and 1,462 ion peaks were obtained in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Based on the screening criteria, 1,338 differential metabolites were detected between control and low-dose AFB(1) (50 mu g/kg) groups, 1,358 metabolites differed between control and high-dose AFB(1) (500 mu g/kg) groups, and 58 metabolites differed among all groups. Pathway analyses showed that choline metabolism in cancer and glycerophospholipid metabolism were significantly affected by the AFB(1) treatments. Moreover, dysregulation of amino acid metabolism was also observed in AFB(1) treated goats. The findings provided novel insights into the toxicity of AFB(1) in ruminants. Exploring the underlying molecular causes of the changes may help the development of rapid diagnostic techniques and effective interventions for AFB(1) intoxication.

AB Hong Kong is a typical high-density city in a subtropical climate region, and deep street canyons are among the main features of its urban planning. How the urban geometry influences the urban thermal environment in this city has become a hot topic these days. The height-to-width ratio (H/W) and sky view factor (SVF) are commonly used to indicate the outdoor thermal environment performance, while previous studies in Hong Kong rarely analysed the importance bias of these two influencing factors systematically in this context. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we chose four typical sites in Hong Kong as research objects. Firstly, we conducted a field investigation to calculate the main influencing factors of urban street geometry (H/W and SVF) and then used field measurements to collect climatic data, including air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity, and finally used regression to analyse the correlation between H/W, SVF, and temperature. The results indicate the following: (1) There is a greater correlation between H/W and air temperature than between SVF and air temperature by regression analysis, and H/W is more effective at improving the thermal environment within urban street canyons. (2) After field measurements, it was found that H/W at the measurement sites was 0.60 to 6.02, with an average of 2.13. (3) In the study area, H/W of 2.31-2.48 and 3.35-3.60 had a positive correlation with air temperature, and H/W had a dominant influence on outdoor air temperature, and H/W of 2.09-2.31 and H/W > 3.60 was inversely related to air temperature. The conclusions can provide support for urban planning in Hong Kong.

AB Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was used to obtain arabinoxylan (AX) from brewers' spent grain (BSG) with a higher yield, altered structural characteristics, and improved techno-functional properties. Results showed that an UAE procedure working at 400 W for 15 min under a 60% duty cycle could increase the AX yield by 52.41% compared with a traditional alkaline extraction without sonication. Concomitantly, UAE-AX developed a degraded Mw of 2741 kDa, a changed conformation of less molecular asymmetry and a decreased mean particle size from 12.56 to 4.993 mu m. The rheological properties of UAE-AX aqueous solution were improved, leading to higher viscosity and gel-forming capacity of the AX stabilized emulsions. As a result, UAE-AX addition could reduce the mean droplet size to 6.40 mu m and better stabilize the emulsion under various conditions than traditional alkaline extracted AX. Thus, the results proved UAE to be a promising method for extracting AX with increased emulsifying capacity from BSG.

AB Low-cost and simple strategies to synthesize highly efficient and robust oxidative electrocatalysts for commercial large-scale water electrolysis are still a challenge. Here, we reported a reductive H2 plasma surface modification strategy, where a defect-rich amorphous NiFe coating layer can be anchored and interact with porous Co3O4 nanoarrays. The plasma-modified surface can promote the reconstruction process to generate high-valence and ultra-active species, thus forming abundant active centers and oxygen vacancies with high electrocatalytic activity. The H2-NiFe/ Co3O4 composite reveals excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic ability, and ultralow overpotentials of 233 and 273 mV are required to reach 100 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively, for oxygen evolution, while the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) requires the potentials of 1.315 and 1.420 V to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively. The superior electrocatalytic stability is confirmed by a 240 h long-term test at 1 A cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction and the consecutive multistep chronoamperometric tests for the UOR. This work provides an easily scalable and energy-efficient surface modification method to fabricate a robust bifunctional catalyst, while the atomic species and configuration can also be flexibly adjusted, which is suitable to be extended to various application fields.

AB Physicochemical properties, bacterial communities, and volatile compounds of mutton sausage produced from Jianzhou Big-Eared goat meat during natural ripening were investigated. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes accounted for over 66% of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) throughout the whole process, with Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Staphylococcus as the predominant genus during the early and later ripening periods, respectively. The evolution of microbial composition became less rich and diverse. The uncultured bacterium, the Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Staphylococcus were marker bacteria on days 0, 7, and 26, respectively, with none on day 16. The bacteria distribution seemed to influence the volatile profile of mutton sausage throughout processing, with the bacterial composition on day 0 and day 7 clustered separately from day 16 and day 26, and the same pattern for the volatile profile. Meanwhile, the concentration of total volatile fraction significantly increased, and the majority of the volatile compounds were generated during late ripening. Non-anal, hexanal, decanal, heptanal, dodecyl aldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, gamma-dodecalactone, 2-pentylfuran, and 1-octen-3-ol were key volatile compounds, contributing to the overall mutton sausage flavors. Based on Spearman's correlation analysis, Staphylococcus as well as Psychrobacter were positively correlated with the production of the key volatile compounds, and other bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Prevotella_1, Odoribacter, and so on were associated with the production of most alcohols and esters.

AB Vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) belongs to the receptor protein on the membrane of the secretory transport vesicle and involves in host immune function. The intracellular pathogen Spiroplasma eriocheiris could cause Eriocheir sinensis tremor disease. In a previous study, it was found E. sinensis VAMP (EsVAMP) was differently expressed in S. eriocheiris infection by proteomics analysis. This study mainly aims at the function of EsVAMP in the process of the S. eriocheiris infection. The length of EsVAMP gene was 1681 bp, which contained a 395 bp open reading frame, 90 bp 5 degrees-non-coding region (UTR) and 1277 bp 3 degrees-UTR. The results of qPCR showed that EsVAMP was expressed highly in hemocytes and nerves, followed by gills, intestines and hepatopancreas, and lowly expressed in heart and muscles. EsVAMP in hemocytes was up-regulated after S. eriocheiris infection. After EsVAMP over-expression and S. eriocheiris infection, the RAW264.7 cell morphology and cell viability of the experiment group were significantly better than the control group. Meanwhile, the copy number of S. eriocheiris in the experiment group was significantly lower than that in the control group. After EsVAMP and pCMV-Cre-mCherry were ligated and transfected into RAW264.7 cells, it was found that EsVAMP and lysosome co -localized. Meanwhile, the phagocytosed inactivated S. eriocheiris number and phagocytosed efficiency in RAW264.7 cells were increased significantly. The interference experiment was carried out by synthesizing EsVAMP dsRNA to verify that the EsVAMP transcriptions were successfully suppressed. The S. eriocheiris copy number and the mortality of crab increased significantly after EsVAMP RNAi and S. eriocheiris infection. Meanwhile, the phagocytosed inactivated S. eriocheiris number and phagocytosed efficiency in hemocytes decreased significantly after EsVAMP RNAi and S. eriocheiris infection. These results showed that VAMP was involved in the cell phagocytosis to resist pathogen infection.

AB Livestock grazing dramatically impacts the belowground community in grasslands by altering resource input from plants, dung and urine return, and soil environments. However, the belowground response pattern as well as the alterations in soil resource input and environments remain uncertain along a grazing intensity gradient. Here, we examined the response pattern of the soil nematode community (abundance, diversity, structure and functions) to grazing intensity by performing a 5-year field manipulation experiment with four levels of yak grazing intensities in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Moderate grazing (i.e., 2 yak/ha) supported the highest abun-dances of all nematodes, plant feeders and omni-carnivores, and maintained the most closely interspecific in-teractions within the nematode community. Grazing intensity may affect the belowground community via compensatory growth of forages and bottom-up trophic effects from living roots to the soil micro-food web. Furthermore, moderate grazing increased the functional metabolic footprint index of the nematode community, activated the root energy channel, and maintained the balance between the bacterial and fungal channels, which can optimize soil nutrient cycling. The model averaging results showed that the response of the soil nematode community to grazing intensity was mainly related to the alteration of soil moisture, which also showed a hump -shaped response to increasing grazing intensity. These results indicate that the soil nematode community as well as the soil resource input and environments show a hump-shaped response to increasing yak grazing intensity. Our findings have strong implications in optimizing ecosystem structure and functions of grassland on Tibetan Plateau by managing grazing capacity.

TI Glaesserella parasuis induces IL-17 production might through

DE Glaesserella parasuis; IL-17A; Inflammation; Signaling pathways
AB In our previous study, the outer membrane protein P2 of Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) induced the production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in host cells. However, how the G. parasuis infection produces IL-17A in the host is unknown. In this study, at 48 hpi in piglets, the proportion of Th17 cells in the peripheral blood significantly increased as determined by flow cytometry, but the overall proportion was low. IL-17 mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the lungs and spleens of infected piglets. Histopathological examination staining, immunohistochemistry and viability counts, revealed that IL-17 expression might be positively correlated with bacterial content and the degree of pathological injury in lung and spleen tissues. Furthermore, when infected with the G. parasuis Nagasaki strain compared with avirulent strain C5, the primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) significantly produced IL-17 in a time-dose dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that PKC, MEK and NF-kappa B signaling pathways were essential for G. parasuis-induced IL-17 production because the addition of corresponding inhibitors dramatically reduced IL-17 mRNA production. The phosphorylation levels of PKC, ERK1/2 and I kappa B in G. parasuis-infected primary PAMs also increased significantly as the infection dose increased as assessed by western blotting. Thus, these finding imply that IL-17 induced by G. parasuis infection is dependent on activation of PKC-ERK/MAPK and I kappa B/NF-kappa B signaling pathways.

AB Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a well-known causative pathogen for upper respiratory infection in cats. Its high genetic variability challenges existing molecular diagnostic methods in clinical settings. Thus, we developed two sensitive and visual assays for FCV nucleic acid detection based on RPA reaction and CRISPR-Cas13a trans-cleavage activity. Recombinant plasmid DNA, crRNAs, and RPA primers were designed and prepared, respectively, targeting to FCV ORF1 gene. Besides, purified LwCas13a protein was produced by E.coli prokaryotic expression system. To confirm the validity of FCV-Cas13a assays, seven reaction systems (RSs) with different components were tested, and visual readouts were displayed by lateral flow dipstick (FCV-Cas13a-LFD) and fluorescence detector (FCV-Cas13a-FLUOR), respectively. The established FCV-Cas13a assays were capable of detecting FCV nucleic acid in presetting RSs without cross-reaction with other feline-associated pathogens, and the detection limit was as low as 5.5 copies/mu l for both visual methods. Moreover, the positive rate of 56 clinical specimens detected by FCV-Cas13a assays (67.9%, 38/56) was notably higher than that of RT-qPCR (44.6%, 25/56) (p < 0.001), including 13 presumptive positive specimens. Taken together, FCV-Cas13a assays provided reliable and visual diagnostic alternatives for FCV field detection.

AB Adipose tissue not only affects meat quality and animal productivity, but also participates in inflammation and immunity. Ningxiang pig is famous for their excellent meat quality, disease resistance and tolerance of roughage. It is not yet well known how proteins in adipose tissue is dynamically regulated during the growth of Ningxiang pig. This report studies the proteomic changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue in Ningxiang pigs to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of fat development during the growth period. By TMT-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue of 9 purebred Ningxiang pigs of different ages, we identified 2533 unique proteins and 716 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs), of which more than half of the DAPs were concentrated in the 90d-210d period. Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling was only significantly enriched in DAPs of N90d vs N30d, Alcoholism and Graft-versus-host disease were only significantly enriched in DAPs of N210d vs N90d. Proteins related to dilated cardiomyopathy was found to be an important pathway in fat development and lipid metabolism. A variety of novel DAPs involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and cell viability, such as NDUFS6, SDHB, COX5A, ATP5D and TNNT1, which play a role in controlling the prediction networks, may indirectly regulate the development and functional maintenance of adipocytes.
   Significance: These age-dependent DAPs discovered in this study may help expand the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the development, function maintenance and transformation of adipose tissue in Ningxiang pig for developing new strategies for improving meat quality and pig breeding in the future.

AB Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is known to alter soil microbial communities, but how canopy and understory N addition affects soil bacterial and fungal communities in different soil layers remains poorly understood. Conducting a 6-year canopy and understory N addition experiment in a temperate forest, we showed that soil bacterial and fungal communities in the organic layer exhibited different responses to N addition. The main effect of N addition decreased soil bacterial diversity and altered bacterial community composition in the organic layer, but not changed fungal diversity and community composition in all layers. Soil pH was the main factor that regulated the responses of soil bacterial diversity and community composition to N addition, whereas soil fungal diversity and community composition were mainly controlled by soil moisture and nutrient availability. In addition, compared with canopy N addition, the understory N addition had stronger effects on soil bacterial Shannon diversity and community composition but had a weaker effect on soil bacteria richness in the organic soil layer. Our study demonstrates that the bacterial communities in the organic soil layer were more sensitive than the fungal communities to canopy and understory N addition, and the conventional method of understory N addition might have skewed the effects of natural atmospheric N deposition on soil bacterial communities. This further emphasizes the importance of considering canopy processes in future N addition studies and simultaneously evaluating soil bacterial and fungal communities in response to global environmental changes.

The diffusion-derived KCuHCF formation in the nanocomposite hydrogel via layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly can facilitate the preservation of the 3D-interconnected hydrogel structure and the dispersion of KCuHCF particles, which contribute to high-density immobilization of stable KCuHCF (~57.73 wt%) in the matrix. The adsorbent shows enhanced Cs+ removal properties in terms of fast kinetics (> 90% removal for 20 mg/L of Cs+ within 1 h), stability (> 115 mg/g in wide pH value of 2-11), high adsorption capacity (146.22 mg/g) and selectivity (K-d = 1.3 x10(5) mL/g, 1 mg/L Cs+ in highly competitive seawater). Such excellent characteristics with fast kinetics are mainly due to the high ion accessibility from the inherent nature of hydrogels and the highly loaded KCuHCF particles in the composites. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm obey the pseudo-second-order model and the dual-site Langmuir adsorption model, respectively. This nanocomposite hydrogel prepared in our work shows enhanced performance on removal of Cs+ in aqueous solution, which has a good application prospect in treating radioactive wastewater.

AB Based on the multifractal methodology, we examine how complexity in the dynamics of biological systems can be understood. The possible sources of multifractality have been determined by comparing the multifractal indexes obtained on the original, shuffle, Fourier transform surrogate (FTsurrogate), and iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT) time series. This paper shows that the rs-fMRI signal is multifractality. The multifractality is due to the fat-tail probability distribution, long-range dependence (LRD), and the excluded hidden structures. Although the excluded hidden structures also contribute to the sources of the multifractality, it is mainly composed of the fat-tail probability distribution and LRD, especially the fat-tail probability distribution. Specifically, the shuffle, FTsurrogate, and iAAFT series, those three series still display a multifractal behavior. However, based on the shuffle series, we know that the trend of change in the curve of fluctuation functions with q is significantly weakened, indicating that the probability distribution is not the only source of the multifractalionality of the rs-fMRI signal. In addition, the multifractal properties of the shuffle series are not as strong as the original series. The FTsurrogate and iAAFT series also are as powerful multifractals as the original. For the original series, the multifractal spectrum is an asymmetric bell shape, indicating that the multifractal spectrum is on the right. This means that the multifractality of the rs-fMRI signal in this scale range is determined by the multifractal properties of large and small fluctuations. The fat-tailed probability distribution, LRD, and excluded hidden structure are generated by the power-law distributions, scale-free temporal dynamics, and the highly structured dynamical activity in space and time (which means latent variables and connectivity patterns). This study implies that the study on the sources of multifractalionality may also discover new insights into the dynamic mechanism of spontaneous brain activity.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel reactive fluorescent probe 6-(bis(butylthio)methyl)-7-hydroxy-4,8-dimethylcoumarin (L) has been synthesized from 2-methylresorcinol. The structure was characterized by NMR, ESI-MS and elemental analysis. The fluorescence intensity of the probe was very strong in solution, but the fluorescence is quenched after adding Hg2+ to the reaction. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum and fluorescence emission were used to test the probe L in identifying Hg2+. The results show that in the pH range of 4 to 9, the probe exhibited high selectivity, high senstivity and antiinterference, the limit of detection as low as 23.09 x 10(-9) mol/L, which has good application prospects for the rapid dection of mercury ions in real samples.

AB Soil respiration (Rs) is a major component of terrestrial carbon cycling, which varies greatly with spatial heterogeneity or under grazing. There is scant evidence for the interactive effects of microtopography and grazing on Rs, particularly in alpine swamp meadow ecosystems where hummocks and hollows are common micro topographic features. We conducted a grazing exclusion experiment in an alpine swamp meadow on the central Tibetan Plateau. Seasonal variation in Rs and relevant environmental factors were observed between hummocks and hollows in the free grazing plots and grazing exclusion plots. The growing season Rs was significantly higher in the hummocks than that in the hollows. The responses of Rs to grazing varied greatly with microtopographic heterogeneity, with grazing significantly decreasing Rs in the hummocks but greatly increasing Rs in the hollows. The grazing-induced relative changes in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon were positively correlated with the changes in Rs. Grazing and microtopography caused changes in soil temperature and microbial biomass were the major factors that driving the seasonal variation in Rs. This information stresses the importance of hummock-hollow microtopography in regulating carbon cycling in grazed alpine swamp meadows.

TI STCN-Net: A Novel Multi-Feature Stream Fusion Visibility Estimation

ID MODEL
AB Low visibility always leads to serious traffic accidents worldwide, although extensive works are studied to deal with the estimation of visibility in meteorology areas, it is still a tough problem. Deep learning-based visibility estimation methods, it has low accuracy due to lacking "specific features " of the foggy images. Meanwhile, physical model-based visibility estimation methods are only applicable to some specific scenes due to its high requirements for extra auxiliary parameters. Therefore, This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework named STCN-Net for visibility estimation, which combined the "engineered features " and "learned features " to achieve higher accuracy. Specifically, a novel 3D multi-feature stream Matrix, named DDT, is designed for visibility estimation, which is consisted of a transmittance matrix, a dark channel matrix, and a depth matrix. Unlike traditional deep learning methods which only use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to deal with the input data or images, our method combines CNN and Transformer to process the input data or images. In STCN-Net, Swin-Transformer(Swin-T) module takes the original image as input while the CNN module takes the DDT matrix as input. Moreover, in order to integrate different feature information from the CNN and Swin-T, we embed a Coordinate Attention (CA) module in STCN-Net. Finally, two visibility datasets: Visibility Image Dataset I (VID I) and Visibility Image Dataset II (VID II) were constructed for evaluation where VID I is a real scene visibility dataset and VID II is a synthetic visibility dataset. The experimental results show that our method has better performance than classical methods on the two datasets. And compared with the runner-up, it has 2.1% more accuracy in VID I and 0.5% in VID II.

AB Heavy metal wastewater treatment is a huge problem facing human beings, and the application degree of Salix psammophila resources produced by flat stubble is low. Therefore, it is very important to develop high-value products of Salix psammophila resources and apply them in the removal heavy metal from effluent. In this work, we extracted the cellulose from Salix psammophila, and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared through TEMPO oxidation/ultrasound. The aerogel spheres derived from Salix psammophila (ASSP) were prepared with the hanging drop method. The experimental results showed that the Cu(II) adsorption capacity of the ASSP composite (267.64 mg/g) doped with TOCNF was significantly higher than that of pure cellulose aerogel spheres (52.75 mg/g). The presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in ASSP enhanced the adsorption capacity of heavy metals. ASSP is an excellent heavy metal adsorbent, and its maximum adsorption values for Cu(II), Mn(II), and Zn(II) were found to be 272.69, 253.25, and 143.00 mg/g, respectively. The abandoned sand shrub resource of SP was used to adsorb heavy metals from effluent, which provides an important reference value for the development of forestry in this sandy area and will have a great application potential in the fields of the adsorption of heavy metals in soil and antibiotics in water.

AB A series of Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+ and Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+, Gd3+ red-emitting phosphors were prepared via a high-temperature solid-state method, Gd3+ ion was co-doped in Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+ as sensitizer to enhance the luminescence property. The X-ray diffraction results verify that the structure of the as-prepared samples is consistent with the standard Sr9Y(PO4)(7) phase. All the Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+ samples show both characteristic emission peaks at 594 nm and 614 nm under near-ultraviolet excitation of 394 nm. The co-doping of Gd3+ significantly improves the luminescence intensity of the Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+ phosphors due to the crystal field environment effect and energy transfer of Gd3+-> Eu3+ caused by the introduction of Gd3+, especially Sr9Y(PO4)(7):0.11Eu(3+), 0.05Gd(3+), which emission intensity is higher than that of Sr9Y(PO4)(7):0.11Eu(3+) by 1.21 times. The color purity and lifetime of Sr9Y(PO4)(7):0.11Eu(3+), 0.05Gd(3+) phosphor are 88.26% and 3.7615 ms, respectively. A w-LED device was packaged via coating the as-prepared phosphor on n-UV chip of 395 nm with commercial phosphors. These results exhibit that the Sr9Y(PO4)(7):Eu3+, Gd3+ red-emitting phosphor can be used as a red component in the w-LEDs application.

AB Cattleyaks are the crossbred offspring between cattle and yaks, exhibiting the prominent adaptability to the harsh environment as yaks and much higher growth performances than yaks around Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Unfortunately, cattleyak cannot be effectively used in yak breeding due to its male infertility resulted from spermatogenic arrest. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis to determine the expression profiles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) from cattleyak and yak testis. A total of 604 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs (135 upregulated and 469 downregulated) were identified in cattleyak with respect to yak. Through gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, we identified several DE lncRNAs regulating the mitotic cell cycle processes by targeting the genes significantly associated with the mitotic cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage checkpoint term and also significantly involved in p53 signaling pathway, mismatch repair and homologous recombination pathway (P < 0.05). The reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of the randomly selected fourteen DE lncRNAs and the seven target genes validated the RNA-seq data and their true expressions during spermatogenesis in vivo. Molecular cloning and sequencing indicated that the testis lncRNAs NONBTAT012170 and NONBTAT010258 presented higher similarity among different cattleyak and yak individuals. The downregulation of these target genes in cattleyak contributed to the abnormal DNA replication and spermatogenic arrest during the S phase of mitotic cell cycle. This study provided a novel insight into lncRNA expression profile changes associated with spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak.

AB A simple, sensitive and cost-effective homogeneous catalysis photochemical vapor generation (PVG) system for HPLC separation and atomic fluorescence spectrometry detection was reported herein for the speciation analysis of trace Se(iv) and Se(vi). Homogeneous Cd ions as a catalyst were stable and reliable, without complex nanomaterial synthesis and coating. Under the conditions of 60 mu g mL(-1) Cd ions, 3.5 m reaction coil, 40% acetic acid and 0.30 mL min(-1) of 5 mM Na2CO3-1.3 mM NaHCO3, the online HPLC-Cd-PVG-AFS system enabled us to achieve a calculated detection limit of 0.16 and 0.21 ng mL(-1) for Se(iv) and Se(vi), respectively. Moreover, it could also work successfully even in a phosphate separation system. Under the optimized conditions of 60 mu g mL(-1) Cd ions, 5 m reaction coil, 40% acetic acid and 0.35 mL min(-1) of 50 mM Na2HPO3, a detection limit of 0.49/0.78 ng mL(-1) for Se(iv)/Se(vi) was achieved.

AB Intramuscular fat contributes to the improvement of meat quality of goats. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate adipocyte differentiation and maturation. The aim of our study was to clarify whether miR-10a-5p regulates goat intramuscular preadipocyte (GIPC) differentiation and its direct downstream signaling pathway. GIPCs were isolated from longissimus dorsi, whose miR-10a-5p level was measured at different time point of differentiation induction. Adipogenic differentiation of the GIPCs was evaluated by Oil Red O and BODIPY staining, and the expression changes of adipogenic genes like ACC, ATGL, CEBP beta, PPAR gamma, etc. Related mechanisms were verified by qPCR, a bioinformatic analysis, a dual-luciferase reporter assay, overexpression, and siRNA transfection. Oil Red O and BODIPY staining both with adipogenic gene detection showed that miR-10a-5p suppressed the accumulation of lipid droplets in GIPCs and inhibited its differentiation. The dual-luciferase reporter assay experiment revealed that miR-10a-5p regulates GIPC differentiation by directly binding to KLF8 3'UTR to regulate its expression. Thus, the results indicated that miR-10a-5p inhibits GIPC differentiation by targeting KLF8 and supply a new target for fat deposition and meat quality improvement.

AB Multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) is a recent proposed intelligent algorithm, in which the optimization process can be regarded as the multi-scale quantum annealing process with respect to the constraint of the harmonic oscillator potential well. It has been proved effective and efficient to deal with unimodal and multimodal numerical optimization problems. However, it takes a long time for the particles system to reach the ground-state equilibrium at each annealing scale. Motivated by this situation, a diffusion Monte Carlo method based dynamic sampling regulation strategy is proposed to enhances the sampling efficiency by dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency. Moreover, the particles with different kinetic energies are introduced into the optimization system as quantum perturbations, which reduces the probability of the algorithm falling into a local optimum by keeping the different searching scales simultaneously. The theoretical derivations of this method are presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm is studied by comparing it with previous versions of the MQHOA and several famous intelligent algorithms on uniand multimodal benchmark functions. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has a comparable performance for numerical optimization problems.

AB The mannose receptor (MAN-R)-targeted delivery system is commonly used to deliver antigens to macrophages or immature dendritic cells (DCs) to promote the efficiency of antigen presentation. To maximize the enhancement effects of chitosan (CS) and induce an efficient humoral and cellular immune response against an antigen, we encapsulated ovalbumin (OVA) in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MPs) and conjugated it with MAN-modified CS to obtain MAN-R-targeting nano-MPs (MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs). The physicochemical properties, drug loading rate, and immunomodulation activity of MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs were evaluated. In vitro, MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs (80 mu g mL(-1)) could enhance the proliferation of DCs and increase their phagocytic efficiency. In vivo, MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs significantly increased the ratio of CD3(+)CD4(+)/CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells, increased CD80(+), CD86(+), and MHC II expression in DCs, and improved OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies. Moreover, MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs promoted cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-6) production in mice. Taken together, our results show that MAN-CS-OVA-PLGA-MPs may act by activating the T cells to initiate an immune response by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and improving their antigen presentation efficiency.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzo[b]furans has been developed by palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of 2-halobenzo[b]furans with aryl, alkynyl, and alkylaluminum reagents. Various 2-aryl-, 2-alkynyl-, and 2-alkyl-substituted benzo[b]furan derivatives can be obtained in 23-97% isolated yields using 2-3 mol% PdCl (2) /4-6 mol% XantPhos as the catalyst under mild reaction conditions. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in 2-halobenzo[b]furans gave products in 40-97% isolated yields. In addition, aluminum reagents containing thienyl, furanyl, trimethylsilanyl, and benzyl groups worked efficiently with 2-halobenzo[b]furans as well, and three bioactive molecules with 2-substituted benzo[b]furan skeleton were synthesized. Furthermore, the broad substrates scope and the typical maintenance of vigorous efficiency on gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize 2-substituted benzo[b]furan derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible catalytic cycle has been proposed.

AB MicroRNAs are a class of highly conserved and widely distributed non-coding RNAs. It is known that miR-26b has a high abundance in adipose tissue and is considered to be an effective regulator of adipogenesis. However, it is unclear whether miR-26b-5p, the product of miR-26b precursor, has the same effect as miR-26b. In the present study, we explored the potential role of miR-26b-5p in preadipocyte differentiation of goats. We found that the expression of miR-26b-5p had dramatic change during goat intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation. Transfection and RT-qPCR revealed that overexpression of miR-26b-5p increased the level of adipogenic marker genes and lipid accumulation in goat preadipocyte, suggesting that miR-26b-5p positively regulates goat preadipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and dual fluorescein reporter assays were performed to predict and validate the targets of miR-26b-5p. The results showed that miR-26b-5p has a binding site in the 3 ' UTR of FGF21 and overexpression of miR-26b-5p significantly down-regulated the expression of FGF21 mRNA. Luciferase activity assays confirmed that miR-26b-5p is a positive regulator of goat intramuscular preadipocyte via targeting FGF21. These findings provide reference for further revealing of the regulatory networks of goat fat metabolism and contribute to a better understanding of intramuscular fat deposition in goats.

AB The efficient selectivity of heavy metal ions from wastewater is still challenging but gains great public attention in water treatment on a world scale. In this study, the novel disulfide cross-linked poly(methacrylic acid) iron oxide (Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA) nanoparticles with selective adsorption, improved adsorption capability, and economic reusability were designed and prepared for selective adsorption of Pb(II) ions in aqueous solution. In this study, nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to study the chemophysical properties of Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA. The effect of different factors on adsorption properties of the Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA nanoparticles for Co(II) and Pb(II) ions in aqueous solution was explored by batch adsorption experiments. For adsorption mechanism investigation, the adsorption of Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA for Co(II) and Pb(II) ions can be better fitted by a pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption process of Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA for Co(II) and Pb(II) matches well with the Freundlich isotherm equation. Notably, in the adsorption experiments, the Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA nanoparticles were demonstrated to have a maximum adsorption capacity of 48.7 mg.g(-1) on Pb(II) ions with a selective adsorption order of Pb2+ > Co2+ > Cd2+ > Ni2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ > K+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ in the selective experiments. In the regeneration experiments, the Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA nanoparticles could be easily recovered by desorbing heavy metal ions from the adsorbents with eluents and showed good adsorption capacity for Co(II) and Pb(II) after eight recycles. In brief, compared to other traditional nanoadsorbents, the as-prepared Fe3O4@S-S/PMAA with improved adsorption capability and high regeneration efficiency demonstrated remarkable affinity for adsorption of Pb(II) ions, which will provide a novel technical platform for selective removal of heavy metal ions from actual polluted water.

AB Drug-induced hepatitis (DIH), which seriously interferes with disease treatment, is one of the most common reasons for termination of new drugs during preclinical studies or post-marketing surveillance. Although antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents are promising, their nonspecific distribution and insolubility limit their application. Therefore, precise drug release at the disease site is an important way to alleviate DIH and avoid side effects.
   Methods: A gripper-like hydrophilic cyclic phenylboronic acid (cPBA) was synthesized and a nanoprodrug (cPBA-BE) was established by coupling cPBA with hydrophobic baicalein (BE). The stimuli-responsive release properties and therapeutic effect of cPBA-BE on drug-injured hepatocyte were investigated. The biodistribution and therapeutic effect of cPBA-BE both in acetaminophen-induced acute hepatitis model and rifampicin-induced chronic hepatitis model were further evaluated.
   Results: cPBA-BE conjugate could self-assemble into nanoprodrug with cPBA as the hydrophilic external layer and BE as the hydrophobic core. In HepaRG cells, cPBA-BE showed stronger cellular uptake. Due to the H2O2- and acid-sensitivity, cPBA-BE could achieve adequate BE release, significantly resist the depletion of GSH, mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of inflammation and cell apoptosis in the acetaminophen injured HepaRG cells. Biodistribution showed that cPBA-BE specifically increased the concentration of BE in the liver of DIH mice. cPBA-BE could alleviate acetaminophen-induced acute hepatitis or rifampicin-induced chronic hepatitis more effectively through relieving the oxidative stress, inflammation and block the neutrophil infiltration in liver.
   Conclusions: cPBA is expected to be a good platform for constructing injectable nanoprodrug with both H2O2 and pH-responsive properties by coupling a wide range of drugs containing o-diol. In this study, the nanoprodrug cPBA-BE was determined to be effective for alleviating the DIH.

AB Previous work led to the proposal that the precision feeding of a high-concentrate diet may represent a potential method with which to enhance feed efficiency (FE) when rearing dairy heifers. However, the physiological and metabolic mechanisms underlying this approach remain unclear. This study used metabolomics analysis to investigate the changes in plasma metabolites of heifers precision-fed diets containing a wide range of forage to concentrate ratios. Twenty-four half-sib Holstein heifers, with a similar body condition, were randomly assigned into four groups and precision fed with diets containing different proportions of concentrate (20%, 40%, 60% and 80% based on DM). After 28 days of feeding, blood samples were collected 6 h after morning feeding and gas chromatography time-of-flight/MS was used to analyze the plasma samples. Parameters of oxidative status were also determined in the plasma. The FE (after being corrected for gut fill) increased linearly (P< 0.01) with increasing level of dietary concentrate. Significant changes were identified for 38 different metabolites in the plasma of heifers fed different dietary forage to concentrate ratios. The main pathways showing alterations were clustered into those relating to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism; all of which have been previously associated with FE changes in ruminants. Heifers fed with a high-concentrate diet had higher (P< 0.01) plasma total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase but lower (P <= 0.02) hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide than heifers fed with a low-concentrate diet, which might indicate a lower plasma oxidative status in the heifers fed a high-concentrate diet. Thus, heifers fed with a high-concentrate diet had higher FE and antioxidant capacity but a lower plasma oxidative status as well as changed carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Our findings provide a better understanding of how forage to concentrate ratios affect FE and metabolism in the precision-fed growing heifers.

AB Known as the 'ship of the plateau', through thousands of years evolution and cruelty environments selection containing low oxygen and strong ultraviolet radiation, yaks have adapted plateau environments and supplied important goods and materials for the people in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of yaks for the Plateau adaptation and their underlying co-expression and regulatory network. We carried out RNA-seq analysis for cerebral and cerebellar tissue specimens ofBos taurus,Bos grunniens x Bos TaurusandB. grunniens. Furthermore, 12,072 pseudo lncRNAs were predicted using three software. In total, 4,257 significant DE transcripts were identified using the Ballgown R package (p < .01), of which 1,021 were protein-coding genes, 14 were known lncRNAs, and 661 were novel lncRNAs. Using WGCNA, a co-expression network of DE mRNAs and lncRNAs comprising 5 modules was generated to determine functional associations clusters. This study reveals a valuable sub-network comprising 8 hub genes, one known lncRNA and 5 novel lncRNAs in the major module. These hub genes are associated with blood pressure regulation, generation of reactive oxygen species and metabolism. The analysis of co-expressed genes thus provides a basis for the regulatory mechanisms in PA in Yaks and for the detection of additional genes between cross-breed and parent populations.

AB This paper further investigates the stability analysis of delayed neural networks (DNNs) with data packet dropouts. Firstly, the delay-product-type function method is introduced to construct a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with delay-dependent matrices, which fully considers the integral terms, non-integral terms and time-delay correlation terms. Then, by applying free-matrix-base inequality (FMBI) and other valid inequalities mathematical analysis techniques, new stability criteria are established. Meanwhile, by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the corresponding controllers are designed to ensure the system state stabilization. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The poor environmental friendliness, low adsorption capacity and nonreusability of adsorbents are still challenging for the removal of pollutants in aqueous solution. Herein, novel polypeptide-functionalized silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (PS-MNPs), Fe3O4@SiO2@PLL nanoparticles, with good environmental friendliness, excellent adsorption capability and economic reusability were designed and prepared for efficient removal of methylene blue (MB) and Cr(VI) ion (Cr2O72-). The chem-physical properties of Fe3O4@SiO2@PLL nanoparticles, such as chemical structure, nanosize, nanomorphology, crystalline structure, magnetization and thermo-oxidative degradation behavior were fully investigated in this study. In addition, the adsorption properties of the Fe3O4@SiO2@PLL nanoparticles for MB and Cr(VI) ion in aqueous solution were explored by batch adsorption experiments. Based on the experimental results, the Fe3O4@SiO2@PLL nanoparticles demonstrated excellent adsorption capacity for removal of both MB and Cr(VI) ion that the theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of the nanoparticles were 301.2 mg.g(-1) for MB and 164.7 mg.g(-1 )for Cr(VI), respectively. The adsorption process could be better fitted by pseudo-second-order model, and matched well with the Langmuir isotherm equation. Moreover, the Fe3O4@SiO2@PLL nanoparticles could be easily regenerated by desorbing metal ions and organic dyes from the adsorbents with appropriate eluents, and showed good adsorption capacity after five recycles. In brief, the as-prepared PS-MNPs exhibited improved environmental friendliness, excellent adsorption properties and high regeneration efficiency, which could be used as a potential adsorbent for different kinds of contaminants removal.

AB Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases worldwide, and it has no effective treatment. We previously reported that the native polypeptide vglycin (purified from soybean) has a beneficial role in regulating glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of vglycin and possible mechanisms of action in hepatic steatosis using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model. The results revealed that vglycin decreased the body weight, liver weight, Lee's index, and plasma triglyceride level in HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice. Furthermore, it prevented liver injury, inflammation and insulin resistance by inhibiting fat accumulation in liver. These beneficial effects of vglycin are probably attributable to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the down-regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS). Therefore, vglycin holds promise as an oral drug for the prevention of NAFLD.

AB This study aimed at exploring the active components and mechanisms of Jinhua Qinggan granules (JQG) in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. These efforts were accomplished by employing the holistic approach of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and considering the virus-host interaction consisting of viral characteristics, the entry pathway into the host, and the resulting immune response. The chemical constituents and molecular targets of the 12 herbs from JQG were obtained using the TCM Systems Pharmacology database and analysis platform. UniProt was used to search for genes corresponding to JQG protein targets and Cytoscape 3.7.2 to construct the component-target (gene) network. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform enrichment analysis of gene ontology functions and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways to predict the mechanism of action. The components ranked high in the network, and the major active components of the principal medicines, based on published literature, were docked with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolase, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein), angiotensin conversion enzyme II (ACE2), and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). Visualization analysis demonstrated that the core active components of JQG had a strong affinity for SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase, SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2, and SOCS1. These data imply that the potential active components of JQG may act on multiple signaling pathways by binding to targets such as SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase, S protein, ACE2, and SOCS1, thereby inhibiting virus replication and targeting cell binding, reducing host inflammation, and activating antiviral immunity to a certain extent.

AB Elastic optical networks (EONs) can make service accommodation more flexible and precise by employing efficient routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) algorithms. In order to improve the efficiency of RSA algorithms, the advanced-reservation technique was introduced into designing RSA algorithms. However, few of these advanced-reservation-based RSA algorithms were focused on the unavailable spectrum resources in EONs. In this paper, we propose an Advanced-Reservation-based Invalid-Spectrum-Aware (AR-ISA) resource allocation algorithm to improve the networking performance and the resource alignment of EONs. By employing a new index, Invalid Spectrum Rate (ISR), to record the proportion of unavailable spectrum resources in EONs, the proposed AR-ISA algorithm set a network load threshold to trigger the postponement of an arriving service. Compared with the traditional slack-based AR mechanism, the proposed algorithm has more concerns about the current spectrum usage of the path designated by the service than the conflicts between AR services and other existing services. To further increase the networking performance, the proposed algorithm adopts defragmentation to increase the number of available spectrum resources when postponing a service. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed AR-ISA algorithm has obvious effectiveness in reducing the service blocking rate and increasing the spectrum alignment rate.

AB The stator winding structure of the main exciter of the brushless synchronous starter/generator (BSSG) is changed at high speed for flux weakening, leading to a sudden excitation decrease of the main generator (MG) of BSSG. Consequently, when proportional-integral (PI) current loop-based control strategies are applied, large current overshoots will occur due to the lack of fast current control ability. This paper adopts model predictive current control (MPCC) to replace PI current control for a better dynamic performance. Besides, a parameter estimation scheme, based on the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm, is proposed to provide MG parameters for MPCC. An effectiveness analysis of the RLS algorithm is performed and two rules are given. According to the two rules, rather than the parameter dynamic characteristics adopted by traditional methods, three MG parameters, dq-axes inductances, and excitation flux linkage are estimated with two decoupled RLS estimators. In addition, a method is proposed to adjust the forgetting factor to track fast changing parameters of MG when the excitation changes suddenly. With the estimated parameters, MPCC is conducted to start BSSG. Experimental results show that fast current control of MG is achieved and large current overshoots caused by the sudden excitation change are avoided.

AB The graphene/PPy fiber nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method. Moved by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the tetra-functional NiPcTs and PPy chain, a self-sorting mechanism acts to align the PPy chains to form one-dimensional PPy nanofibers on graphene. The in situ grown nanostructure possesses a good interconnectivity and porosity facilities. The well-designed microstructure of the composites achieves a synergistic effect between the graphene and PPy and shows a good electrochemical performance for supercapacitors of 316 F g(-1) even at a high current density of 5 A g(-1).

AB In this paper, we investigate price and order strategies for innovative green products using demand forecasting and sharing. We formulate the problem using a Stackelberg game and propose a dynamic contract that specifies an initial wholesale price, a minimum order quantity, a demand sharing agreement, and a decisions adjustment agreement. We arrived at the following main findings and implications. First, the manufacturer offers a higher or lower wholesale price than the initial one depending on the variation in the market status. Also, the retailer's ordering decisions will increase with the wholesale price, which contradicts the common assumption that ordering decisions decrease with the wholesale price. Interestingly, if the market improves, the manufacturer obtains a higher profit margin than the retailer; if the market worsens, the manufacturer suffers more loss of profit margin than the retailer. Second, when the cost of information sharing is smaller than an upper bound, demand forecasting and sharing are always beneficial to the manufacturer. However, the value of demand forecasting and sharing for the retailer is significantly affected by the market status variation. Third, high information accuracy will not necessarily increase the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, even if the market status is better than expected. Finally, numerical examples show the parameters' effects. We have several main managerial insights. When the shared demand information is received from the retailer, the manufacturer can determine wholesale price strategies according to the retailer's demand forecast. Moreover, if the manufacturer wants to ensure profitability, they should not choose retailers with a higher capability of demand forecasting.

TI Weighted Deep Forest for Schizophrenia Data Classification

AB There is no objective biological indicator for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Machine learning is used to classify functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the aim of which is to effectively improve the reliability of diagnostics for schizophrenia. The following points are often considered: 1) Extracting effective features from fMRI data. 2) Choosing an appropriate machine learning method. 3) Improving classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a weighted deep forest model, which includes a weighted class vector, and a prediction class vector. In our experiment, we extract functional connection (FC) features from fMRI data. Then, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of FC features. For datasets with unbalanced data, we use SMOTE to balance the data. Finally, the datasets with balanced data are fed into the weighted forest model. Compared with the classification results obtained by traditional classifiers, our classification accuracy is better. This method will provide greater possibilities for assisting doctors in diagnosing schizophrenia. This paper has significance for the study of schizophrenia by helping doctors diagnose the disease.

AB A bismuth-catalyzed methylation of quinones in the presence of tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) was developed via a radical reaction mechanism. Particularly, TBPB was used not only as an efficient oxidant, but also as a green methyl source in such transformation. Moreover, this method could also be efficiently extended to the alkylation of quinones. This reaction tolerated a series of functional groups and prepared a series of derivatives of vitamin K-3 and benzoquinone. Notably, antimalarial parvaquone was synthesized by the reaction.

AB This study was performed to investigate the prevalence and genetic variation of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Tibetan pigs and to determine its ability to infect mice. A total of 38 out of 229 (16.59%; 95% CI = 12.00%-22.10%) fecal samples from Tibetan pigs from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 2018 were positive for HEV RNA, which was detected by RT-nPCR. Significantly different detection rates were observed between samples from diarrheic and clinically healthy animals (OR = 9.56; 95% CI, 2.84-32.14; p < 0.001), suggesting a potential association between HEV infection and diarrhea in Tibetan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HEV isolates were clustered into subtypes 4a (31 samples), 4b (1), 4d (2), and 4j (4). HEV-4a was the predominant subtype, indicating that it might be circulating in Tibetan pigs. Nine complete HEV genome sequences obtained from Tibetan pigs were found by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to those of genotype 4 HEV isolates from humans. Two recombinant events were identified in both HEV-4a strains; a novel recombination breakpoint was first identified at the 3' end of the ORF2 region in the SWU/L9/2018 strain, and a common recombination region was found at the junction of the ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the SWU/31-12/2018 strain. Furthermore, HEV-4a could be detected in all BALB/c mice that were experimentally infected by gavage and contact exposure. The information presented here about the prevalence and genotype diversity of HEV from Tibetan pigs provides important insights into the epidemic features of HEV on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB A iron-catalyzed free radical cascade reaction of allyl alcohols with N-substituted maleimides for accessing poly-substituted gamma-butyrolactones has been developed. In this protocol, various allyl alcohols can open N-substituted maleimide rings to form allyl ester intermediates, and the allyl ester intermediates can be converted into an allyl ester alkyl radicals and undergo intramolecular free radical addition cyclization to form a polysubstituted gamma-butyrolactones. In this protocol, spiro gamma-butyrolactone compounds can be also synthesized. Meanwhile, the strategy could be applied to further construct a fully substituted tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is not sensitive to oxygen or moisture and has been performed on gram-scale.

AB The purpose of present study was to investigate the prevalence and genetic variation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Tibetan pigs on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 2018. The PCR yielded a significantly high detection rate (38.34%, 95%CI = 31.5-45.6%) for PEDV from 193 fecal samples from Tibetan pigs. The novel PEDVs were discovered in Tibetan pigs and seven complete S genes were obtained and analyzed. The unique multiple mutations were detected in S genes of PEDV from Tibetan pigs, one of which led to a new amino acid substitution of a neutralizing epitope. Phylogenetic analysis showed that seven S genes had significant genetic distance to other PEDV. Specially, two S genes formed a novel subgroup on the genogroup 2 (G2) branch, of which same recombination event occurred between different strains from genotype G2. The remaining five S genes formed a new subgroup on the G1 branch, among which distinct recombination events occurred between genotypes G1 and G2 strains. The result indicated that the new recombination events were detected in the S genes of PEDV from Tibetan pigs, which could be circulating in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Notably, the four complete PEDV genomes obtained in this study had an identical recombination region spanning S2, ORF3 and E genes. This is the first report of the crossover regional recombination event in PEDV genome. Our findings not only augmented current understanding of the genetic evolution of PEDV, but also indicated that new variants of PEDV strains have been emerging in Tibetan pigs.

AB Recently, we have carried out a detailed Raman analysis to investigate the inhomogeneous crystallization of a-Si thin films irradiated by femtosecond (Fs) laser. As expected, there are many etched spots overlapping each other, which features the surface morphology of the irradiated films. It is observed clearly that there has generated an inhomogeneous crystallization inside a-Si thin film induced by Fs laser, and the crystalline volume fraction in one irradiated spot varies depending on different areas from the center to the edge. It is hard to observe any crystallization at the spot center where maximum energy of Fs laser is injected; however, there is an increasing crystalline volume fraction when the site varies from the center to the edge of the irradiated spot. More importantly, as the site varies from the center to the edge, the TO mode of Si nanocrystals (NCs; first-order Si-Si peak at similar to 520.5 cm(-1)) is asymmetrically broadened towards the low wavenumber and exhibits a dip on the high wavenumber. A model has been proposed to explain this inhomogeneous crystallization inside the a-Si thin films induced by Fs laser, and both phonon confinement model and Fano model have been employed to discuss the origin of asymmetric line shapes of TO mode of Si NCs, and we prefer to attribute the asymmetry of TO mode to Fano effect. Our present research results provide a deep insight into the origin of asymmetric broadening for the Raman TO mode of Si NCs inside a-Si thin films irradiated by Fs laser.

AB What is known and objective Clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of ipilimumab has led to considerable improvements in the clinical outcome in patients with advanced melanoma. We conducted a meta-analysis to systematically review the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab for advanced melanoma. Study design The relevant randomized controlled trials in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab were retrieved, and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for articles published till May 2018. Results A total of 16 reports from 12 trials were available for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis provided evidence that the combination of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors and ipilimumab was more effective in improving progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) than either agent alone. However, ipilimumab was inferior to PD-1 inhibitors in improving PFS, OS and ORR. The combination of ipilimumab and anticancer therapy was superior to ipilimumab alone in improving ORR and was superior to anticancer therapy alone in improving OS, PFS and ORR. The adverse events associated with ipilimumab therapy were generally manageable. What is new and conclusion This is the largest and most up-to-date meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in treating advanced melanoma. The ipilimumab-containing therapy was efficacious in treating advanced melanoma with a manageable safety profile.

AB The 0-1 knapsack problem is a typical discrete combinatorial optimization problem with numerous applications. In this paper, a binary multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (BMQHOA) with genetic operator is proposed for solving 0-1 knapsack problem. The framework of BMQHOA is consisted of three nested phases including energy level stablization, energy level decline and scale adjustment. In BMQHOA, the number of different bits between solutions is defined as the distance between solutions to map the continuous search space into the discrete search space. Repair operator with greedy strategy is adopted in BMQHOA to guarantee the knapsack capacity constraint. The current best solution is used to perform a random mutation with the origin solutions, making solutions evolve towards the current optimal solution. The performance of BMQHOA is evaluated on two low-dimensional and three high-dimensional KP01 data sets, and computational results are compared with several state-of-art 0-1 knapsack algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BMQHOA can get the best solutions of most knapsack data sets, and performs well on convergence and stability.

AB Plant-based natural products represent an alternative to chemical compounds for the control of mites in veterinary medicine. Here, the essential oil of Elsholtzia densa (E. densa) Benth was extracted using hydrodistillation at a rate of 1.2%. The chemical composition of the essential oil was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The GC-MS analysis indicated that the principal compounds in the volatile oil of the sample were 4-Pyridinol (28.16%) and thymol (26.58%). The acaricidal activity of E. densa oil against Sarcoptes scabiei (S. scabiei) was tested in vitro. Toxicity test data were analysed using a complementary log-log (CLL) model. The E. densa oil was prepared in five concentrations by dilution with liquid paraffin (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/ml) and exhibited strong toxicity against S. scabiei with LT50 values of 16.637, 5.075, 2.884, 1.184 and 0.760 h, respectively. The LC50 values were 7.678, 4.623, 2.543, 1.502, 1.298 and 0.981 mg/ml for S. scabiei at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h, respectively. Compared to the control, the essential oil showed significant effects against S. scabiei in vitro. At 16 mg/ml, E. densa oil was found to kill all mites within a 16-h period. The results indicate that E. densa oil possesses potential acaricidal activity in vitro and may be exploited as a novel drug for the effective control of S. scabiei.

AB Water is a basic necessity and its allocation and utilization, especially pricing policies, impose various social, economic, and ecological impacts on social groups. Increasing block tariffs (IBTs) has gained popularity because it is expected to incentivize water conservation while protecting poor people benefiting from the redistribution effects because of its nonlinear tariff structure. However, it results in price distortion under certain circumstances. Researchers have also proposed an alternative practical price system and a uniform tariff with rebate (UTR), with the price level set equal to the marginal social cost and a fixed rebate allocated to the poor groups. This study proceeds with a simulation of the two pricing systems, UTR and IBTs, and empirically explores their fundamental merits and limitations. The results confirm the theoretical perspective that a water price system, compared with an optimal tariff system, simultaneously achieves multiple goals to the greatest possible extent.

AB Undoped, Na-doped, and Na-F codoped ZnO films were synthesized using sol-gel method. Na+ and F+ ions were used as two different dopants that yielded a synergistic doping effect. This effect was measurable using XRD, accompanied by a redshift in the optical bandgap from 3.284 to 3.261 eV in ZnO, ZnO-F, and ZnO-Na-F thin films, respectively. We then studied the resulting photoluminescent changes, which were attributed to O-related defects. Ferromagnetism measurements revealed that magnetic orderings decreased significantly with F doping. However, increased Na doping enhanced the oxygen-vacancy mediated ferromagnetic state.

AB (CaBi4Ti4O15)(1-x)(Bi4Ti3O12)(x) (CBT-xBIT) Aurivillius phase ceramics were synthesized by the conventional solid reaction method. The evolution of the structure and the electrical properties of CBT-xBIT ceramics were systematically investigated. Due to the enhanced spontaneous polarization induced by internal stresses on the Bi2O2 layers in the CBT-xBIT structure, the optimal piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) similar to 13 pC/N) was obtained in the ceramics with x = 0.3 while exhibiting a relatively good thermal stability in the temperature range of 20-700 degrees C. The dc resistivity (rho(dc)) of the CBT-xBIT ceramics exhibited a higher value (>= 10(9) Omega cm) at room temperature, and the tan delta value of CBT-xBIT (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.3) within the temperature range of 20-500 degrees C maintained stability as a result of the domain structure and point defect concentration in the ceramics. In addition, a distinctive double dielectric peak anomaly was observed in the epsilon(r)-T curves of the CBT-xBIT (x = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) ceramics, and it plays a remarkable role in the thermal stability of the piezoelectricity of CBT-xBIT ceramics.

AB In Haemophilus parasuis, the rfa cluster has been identified as a virulence-associated factor that is involved in lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis. In this study, we assessed the roles of rfaD and rfaF genes in H. parasuis SC096 on LOS-induced pro-inflammatory factors and the related signaling pathways in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) by real-time PCR and western blotting. The results showed that the LOSs of both rfaD and rfaF mutants (Delta rfaD-LOS and Delta rfaF-LOS) significantly decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha) in PAMs compared with H. parasuis SC096 LOS (WT-LOS). Furthermore, in Delta rfaD-LOS-and Delta rfaF-LOS-treated cells, I kappa B alpha degradation was significantly inhibited and levels of phospho-p65 and phospho-p38 were significantly reduced in PAMs. These findings suggested that the rfaD and rfaF genes mediated LOS induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PAMs by regulating the NF-kappa B and MAPKs signaling pathways during H. parasuis infection.

AB Contents To increase the current understanding of the gene expression in the pre-ovulatory ovary and identify the key genes involved in the regulation of ovulation rate, we compared the transcriptomes of ovaries from the prolific Jintang black goat (JTG) and the non-prolific Tibetan goat (TBG) during the follicular phase using the Illumina RNA-Seq method. Three ovarian libraries were constructed for each breed. On average, we obtained approximately 49.2 and 45.9million reads for each individual ovary of TBGs and JTGs, respectively, of which 79.76% and 78.67% reads were covered in the genome database. A total of 407 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were detected between these two breeds, in which 316 were upregulated, and 91 were downregulated in the ovaries of JTGs versus TBGs. Based on the results of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, some of these DEGs potentially play an important role in controlling the development of ovarian follicles. SRD5A2, MSMB, STAR and 3BHSD, etc. were the most significantly differentially expressed between these two distinct breeds. In addition, each ovary expressed 1,066 versus 989 novel transcripts, and 171,829 versus 140,529 putative SNPs in TBGs versus JTBs, respectively. All data sets (GEO and dbSNP) were available via public repositories. Our study provides insight into the transcriptional regulation of the ovaries of two distinct breeds of goats that might serve as a key resource for understanding goat fecundity. SRD5A2, MSMB, STAR and 3BHSD may be associated with the high fecundity of JTGs.

AB To obtain the mixed weak object signal against the super power signal (jamming) is still an challenging task in modern communication systems. In this paper, a novel framework is designed for weak object signal blind separation against the strong interference signal. To extract the strong interference signal,firstly, we separate the mixed signals with the optimized FastICA algorithm, then, an improved Interference Cancellation algorithm is proposed as reference signal based on the separated strong signal. Next, we separate the weak mixed signals by the improved FastICA algorithm again. Finally, we discuss the performance of the proposed method and verify the novel method based on several simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

AB As a component of self-regulation, delay discounting (DD) refers to an individual's tendency to prefer smaller-but-sooner rewards over larger-but-later rewards and plays an essential role in many aspects of human behavior. Although numerous studies have examined the neural underpinnings of DD in adults, there are far fewer studies focusing on the neurobiological correlates underlying DD in adolescents. Here, we investigated the associations between individual differences in DD and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 228 high school students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RSfMRI). At the regional level, we found an association between higher DD and greater fALFF in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is involved in conflict monitoring and strategy adaptation. At the connectivity level, DD was positively correlated with the RSFC between the dACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a critical functional circuit in the cognitive control network. Furthermore, these effects persisted even after adjusting for the influences of general intelligence and trait impulsivity. Overall, this study reveals the fALFF and RSFC as the functional brain basis of DD in late adolescents, aiding to strengthen and corroborate our understanding of the neural underpinnings of DD.

AB The development of gene delivery vectors with high efficiency and biocompatibility is one of the critical points of gene therapy. Two biodegradable poly(amino ester)s were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization between low molecular weight (LMW) PEI and diepoxide. The molecular weights of poly(amino ester) s were measured by GPC. Agarose gel retardation assays showed that these materials have good DNA-binding ability and can retard the electrophoretic mobility of plasmid DNA (pDNA) at a weight ratio of 1. The formed polyplexes have proper sizes of around 200 nm and zeta-potential values of about 30-40 mV for cellular uptake. In vitro experiments revealed that polymer P2 gave higher transfection efficiency than PEI 25 KDa and Lipofectamine 2000 with less toxicity, especially in 293 cells. Results demonstrate that such a type of degradable poly(amino ester) may serve as a promising non-viral gene vector.

AB The goal of this research was to evaluate the anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities of three compounds extracted and purified from Herpetospermum seeds (HS) on HepG2.2.15 cells. Herpetin (HPT), herpetone (HPO), and herpetfluorenone (HPF) were isolated from HS and identified using HR-ESI-MS and NMR. Different concentrations of the drugs were added to the HepG2.2.15 cells. Cell toxicity was observed with an MTT assay, cell culture supernatants were collected, and HBsAg and HBeAg were detected by ELISA. The content of HBV DNA was determined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fluorescent probes. The 50% toxicity concentration (TC50) of HPF was 531.48 mu g/mL, suggesting that this species is less toxic than HPT and HPO. HPT and HPF showed more potent antiviral activities than HPO. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) values of HPF on HBsAg and HBeAg were 176.99 and 134.53 mu g/mL, respectively, and the corresponding therapeutic index (TI) values were 2.66 and 3.49, respectively. HPT and HPF were shown to significantly reduce the level of HBV DNA in the HepG2.2.15 culture medium compared to the negative control. This initial investigation of the anti-HBV constituents of HS yielded three compounds that revealed a synergistic effect of multiple components in the ethnopharmacological use of HS.

AB The extracellular stability versus intracellular drug release and the long blood stream circulation versus enhanced cell uptake are two dilemmas for micellar drug delivery systems. To resolve the above two problems, a novel core cross-linked polyurethane micelles with redox sensitive and pH-responsive surface charge switchable properties were prepared and investigated as anti-cancer drug carriers. Firstly, amphiphilic multi-blocked polyurethane with pendant carboxyl groups and disulfides in the hard segment (PU-SS-COOH) was synthesized. Afterwards, 1,6-diaminohexane was connected onto some of the pendant carboxyl groups via dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) condensation, which resulted in polyurethane with pendant amine and carboxyl groups (PU-SS-COOH-NH2). Then the PU-SS-COOH-NH2 was assembled into micelles and the hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate (HDI) was added into the micelle solution. The hydrophobic diisocyanate penetrated into the hydrophobic core of PU micelles and reacted with amine groups, which resulted in core crosslinked PU micelles (PU-CCL). PTX and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) were chosen as model hydrophobic drugs to evaluate the loading and redox-triggered release of the PU micelles. The drug release from the cross-linked polyurethane micelles (PU-CCL) demonstrated that the PU-CCL has superior particle stability compared with the uncross-linked polyurethane micelles in a phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution without reducing agents, whereas the drug release rate is markedly accelerated with the addition of a reducing agent, glutathione (GSH). Notably, PU micelles with both amine and carboxyl groups, i.e. PU-SS-COOH-NH2 and PU-CCL micelles, showed pH-responsive charge switchable properties. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cell uptake of the PTX (or DOX used to illustrate the cell uptake) loaded micelles was also assessed in HepG2 cells. It was found that the redox-sensitive polyurethane micelles can rapidly enter tumor cells. In vitro cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the DOX-loaded PU-CCL display lower cytotoxicity in vitro compared to either free DOX or DOX-loaded uncrosslinked PU micelles. The cross-linked reduction responsive biodegradable micelles, having superior extracellular stability and providing rapid intracellular drug release, may hold great potential as a bio- triggered drug delivery system for cancer therapy.

AB Rennet, a complex of enzymes found in the stomachs of ruminants, is an important component for cheese production. In our study, we described that yak chymosin gene recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could serve as a novel source for rennet production. Yaks total RNA was extracted from the abomasum of an unweaned yak. The yak preprochymosin, prochymosin, and chymosin genes from total RNA were isolated using gene specific primers based on cattle chymosin gene sequence respectively and analyzed their expression pattern byreal time-polymerase chain reaction. The result showed that the chymosin gene expression level of the sucking yaks was 11.45 times higher than one of adult yaks and yak chymosin belongs to Bovidae family in phylogenetic analysis. To express each, the preprochymosin, prochymosin, and chymosin genes were ligated into the expression vector pPICZaA, respectively, and were expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The results showed that all the recombinant clones of P. pastoris containing the preprochymosin, prochymosin or chymosin genes could produce the active form of recombinant chymosin into the culture supernatant. Heterologous expressed prochymosin (14.55 Soxhlet unit/mL) had the highest enzyme activity of the three expressed chymosin enzymes. Therefore, we suggest that the yak chymosin gene recombinant Pichia pastoris strain could provide an alternative source of rennet production.

AB Aims: Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) produces a wide variety of staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) and staphylococcal enterotoxin-like (SEl) proteins, which are the most causative agents of staphylococcal food poisoning. In contrast to classical SEs (SEA to SEE), the relationship between the novel SEs/SEls (SEG to SElX) and staphylococcal food poisoning is not elucidated. This study is aimed to establish a system to detect staphylococcal enterotoxin-like protein I (SElI) for analysis of staphylococcal food poisoning.
   Methods and Results: SElI was characterized in a Staph. aureus clinical isolate associated with food poisoning; there was an amino acid substitution Thr145Ala compared to previously identified SEI from Staph. aureus 04-02981. Subsequently, SElI was expressed, purified, and the poly-and monoclonal antibodies against it were prepared. Using these antibodies, a highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that specifically detected and measured SElI secretion from the Staph. aureus clinical isolate in LB medium, milk and bloodstream was developed.
   Conclusions: The ELISA system has been successfully applied for analysing SElI secretion in vivo and in vitro.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The highly sensitive ELISA should make it attractive for quantifying SElI in food hygiene supervision and clinical diagnosis in near future.

AB Mountainous regions harbor high levels of biodiversity, while often experiencing substantial pressure from agricultural production. Our current understanding of factors driving changes in the highly diverse species assemblages of these regions is generally limited. We used variance partitioning based on redundancy analysis to establish the effects of environmental variables on the species composition of vascular plants and three insect taxa (Geometridae, Arctiinae and Carabidae). These environmental determinants are linked to three distinct spatial levels: the regional level - the four study regions positioned at similar to 400 m altitudinal intervals, the landscape level - the landscape structure in the vicinity of each study plot, and the plot level the environmental conditions. at individual sampling locations. Our results showed that variations in the species composition of vascular plants and carabids were more closely linked to plot-level characteristics than to regional-level factors, while the opposite trend was observed for the two moth taxa. When effects explicitly linked to the four study regions were controlled, plant and carabid assemblages showed strong links to the percentage of semi-natural habitat at the landscape level, while geometrid and arctiinid assemblages were affected primarily by the overall plant species richness and plant coverage at the plot level. Overall, the variations in the species composition of different taxa can be explained by varying sets of environmental variables acting at different spatial scales, and the relative role of these variables is highly taxon-specific. Regional-scale approaches are crucial for biodiversity conservation in mountainous agricultural landscapes, as exemplified by the responses in the two moths taxa, while a high proportion of semi-natural habitats in the agricultural landscape is not only linked to a diverse vegetation, but also to species-rich carabid assemblages.

AB Nine aldehyde reactive dyes, designated D-1- D-9, were synthesized. Among them, D-1 and D-2 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red and alizarin yellow GG, respectively, to the alpha-C of n-butyl-aldehyde; D-3 and D-4 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red and alizarin yellow GG, respectively, to the methyl-C of 4-methyl-cinnamaldehyde; D-5- D-9 were synthesized by "grafting" alizarin red, alizarin yellow GG or self-prepared colorants to the alpha-C of glutaraldehyde. UV-Vis, FTIR, ESI-MS, elemental analysis and H-1 NMR were applied to identify the target products. Aluminum-tanned wet-white sheep leather was chosen as substrate for the application experiments, and their four dyeing property indexes, i.e., substantivity (S), exhaustion (E), fixation (F) and reactivity (R) were measured. The results indicated that, without adding of neutral salts and under mild conditions (T = 35-45 degrees C, pH = 4.0-6.5), all these dyes could dye wet-white leather within 1.5 h, and the dyed leather possessed a satisfactory washing-fastness.

AB In order to investigate characterization and tissue distribution of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), full-length of Myf5, MyoG, Myf6 cDNAs were cloned and expression patterns of MRFs in different tissues were studied. Meanwhile the effect of dietary oil sources (fish oil, FO; linseed oil, LO; groundnut oil, GO; olive oil, OO) on MRFs gene expression in muscle of grass carp were studied by feeding experiment. The results showed that nucleotide sequence of Myf5, MyoG and Myf6 contained a basic DNA-binding motif and a helix-loop-helix dimerization domain (bHLH) respectively. MRFs were mainly expressed in muscle and a little were expressed in other tissues tested. In red muscle MRFs was mostly expressed in OO group and in white muscle they were mostly expressed in GO group. These results showed that MRFs gene and amino acid in grass carp shared high conservation and it mostly expressed in muscle. Dietary oil sources have a great impact on expression of MRFs genes in muscle of grass carp, probably indicating that OO or GO would be more suitable than FO to be oil sources in diet of grass carp.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate effects of beet pulp supplementation on growth performance, fecal moisture, serum hormones and litter performance in lactating sows. Ninety primiparous sows (LandracexYorkshire) were randomly allotted to one of three dietary treatments in a 21-day trial starting 3 days before parturition. The three dietary treatments were supplemented with 0, 10 and 20% beet pulp, respectively. Backfat loss and fecal moisture content were increased (P<0.05), where cortisol and norepinephrine levels were decreased (P<0.05) in sows fed beet pulp supplementation diets compared with control diet, but there was no difference between 10% and 20% beet pulp supplementation treatments. No effect was observed on bodyweight, average daily intake, weaning to estrus interval, epinephrine level in sows and litter weight, litter size, survivability in piglets among dietary treatments. Taken together, beet pulp supplementation has no significant effect of growth performance of lactating sows and piglets with decreased cortisol and norepinephrine levels in lactating sows, but it can increase fecal moisture content which is beneficial for sow feces excretion.

AB This paper reports the successful expression of a lactoferrin gene-obtained from the mammary gland tissue of Tibetan sheep-in the yeast Pichia pastoris GS115 using pPICZ alpha A as the recombinant plasmid and alpha-factor signal sequence for secretion. The recombinant lactoferrin was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange column chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography, and it had a molecular mass of 76 kDa. We obtained an expression yield of >60 mg L-1 and specific activity of 2533.33 U mg(-1). The antimicrobial activities and iron-binding behaviors of recombinant lactoferrin indicated that it was correctly folded and functional. Additionally, recombinant lactoferrin inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli JM109 and Staphylococcus aureus. These findings indicate that recombinant lactoferrin is a potential antibiotic for use on humans. This study also demonstrates the successful expression of recombinant lactoferrin using the eukaryotic host organism P. pastoris, paving the way for protein engineering using this gene.

AB Elymus breviaristatus, a short-lived perennial grass species with ecological importance and forage value, is narrowly distributed in a few locations in the natural grassland of southeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Its populations are declining due to habitat loss and grassland degradation. This project is aim to investigate genetic diversity and genetic structure of this species for its conservation and management, using SSR data obtained from seven natural populations sampled from southeast of QTP. Seventeen selected primer pairs generated a total of 166 polymorphic bands. The Shannon diversity was comparably low within populations (0.115), but higher at the species level (0.251). An obvious population structure and high level of genetic differentiation (AMOVA-derived Phi(ST) = 0.48, G/(ST) = 0.54 from Shannon index) were detected by clustering, principle coordinate analysis and STRCTURE. All clustering approaches supported a demarcation of the seven populations into four major clades which failed to correspond to their geographical origin. The Mantel test revealed no significant isolation by distance (IBD) when used pairwise-Phi(ST) (r = 0.149) as genetic distance, which indicating that geographical separation do not act as barriers for gene flow. Self-fertilization is considered to be the major factor contributing to high genetic divergence within this species. Furthermore, habitat destruction and limited seed dispersal due to increasing anthropogenic pressure on the species may play an important role in shaping present distribution of genetic diversity. Suggestions for conservation strategies are provided to preserve the genetic resources of this species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a metabolic disease arising from abnormal purine metabolism. It contributes to an increased risk of kidney damage. The present study aimed to investigate the uric acid (UA)-lowering effects of Lactobacillus paracasei 259 isolated from yak yogurt and explore its underlying mechanisms. Our results revealed that L. paracasei 259 decreased the UA levels in rats and inhibited the serum activities of xanthine oxidase. In addition, L. paracasei 259 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6) in the kidney and altered the expressions of UA transporters (ABC transporter 2 (ABCG2), PDZ domain containing 1 (PDZK1), urate transporter 1 (URAT1), and sodium-phosphate cotransporter type 4 (NPT4)) to near normal levels. Moreover, it increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the gut and recovered the gut microbiota composition, promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These findings suggested that L. paracasei 259 can potentially be used to decrease UA levels, repair kidney damage, regulate gut microbiota, and alleviate HUA.

AB Potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have attracted significant attention due to the remarkable electrical properties and high Curie temperature. However, the conventional trial-and-error approach for identifying optimal doping combinations to enhance their performance is inefficient and expensive. Therefore, the rapid and precise prediction of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) d 33 ) exhibits great practical significance in the investigation of high-performance piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, an efficient data-driven machine learning (ML) approach is proposed to expedite the development of piezoelectric properties with the (0.92-x)K0.48Na0.52NbO3-xLiTaO3-0.08AgSbO3 x )K 0.48 Na 0.52 NbO 3- x LiTaO 3-0.08AgSbO 3 (KNNAS-xLT) x LT) lead-free ceramic as the model material. Comparison of various ML models containing distributed random forest (DRF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are conducted with a limited dataset consisting of 256 samples and 21 feature elements. Then, the DRF model is identified as the most favorable choice, demonstrating piezoelectric constants which are consistent with the experimental results along with the highest fitting accuracy of 79 %. Based on the coincident result, the mechanism is analyzed with modified phase boundary and polarization finally. This research demonstrates a powerful strategy of machine leaning for achieving high d 33 in KNN ceramics, promoting designing of new materials.

AB The ongoing and progressive evolution of antibiotic resistance presents escalating challenges for the clinical management and prevention of bacterial infections. Understanding the makeup of resistance genomes and accurately quantifying the current abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are crucial for assessing the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to public health. This comprehensive study investigated the distribution and diversity of bacterial community composition, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs) across human, chicken, pig fecal, and soil microbiomes in various provinces of China. As a result, multidrug resistance was identified across all samples. Core ARGs primarily related to multidrug, MLS (Macrolides-Lincosamide-Streptogramins), and tetracycline resistance were characterized. A significant correlation between ARGs and bacterial taxa was observed, especially in soil samples. Probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus harbored ARGs, potentially contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We screened subsets of ARGs from samples from different sources as indicators to assess the level of ARGs contamination in samples, with high accuracy. These results underline the complex relationship between microbial communities, resistance mechanisms, and environmental factors, emphasizing the importance of continued research and monitoring to better understand these dynamics.

   Feature selection; Self-information; Feature significance
AB Multi -label feature selection corresponds to pattern recognition and knowledge mining, and its application has been expanded to different scenarios. As an excellent processing platform for uncertain and ambiguous information, divergence-based fuzzy rough sets (Div-FRSs) have been proposed and applied to feature selection. However, there are three critical problems to be solved when applying Div-FRSs to multi -label learning. The first is how to effectively dispose the noise produced by features in multi -label data. The second is how to synthetically consider the relevance among all labels. The last is how to thoroughly mine the uncertainty brought by upper approximations neglected in Div-FRSs existing researches. To address these issues, this study presents a new divergence-based fuzzy neighborhood rough set model (Div-FNRSs) for multi -label learning using self -information. First, the divergence-based fuzzy neighborhood relation and class are gradually raised to manage the noise in multi -label data, and fuzzy decision is introduced to dispose all labels as a whole. Combining them together, a new model Div-FNRSs is constructed. Then, divergencebased fuzzy neighborhood self -information containing upper approximations and lower approximations is designed to depict distinguishing ability of features through three-level uncertainty measure establishment and granulation property exploration. Furthermore, feature significance for choosing the optimal features is given and it motivates a heuristic feature-selection algorithm DivFNSI-FS. Finally, data experiments are completed to validate DivFNSI-FS effectiveness with six state -of -the -art multi -label feature selection approaches on fourteen multi -label datasets. A conclusion can be drawn that DivFNSI-FS outperforms existing algorithms to obtain better performance on eight commonly-used evaluation indexes.

AB Due to the unique structure, carbon nanomaterials could convert near -infrared (NIR) light into heat efficiently in tumor ablation using photothermal therapy (PTT). However, none of them has been applied in clinical treatment, because they have not been approved for clinical evaluations and the precise temperature control facility is scarce. In this study, we designed a temperature -responsive controller for PTT and used carbon nanoparticles-Fe (II) complex (CNSI-Fe) as photothermal conversion agent (PTA) for PTT of tumor in vitro and in vivo. CNSI-Fe was an innovative drug under the evaluations in clinical trials. CNSI-Fe showed excellent photothermal conversion ability in water to increase the water temperature by 40 degrees C within 5 min under irradiation of 808 nm laser at 0.5 W/cm 2 . The temperature was precisely controlled at 52 degrees C for both in vitro and in vivo tumor inhibition. CNSI-Fe with NIR irradiation showed higher tumor cell inhibition than CNSI. In tumor bearing mice, CNSI-Fe with NIR irradiation achieved an inhibition rate of 84.7 % and 71.4 % of them were completely cured. Mechanistically, CNSI-Fe under NIR irradiation induced the radical generation, oxidative damage and ferroptosis to kill tumor. In addition, CNSI-Fe showed good biosafety during PTT according to hematological, serum biological and histopathological examinations. These results indicated that the combination of chemotherapy and PTT provided higher antitumor efficiency using CNSI-Fe as PTA.

AB The biodegradation of antibiotics in aquatic environment is consistently impeded by the widespread presence of heavy metals, necessitating urgent measures to mitigate or eliminate this environmental stress. This work investigated the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by the white -rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (WRF) under heavy metal cadmium ion (Cd 2+ ) stress, with a focus on the protective effects of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The pseudo -first -order rate constant and removal efficiency of 5 mg/L SMX in 48 h by WRF decrease from 0.208 h -1 and 55.6% to 0.08 h -1 and 28.6% at 16 mg/L of Cd 2+ , while these values recover to 0.297 h -1 and 72.8% by supplementing RGO. The results demonstrate that RGO, possessing excellent biocompatibility, effectively safeguard the mycelial structure of WRF against Cd 2+ stress and provide protection against oxidative damage to WRF. Simultaneously, the production of manganese peroxidase (MnP) by WRF decreases to 38.285 U/L in the presence of 24 mg/L Cd 2+ , whereas it recovers to 328.51 U/L upon the supplement of RGO. RGO can induce oxidative stress in WRF, thereby stimulating the secretion of laccase (Lac) and MnP to enhance the SMX degradation. The mechanism discovered in this study provides a new strategy to mitigate heavy metal stress encountered by WRF during antibiotic degradation.

AB An ideal electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material possessing lightweight, high EMI shielding efficiency (EMI SE > 60 dB), low reflectivity (R < 0.5 or SER < 3 dB), and excellent stretchability (strain >200%) with a stable EMI SE is remarkably desirable but challenging to design for avoiding electromagnetic pollution caused by the rapid development of electronic devices. Here, an elastomeric foam (SDEP/LM) with a slidable double-network structure covered with a thin layer of liquid metal is developed, achieving a porosity of 67% and a low density of 1.1 +/- 0.1 g/cm(3), a fracture strain of 1400%, a super high tearing energy of 31.6 kJ/m(2), and a high absorption-dominated EMI shielding performance (SE of 66 dB with a thickness of 2 mm). The absorption efficiency (A(eff)) for all samples exceeded 99.99%. This unique absorption-dominated EMI shielding ability is completely different from the reflection-dominated EMI shielding behavior of conventional liquid-metal-based materials and is attributed to the porous structure and elasticity of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, the EMI shielding performance is stable when stretched.

AB Straw retention has been widely implemented to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and green-house gas (GHG) mitigation for global agriculture. However, the combined effects of long-term straw retention on crop production, SOC sequestration and GHG emissions response to climate change remain unknown. Two nearby wheat-maize rotation field experiments in the North China Plain, combined with local weather, soil and agronomic measurements, were used to evaluate the applicability of the SPACSYS model. The model was then applied to assess the response of crop yield, SOC storage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to three nitrogen fertilizer application levels (100, 200, 400 kg N ha(-1)) and three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) under straw retention for the wheat-maize rotation systems during 2021-2100. In general, the model was reasonably accurate with R-2 and model efficiency (EF) ranging from 0.25 to 0.96 and 0.32-0.94, respectively. Climate change decreased wheat yield by 4-39%, while maize showed a slight increase (3%) under RCP2.6 and a decrease of 1-15% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The SOC storage in the 0-20 cm soil increased at a rate of 73-195 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) but decreased within the upper 1 m soil at 280-390 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Climate change reduced the positive effect of SOC sequestration except in RCP2.6 and stimulated substantial N2O emissions ranging from 1-7.5 to 2.9-23.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), consequently, the global warming potential increased from -79-2555 to 548-9357 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) under various N fertilizer application levels. This study reveals that the negative feedback under climate change with modelling approach, and extensive efforts are needed to make adaptations to ensure food production and reduce GHG emissions in the future.

AB Plant litter decomposition is critical for carbon and nutrient cycling globally. However, the effect of large herbivore grazing on litter decomposition and its mechanisms remain less explored. Here, 1203 paired observations and 381 independent experiments were analyzed to determine how litter decomposition and nutrient cycling respond to changes in grazing intensity. Grazing significantly increased litter decomposition rate by 14.08 % and litter carbon release by 5.03 %, and this effect was observed in grasslands and croplands but not in forests. The positive grazing effect was also found under sheep and cattle/yak grazing. Moderate grazing advanced the homefield advantage effect but inhibited under heavy grazing for grazed litters. The grazing effect was larger for high quality litter than for low quality litter. Litter decomposition slowed under >10 years heavy grazing but accelerated under moderate grazing. The effects of large herbivore grazing on litter decomposition were jointly influenced by grazing intensity, livestock type, climate condition, decomposition duration, litter quality, and soil properties. Our results demonstrated that large herbivore grazing accelerates litter decomposition globally and emphasized the significance and importance of grazing intensity on litter decomposition, which should be integrated into terrestrial ecosystem models.

AB Thermoviscosifying polymers refer to a category of smart materials that exhibit a responsive behavior to environmental stimuli, specifically demonstrating a natural rise in viscosity of solutions as the temperature increases. The temperature -dependent behavior exhibited by thermally viscous polymers renders them potentially advantageous in the context of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). There exists a dearth of research pertaining to the application of thermoviscosifying polymer for better recovery in reservoirs characterized by high temperatures and high salt content. In order to tackle the mentioned concerns, this study examined the utilization of welan gum modified with poly(2-oxazoline) as thermally responsive chain segments to enhance viscosity. The objective was to evaluate the ability to enhance viscosity under thermal conditions and to assess their effectiveness in displacement of reservoir oil in high temperature and high salt environments. This study aimed to establish a theoretical framework for understanding the correlation between the molecular structure and performance of novel thermally viscous polymers. Additionally, it sought to offer practical insights into designing the molecular structure of thermally viscous polymers suitable for polymer flooding in high temperature and high salt environments. Furthermore, the study proposed the application of these new thermoviscosifying polymers for EOR.

AB This study aimed to explore whether empathy with nature (i.e., the tendency to understand and share the emotional experience of the natural world) contributes to pro-environmental attitudes in early childhood. In a correlational investigation (Study 1), 138 (Mage = 57.78 months) preschool children completed a battery of tasks to measure their pro-environmental attitudes, empathy with nature, and empathy with humans. We found that empathy with nature positively predicts pro-environmental attitudes, even beyond the predictive power of empathy with humans. In a quasi-experimental investigation (Study 2), 46 children from two parallel classes in the same preschool were recruited as the intervention (n = 23, Mage = 66.74 months) and control (n = 23, Mage = 67.61 months) groups. An intervention session that aimed to induce empathy with nature was applied to the intervention group, whereas an active control teaching session was applied to the control group. After the intervention, the intervention group demonstrated greater pro-environmental attitudes than did the control group. Together, our studies provide converging evidence that empathy with nature promotes pro-environmental attitudes in early childhood, further implying the value of integrating empathy with nature in early childhood environmental education.

AB The spatial layout of traditional residential houses is closely related to national and regional characteristics and culture. The traditional village of Yi nationality is selected, and the organization structure of the outside village and the inside living space is studied through the graphical and quantitative analysis method of space syntax. The primary purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial characteristics of Yi dwellings and infer the cultural factors behind them. To explore how to integrate traditional spatial characteristics into contemporary design and promote the preservation and inheritance of architectural culture. The results show that 1) the outer village space of residential houses is characterized by weak identifiability, compact and loose organizational structure, weak permeability, and weak accessibility; 2) The interior space of dwellings presents a spatial layout with the main room and courtyard as the core as a whole. The interior space of dwellings is abundant and flexible, and the accessibility of ancillary functional space is weak. 3) The cultural causes of the formation of these spatial features include complex landforms, family systems, hierarchical systems, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral production modes, the concept of valuing family harmony, the use of regional materials, respect for nature, fire worship, etc. 4) The spatial characteristics of traditional dwellings are inherited in contemporary dwellings. Fuzzy elements can be added in villages according to family relations, and characteristic Spaces such as courtyards and fire ponds in traditional dwellings can be preserved.

AB The mechanism of selenium in the UV photochemical vapor generation (PVG) process was investigated by the use of multiple analytical methods. It was found that the UV-induced photooxidation trapping of the generated volatile SeH2 should be responsible for the previous opinion of relative inertness of Se(VI) in PVG with formic acid. Furthermore, the formation of Se(IV) was found during the PVG process, and the comproportionation of Se(IV) with SeH2 and the photooxidation of Se(IV) into Se(VI) were investigated. Then, a preliminary model was proposed for the PVG process of Se(VI) and Se(IV) with low-molecular-weight organic acids. Then, a novel, simple, and green photocontrolled method without any photocatalyst was thus proposed for the nonchromatographic speciation analysis of Se(IV) and Se(VI), with a limit of detection of 0.2 and 5 ng/mL, respectively.

AB ObjectiveThis study explored how belief in a just world (BJW) develops among Chinese adolescents and the predictive role of family factors.BackgroundThe development of BJW in adolescence is an important but understudied topic, especially in non-Western contexts.MethodUsing a three-wave longitudinal design, 1525 participants (48% girls; Mage = 12.47) were recruited to report their BJW, childhood SES, only-child or not, and parental psychological control in Wave 1 (Wave 2: N = 1262; Wave 3: N = 1124).ResultsThe mean slope for personal BJW is positive and significant, but not significant for general BJW. Childhood SES predicted initial level of personal and general BJW and the rate of growth of personal BJW. Only-child predicted initial level and the growth rate of personal BJW. Parental psychological control negatively predicted personal and general BJW at three time points.ConclusionPersonal BJW increased during the observation period, whereas general BJW was stable. Individuals with lower levels of childhood SES had lower initial personal and general BJW but a higher growth rate in personal BJW than those with higher SES. Individuals having siblings had lower levels of initial personal BJW but a higher growth rate in personal BJW than those from only-child family. Parental psychological control may exert consistent and contemporaneous negative effect on BJW across time.

AB Despite evidence indicating a connection between inappropriate parenting styles and peer victimization, the dynamic processes and mechanisms underlying this link and whether it is consistent across genders and different developmental stages have yet to be explored. To address these gaps, the current 2-year longitudinal study explored the potential bidirectional associations between parental psychological control and peer victimization, as well as the mediating role of adolescent basic psychological need satisfaction. A total of 4,990 adolescents (49.4% boys, Mage T1 = 12.21 years, SDage T1 = 2.60) across different developmental stages (early adolescents, N = 1,819, 49.2% boys, Mage T1 = 9.34 years, SDage T1 = 0.62; middle adolescents, N = 1,525, 50.75% boys, Mage T1 = 12.47 years, SDage T1 = 0.69; late adolescents, N = 1,646, 46.5% boys, Mage T1 = 15.26 years, SDage T1 = 0.50) participated in this three-wave longitudinal survey. The results revealed that parental psychological control was bidirectionally associated with peer victimization. Additionally, basic psychological need satisfaction played the meditating role in this vicious cycle. Further analysis demonstrated interesting developmental differences. Parental psychological control was directly associated with subsequent peer victimization at all three developmental stages, and peer victimization was only directly associated with subsequent parental psychological control in the next year among early adolescents and middle adolescents. The mutual mediating role of basic psychological need satisfaction between parental psychological control and peer victimization was observed exclusively in early adolescents. Both male and female adolescents could be equally affected by these dynamics. This research underscores the reciprocal dynamics inherent in parent-child interactions, intervening in either of these processes (i.e., family, peers, and adolescent basic psychological need satisfaction) may break this destructive cycle.

AB Public supervision, as a source of social behavioral norms and moral guidelines, exerts important guidance and influence on individuals. To maintain public order, in this study, we propose a reputation incentives mechanism with public supervision, in which each player is granted the authority to evaluate others. These players, by observing, can make positive or negative evaluations that derive from the satisfaction level of the interactive behavior to neighbors choosing cooperation or defection in each round of the evolutionary game. Evaluations made by defectors are considered untrustworthy, resulting in the evaluation values assigned to others being halved. After mutual evaluation, the reputation is an average of the evaluations given by all their neighbors and then is consequently granted to each player. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate that reputation provides rewards that positively incentivize cooperation. And we observe that a weaker evaluation intensity leads to more stable and higher levels of cooperation among individuals. This mechanism provides valuable insights into the evolution of reputation and the optimization of supervising mechanisms.

AB Liver fibrosis (LF) is a late-stage process observed in various chronic liver diseases with bile and retinol metabolism closely associated with it. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) have shown significant therapeutic potential in treating LF. In this study, the transplantation of ADMSCs was applied to a CCl4-induced LF model to investigate its molecular mechanism through a multi-omics joint analysis. The findings reveal that ADMSCs effectively reduced levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), thereby mitigating liver lesions, preventing liver parenchymal necrosis, and improving liver collagen deposition. Furthermore, 4751 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 270 differentially expressed metabolites (DMs) were detected via transcriptome and metabolomics analysis. Conjoint analysis showed that ADMSCs up-regulated the expression of Cyp7a1, Baat, Cyp27a1, Adh7, Slco1a4, Aldh1a1, and Adh7 genes to promote primary bile acids (TCDCA: Taurochenodeoxycholic acid; GCDCA: Glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GCA: glycocholic acid, TCA: Taurocholic acid) synthesis, secretion and retinol metabolism. This suggests that ADMSCs play a therapeutic role in maintaining bile acid (BA) homeostasis and correcting disturbances in retinol metabolism.

AB The shape coefficient of building (SCB) is a measure of correlating a building's shape and its energy consumption. However, strictly adhering to restrictions the SCB may not be conducive to reducing energy consumption, as it disregards the potential benefits of solar radiation. To address this, a novel concept and method for determining the modified shape coefficient of building (MSCB) have been introduced in considerations of heat loss and solar heat gain. Field measurements were conducted in western Sichuan to establish a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing indoor thermal environments, involving collecting indoor air temperature data for model buildings under natural and heating conditions, including solar radiation, building orientations, and Uvalues. Results demonstrated that maintaining an identical SCB did not consistently ensure similar indoor thermal environments. The indoor thermal environments were significantly influenced by building orientations, U-values, and solar radiation, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on SCB. A simulation method validated through experiments was utilized to predict the dynamic heating load of an actual building. The influence of building orientations on the MSCB across different time scales and actual climatic conditions was investigated. Results illustrated a potential reduction of the SCB by up to 32.4% in the specific case. This reduction correlated with trends observed in the monthly correction factors and heat consumption, suggesting that moderate relaxation of SCB restrictions could be viable even in scenarios with high heating demands. This research contributes valuable insights into the realm of energy-efficient building design.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have established themselves as pivotal allies in the realm of plant physiology, renowned for their remarkable contributions to augmenting both growth and resilience against environmental stresses. In this study, we embarked on a comprehensive investigation into the discernible impact of two distinct AMF species on a widely planted oat cultivar, 'Qingyan No. 1', when subjected to the austere conditions of a drought. The experimental design included three distinct AMF treatments (inoculation with Rhiaophagus intraradices, Funneliformis mosseae, or not), and the three water treatments were 75% of field capacity (well watered), 50% of field capacity (moderate drought), and 30% of field capacity (severe drought). The obtained results showed that the rate of inoculation under 75% FC for both AMF species was over 74%. Drought stress limited the growth and osmotic regulation of the oat plants. However, AMF inoculation observably increased the above-ground biomass under 75% FC and increased the root biomass under 30% FC. AMF inoculation also increased the root traits under 75% FC and 50% FC. R. intraradices inoculation increased the above-ground soluble sugar and soluble protein concentrations, and both AMF species showed decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in the roots. Furthermore, the pervasive influence of drought stress exerted a discernible stranglehold on nutrient uptake in the oat plants, profoundly impacting the distribution of nutrients within the shoots and roots. Regardless of the drought stress treatment, the inoculation with both AMF species increased the P concentrations in the roots and the K and Mg concentrations in the roots, and the inoculation with R. intraradices increased the Ca concentration in the whole oat plant. Under 75% FC, the N concentration of the whole oat plant was significantly reduced by both AMF species. However, under 50% FC and 30% FC, the N concentrations in the shoots inoculated with both AMF species were close to that of the non-inoculated shoots. In summary, AMF improved the osmotic regulation and nutrient absorption and distribution of oat plants under drought stress and thus promoted the growth and biomass accumulation of oat plants.

AB Combining proteins with polysaccharides or polysaccharide-rich fruits to improve print performance had become a hot research topic. This study aims to develop a new 3D-printed food construct based on mango. The rheo-logical properties analysis of pea protein isolate (PPI)-mango mixtures was carried out, and the 3D printing process was simulated by their behavior during the extrusion process (depending on viscosity) and after printing (depending on storage modulus G & PRIME;, structural recovery, and tacky adhesion). The texture and nutritional char-acteristics were also determined. The results showed that the addition of PPI improved the rheological properties and texture characteristics of the mango pulp. This made them show a gel-like structure and more suitable for 3D printing. Besides, the mixture with 60/100 g PPI had the best 3D printing structure at 0.84 mm nozzle diameter and 35 mm/s printing speed, matching the target geometry and having a fine resolution, a smoother surface texture, and fewer point defects without compression deformation. Moreover, the mixture with 60/100 g PPI had the highest overall acceptability score in the sensory evaluation experiment, which was significantly higher than other samples (p < 0.05). The results indicated that adding PPI at the optimal concentration enhanced the interaction between protein and polysaccharide, resulting in a more robust and stable gel network. Therefore, the mango and PPI mixture was a promising material for 3D food printing.

AB DNAzyme machines play critical roles in the fields of cell imaging, disease diagnosis, and cancer therapy. However, the applications of DNAzyme machines are limited by the nucleases-induced degradation, non-specific binding of proteins, and insufficient provision of cofactors. Herein, protected DNAzyme machines with different cofactor designs (referred to as ProDs) were nanoengineered by the construction of multifunctional metal-phenolic nanoshells to deactivate the interferential proteins, including nucleases and non-specific binding proteins. Moreover, the nanoshells not only facilitate the cellular internalization of ProDs but provide specific metal ions acting as cofactors of the designed DNAzymes. Cellular imaging results demonstrated that ProDs could effectively and simultaneously monitor multiple tumor-related microRNAs in living cells. This facile and rapid strategy that encapsulates DNAzyme machines into the protective metal-phenolic nanoshells is anticipated to extend to a wide range of functional nucleic acidsbased biomedical applications. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Spatholobi caulis (SC), the dried vine stem of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, is known as Ji Xue Teng in China, and has long been used as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to treat anaemia, menstrual abnormalities, rheumatoid arthritis, purpura, etc.Aim of the review: The aim of this review is to provide a systematic and updated summary of the traditional uses, chemical constituents, biological activities and clinical applications of SC. In addition, several suggestions for future research on SC are also proposed.Materials and methods: Extensive information and data on SC were obtained from electronic databases (ScienceDirect, Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, SpringerLink and Wiley Online). Additional information was collected from Ph.D. and MSc dissertations, published books, and classic material medica.Results: To date, phytochemical studies have revealed that approximately 243 chemical ingredients have been isolated from SC and identified, including flavonoids, glycosides, phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids, volatile oils, sesquiterpenoids and other compounds. Many studies have indicated that extracts and pure constituents from SC possess a wide spectrum of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological effects, such as anti-tumour, haematopoietic, antiinflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral and antibacterial effects, as well as other activities. SC could be applied to the treatment of leukopenia, aplastic anemic, endometriosis, etc. according to the clinical reports. The traditional efficacies of SC is due to the biological functions of its chemical compounds, especially flavonoids. However, research investigating the toxicological effects of SC is relatively limited.Conclusions: SC is widely used in TCM formulae and its some traditional efficacies has been confirmed by extensive recent pharmacological and clinical studies. Most the biological activities of the SC may be attributed to flavonoids. However, in-depth studies on the molecular mechanisms of the effective ingredients and extracts of SC are limited. Further systematic studies focusing on pharmacokinetics, toxicology and quality control are needed to ensure the effective and safe application of SC.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Commiphora mukul (Hook. ex Stocks) Engl. (also known as Guggulu) is one of the oldest and most prominent herb used in Ayurvedic medicine. Commiphora mukul plants have traditionally been used to treat inflammation, diabetes, rheumatism, arthritis, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. It has long been used in China, India, Greece, and other countries. Commiphora mukul is an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the United States and Western countries. Commiphora mukul has excellent medicinal and commercial value and deserves further investigation.Aim of the study: This paper systematically reviews the historical records, application rules, phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, clinical research, and adverse reactions of C. mukul and provides a reference for its comprehensive application in basic research, new drug development, and clinical treatment.Materials and methods: Literature were collected from databases such as PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, TBRC, and other sources such as ancient books on traditional medicine, classic books on herbal medicine, and modern monographs. In this study, the application history and modern pharmacological research on C. mukul in the medicine of all ethnic groups were comprehensively and systematically reviewed.Results: According to the vast literature, the varieties, morphological characteristics, distribution, and description of C. mukul used in Unani medicine, Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine, Mongolian medicine, and Uygur medicine are highly consistent. Commiphora mukul is mainly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, obesity, hemorrhoids, urinary system diseases, skin diseases, inflammation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tumors, and other diseases. The core medicinal material combination in different ethnic medical preparations was C. mukul-Terminalia chebula Retz. (101 times), C. mukul-Moschus (55 times), C. mukul-Auck-landia lappa (Decne.) Decne. (52 times), and C. mukul-Acorus calamus L (27 times). Phytochemical studies confirmed that 150 components with different structures had been isolated and identified. Z-and E-guggulsterone are the main isomers in C. mukul. C. mukul has anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, bone resorption, nervous system protection, myocardial protection, antibacterial, and other pharmacological prop-erties. Clinical studies have only identified the role of C. mukul in treating hemorrhoids and lowering blood lipids.Conclusions: As an essential traditional medicine, C. mukul is widely used in the national traditional medicine system, and rich in chemical constituents and exhibit pharmacological activities. This study found that current research on C. mukul mainly focuses on its chemical composition and pharmacological properties. However, scientific research on the quality control of medicinal materials, identification of original plants, pharmacoki-netics, and toxicology are relatively weak, and research in this area needs to be strengthened.

AB Manganese-based composites are considered as valid cathodes for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the gradually dissolute and structural collapse of the Mn species are still restricting the practical application. Herein, an electrochemical activated insoluble Mn3(PO4)2 coating layer is tightly encapsulated on soluble amorphous MnO2 nanosheets (AMO@A-MP/CC). The long-range disordered atomic arrangements of amorphous MnO2 can release the strain due to volume changes, while the abundant structural defects can act as ion storage sites with high reversibility, thus effectively enhance the intrinsic capacity and reduce the capacity degradation. Moreover, the compact and insoluble Mn3(PO4)2 coating layer can inhibit the gradual diffusion of Mn2+ into electrolyte and enhance structural stability of amorphous MnO2. Therefore, AMO@A-MP/CC composite delivers ultra-high specific capacity (420.0 mAh g-1 at 0.3 A g-1), remarkable cyclic stability (97.5 % capacity retention after 1000 cycles) and excellent rate capability (224.2 mAh g-1 at 3.0 A g-1). Significantly, the energy-density of 225.0 Wh kg-1 for single electrode and bendable ability can be achieved in the flexible Zn/AMO@A-MP battery, demonstrating the synergistic effect of amorphous structure and surface coating for future ZIBs development.

AB The self-standing graphene membranes are considered as ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, maintaining highly regularized and uniform graphene membranes with satisfied electrochemical performance is still a challenge. Herein, with the chelation of metal cation and the radial shear force introduced by high-speed spinning, the uniform interlayer channels and shrunken cracks between adjacent nanosheets can be achieved in the metal-intercalated graphene oxide (GO) membranes, thus realizing regularization both in normal and radial direction. With the promotion in electron transfer and electrolyte penetration, the iron cross-linked GO mem-brane with spin coating for 40 cycles exhibits a high specific capacitance (427 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and rate capability (42.6% capacitance retention from 1 to 40 A g-1), as well as excellent cyclic capability (90.5% capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles). Particularly, a 21% increasement in capacitance can be achieved after high-speed spinning treatment. Moreover, the spin regularization strategy can be extended to GO membranes cross-linked by various multi-valence metal cations, the electrochemical performance of metal-cation cross-linked GO membrane electrodes after high-speed spinning treatment can also be improved obviously. Therefore, this paper provides a novel method to fabricate highly ordered GO membranes with promising electrochemical performance, which presents an immense potential application in membrane materials applied in energy storage, separation and catalysis.

AB Metabolic disorders as ketosis are manifestations of the animal's inability to manage the increase in energy requirement during early lactation. Generally, buffaloes show a different response to higher metabolic demands than other ruminants with a lower incidence of metabolic problems, although ketosis is one of the major diseases that may decrease the productivity in buffaloes. The aim of this study was to characterize the metabolic profile of Mediterranean buffaloes (MB) associated with 2 different levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Sixty-two MB within 50 days in milk (DIM) were enrolled and divided into 2 groups according to se -rum BHB concentration: healthy group (37 MB; BHB <0.70 mmol/L; body condition score: 5.00; parity: 3.78; and DIM: 30.70) and group at risk of hyperketonemia (25 MB; BHB >= 0.70 mmol/L; body condition score: 4.50; parity: 3.76; and DIM: 33.20). The statistical analysis was conducted by one-way ANOVA and un-paired 2-sample Wilcoxon tests. Fifty-seven metabolites were identified and among them, 12 were significant or tended to be significant. These metabolites were related to different metabolic changes such as mobilization of body resources, ruminal fermentations, urea cycle, thy-roid hormone synthesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress status. These findings are suggestive of metabolic changes related to subclinical ketosis status that should be further investigated to better characterize this dis-ease in the MB.

AB The stability of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is critical for ecosystem functions and services, and have been studied across a wide range of ecosystems. An intriguing and challenging question emerging from these studies is how precipitation fluctuations, especially extreme precipitation, affect the temporal stability of ANPP in alpine meadow. We investigated the changes in plant community composition and aboveground biomass in an alpine meadow over six consecutive years under five precipitation treatments (increase of 50%, natural precipitation, decreases of 30%, 50% and 90%) in order to reveal the response of ANPP stability to the precipitation change, especially extreme precipitation, and the relevant driving mechanisms. The alpha diversity of plant species did not differ significantly among the treatments. ANPP was resistant to changes in precipitation between 354 and 1336 mm (precipitation interval of 50% decrease in precipitation in the driest year and 50% increase in precipitation in the wettest year during the experiment), suggesting that normal interannual fluctuations in precipitation and recent changes in regional precipitation might not significantly influence ANPP stability. However, extreme precipitation treatment (90% decrease), significantly reduced ANPP, species asynchrony and ANPP stability. A path model indicated that ANPP stability was directly affected by population stability, species asynchrony and grass stability. While the effect of species diversity on ANPP stability depends on the extents to which it positively affects species asynchrony and negatively affects population stability. In addition, the dominant species stability did not directly affect ANPP stability, while indirectly affected ANPP stability by changing the asynchrony of species.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are rapidly developed materials with fantastic properties and wide applica-tions. The increasing studies highlighted the potential threats of MOF materials to the environment. Comparing to the limited species of metal elements, the organic ligands have much higher diversity, but the influence of organic ligands on the environmental impacts of MOFs has not been revealed. Herein, we synthesized three Cu-MOFs with different organic ligands, namely Cu-BDC (1,4-terephthalic acid), Cu-IM (imidazole) and Cu-TATB (2,4,6-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine), and evaluated their environmental toxicity to the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. Cu-BDC inhibited the bacterial growth at lower concentrations than Cu-IM and Cu-TATB. The transcriptomes suggested the changes of membrane components by Cu-MOFs, consistent with the membrane leakage and cell wall damages. Cu-MOFs inhibited the nitrogen fixation activity through energy metabolism disturbance according to Gene Ontology functional annotation of ATP binding, Ca2+Mg2+- ATPase activity and ATP content. Only Cu-IM lowered the nitrogen fixation related nif genes, and affected the ribosome, purine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Otherwise, Cu-BDC and Cu-TATB mainly affected the flagellar assemblies and bacterial chemotaxis pathways. Our results collectively indicated that organic ligands regulated the environmental toxicity of MOFs through different metabolism pathways.

AB The integration of Tibetan Thangka and other ethnic painting styles is an important topic of Chinese ethnic art. Its purpose is to explore, supplement, and continue Chinese traditional culture. Restricted by Buddhism and the economy, the traditional Thangka presents the problem of a single style, and drawing a Thangka is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In response to these problems, we propose a Tibetan painting style fusion (TPSF) model based on neural networks that can automatically and quickly integrate the painting styles of the two ethnicities. First, we set up Thangka and Chinese painting datasets as experimental data. Second, we use the training data to train the generator and the discriminator. Then, the TPSF model maps the style of the input image to the target image to fuse the two ethnicities painting styles of Tibetan and Chinese. Finally, to demonstrate the advancement of the proposed method, we add four comparison models to our experiments. At the same time, the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric and the questionnaire method were used to evaluate the quality and visual appeal of the generated images, respectively. The experimental results show that the fusion images have excellent quality and great visual appeal.

AB In oat production, the over-application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in fields due to low N fertilizer use efficiency not only increases production costs but also causes environmental pollution. Currently, mining low N-tolerant oat varieties is an important way to promote sustainable agriculture. In this study, 30 oat varieties were grown in a seedling culture with two treatments of normal N (10 mM NH4NO3) and low N (1.25 mM NH4NO3), and the correlations between agronomic traits and plant N content and low N tolerance coefficients and indices were determined, which can be used as indicators for the evaluation of low N-tolerant oat varieties. Coefficient of variation, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, partial least-squares discrimination analysis, random forest analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and model evaluation, and membership function analysis were used for in-depth analysis of these indicators. Plant N content, root-crown ratio, and dry weight of aboveground plant parts were found to be important indicators of low N tolerance in oats. According to the membership function ranking of the 30 selected oat varieties, Jiayan 2, Qingyongjiu 035, and Qingyin 2 had strong tolerance to low N stress and Qingyongjiu 003, Qingyongjiu 021, and Qingyongjiu 016 had poor tolerance to low N stress. Thus, this study provides a reliable and comprehensive method for evaluating the low N tolerance of oat varieties as well as a reference for screening other low N-tolerant plants.

AB Dynamic manipulation of enzymatic activity is a challenging task for applications in chemical and phar-maceutical industries due to the difficult modification and variable conformation of various enzymes. Here, we report a new strategy for reversible dynamic modulation of enzymatic activity by near-infrared light-induced photothermal conversion based on polyphenol-functionalized liquid metal nanodroplets (LM). The metal-phenolic nanocoating not only provides colloidal stability of LM nanodroplets but also generates nanointerfaces for the assembly of various enzymes on the LM nanodroplets. Upon near in-frared (NIR) irradiation, the localized microenvironmental heating through photothermal effect of the LM nanodroplets allows tailoring the enzymatic activity without affecting the bulk temperature. A library of functional enzymes, including proteinase K, glucoamylase, glucose oxidase, and Bst DNA polymerase, is integrated to perform a reversible control and enhanced activities even after five times of cycles, demon-strating great potential in bacterial fermentation, bacteriostasis, and target gene amplification.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

AB In consideration of growing human health and ecological environment issues, lead-free piezoelectric ceramics have aroused heated research to develop their potential applications in electronic fields instead of toxic lead -based ones. In the present work, a ternary lead-free material system of (0.97-x) K0.48Na0.52Nb0.96Sb0.04O3-0.03Bi0.5Na0.5Zr0.8Sn0.2O3-xBiFeO3 (KNNS-BNZS-xBF, 0 <= x <= 0.007) ceramics was designed, and the evolution mechanisms of microstructures and electrical behaviors at multiple applied fields were revealed in detail. The bimodal microstructure with an alternative fine and coarse grain size distribution feature is generally observed, while the BF doping tends to decrease grain size and increase the diffusion phase transition behaviors. As x = 0.005, the R-O-T multiphase boundary is formed at room temperature, accompanied by the presence of striped nanodomains with smaller size and regular distribution feature that exhibit the better polarization switching and the fast domain wall movement under external stimuli. In particular, an enhanced d33 -470 pC/N and a simultaneous higher Tc -260 degrees C are achieved in KNNS-BNZS-0.005BF, reflecting a better balanced development of performance by the present doping strategy. Most importantly, benefiting from the coexistence of R-O-T multiphase boundary and the lower domain wall energy, an excellent d33* -530 pm/V is attained as well in this ceramic, which favors the better applications in high precision displacement or strain actuators. This work sheds insight into understanding the underlying physical mechanism of enhanced perfor-mance of KNN-based ceramics, substantially expanding the more applications of lead-free piezoelectric materials in electronic fields.

AB Shrub encroachment and conversion of grazing land to forage cultivation are the main disturbance factors at alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Yet our understanding of soil bacterial communities impacts of these disturbances is limited. Using shrub (Potentilla fruticose) encroachment systems and forage lands (Medicago sativa lands, and Elymus sibiricus lands) as a model, we investigated the effects of shrub encroachment and land use on bacterial communities in alpine grass soil at the Eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau of China. Soil bacterial communities were examined using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V4-V5 region, Illumina MiSeq). Soil properties of TN and SOC were tested using an Elementar Variomax CNS Analyser (Elementar Corp., Germany). WEOC concentrations were determined following Ma's procedures, to answer the following hypotheses: i) shrub encroachment and forage cultivation would reduce soil organic carbon content, ii) the bacterial communities in shrub encroachment and forage lands are less diverse than those of alpine grassland, and iii) the occurrence of extensive mutualism or commensalism in alpine grassland, and competition or mutual exclusion in shrub encroachment and forage land. In this study, we found that SOC and TN decreased on shrub encroached and forage lands, supporting our first hypothesis. In total, 56 bacterial phyla were identified across the sampling sites. The dominant phyla at the four plots, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi, accounted for 27-28%, 13-30%, 13-26%, 4-8% and 4-9% of the total population, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, alpha-diversities (phylogenetic diversity, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) richness, Shannon, and Chao1) were consistently higher in disturbed soils than in alpine grassland, and the highest appeared in Medicago sativa lands compared to other sites. Soil texture and soil organic carbon together explained 30% of the total variations of bacterial communities, indicating that bacterial habitat (e.g. soil texture) and substrate (soil organic carbon) were affected in shrub encroachment and forage lands. Copiotrophs (Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria) and Nitrospirae were enriched in alpine grassland, while oligotrophs (Acidobacteria) were concentrated in shrub encroached and forage lands, indicating that shrub encroachment and conversion of alpine grassland to forage land may alter bacterial life history strategies. Through the phylogenetic molecular ecological network approach, we found that the bacterial network of alpine grassland was more complex than that of shrub and forage lands. Furthermore, the bacterial network of alpine grassland was more modular, and the taxa tended to co-occur, with positive associations accounting for 95% of all potential interactions. By contrast, negative interactions appeared more in shrub encroached (34%) and forage land (33%) compared to alpine grassland. This indicated that bacterial species have greater niche-sharing and more collaboration in alpine grassland than in shrub and forage lands. In conclusion, our findings revealed that shrub encroachment and conversion of alpine grassland to forage increased competition of bacterial species for substrates, with potential for serious consequences such as elevating losses of soil carbon.

AB Clustering algorithms play a very important role in the field of data mining and machine learning. However existing clustering methods are sensitive to parameters and outliers. The commonly used clustering methods are restricted by problem of parameter selection that different algorithms need to input one or more different parameters. For overcoming these drawbacks, we propose a non-parameter clustering algorithm based on saturated neighborhood graph known as NPCSNG. NPCSNG algorithm uses mathematic method to preprocess the data set, and then uses the characteristics of SNG adaptive clustering to cluster the data, so as to achieve the purpose of non-parameter clustering. NPCSNG has three main advantages: (1) it does not need to manually set any parameters due to the use of adaptive saturated neighborhood graph; (2) it significantly improves the clustering performance as well as the model robustness, making NPCSNG a more practical approach for real-world scenarios; (3) it can easily adapt to data-sets with complex manifold structure. NPCSNG algorithm solves the problem of parameter selection of clustering algorithm and it broadens the idea of clustering by using the characteristics of graphs. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The methylation status of histones plays a crucial role in many cellular processes, including follicular and oocyte development. Lysine-specific demethylase 2a (KDM2a) has been reported to be closely associated with gametogenesis and reproductive performance, but the specific function and regulatory mechanism have been poorly characterized in vivo. We found KDM2a to be highly expressed in growing follicles and oocytes of mice in this study. To elucidate the physiological role of Kdm2a, the zona pellucida 3-Cre (Zp3-Cre)/LoxP system was used to generate an oocyte Kdm2a conditional knockout (Zp3-Cre; Kdm2a(flox/flox), termed Kdm2a cKO) model. Our results showed that the number of pups was reduced by approximately 50% in adult Kdm2a cKO female mice mating with wildtype males than that of the control (Kdm2a(flox/flox)) group. To analyze the potential causes, the ovaries of Kdm2a cKO mice were subjected to histological examination, and results indicated an obvious difference in follicular development between Kdm2a cKO and control female mice and partial arrest at the primary antral follicle stage. The GVBD and matured rates of oocytes were also compromised after conditional knockout Kdm2a, and the morphological abnormal oocytes increased. Furthermore, the level of 17 beta-estradiol of Kdm2a cKO mice was only 60% of that in the counterparts, and hormone sensitivity decreased as the total number of ovulated and matured oocytes decreased after superovulation. After deletion of Kdm2a, the patterns of H3K36me2/3 in GVBD-stage oocytes were remarkedly changed. Transcriptome sequencing showed that the mRNA expression profiles in Kdm2a cKO oocytes were significantly different, and numerous differentially expressed genes were involved in pathways regulating follicular and oocyte development. Taken together, these results indicated that the oocyte-specific knockout Kdm2a gene led to female subfertility, suggesting the crucial role of Kdm2a in epigenetic modification and follicular and oocyte development.

AB Skeletal muscle, comprising approximately 40% of body mass, is a highly complex and heterogeneous tissue serving a multitude of functions in the organism. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are known to participate in skeletal muscle development as critical regulators. However, the regulatory mechanisms of ncRNAs on chicken muscle traits are not well understood. In the present study, we collected the leg muscle from male embryos of Tibetan chicken at embryonic (E) 10 and E18 for RNA sequencing. A total of 6,583 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) including 3,055 down-regulated and 3,528 up-regulated were identified in E18. We identified 695 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) (187 down-regulated and 508 up-regulated) and 1,906 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) (1,224 down-regulated and 682 up-regulated) in E18. Among the 130 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs), 59 were up-regulated and 71 were down-regulated in E18. Numerous DEMs and target genes for miRNAs/lncRNAs were significantly enriched in the muscle system process and cell cycle. We constructed a miRNA-gene-pathway network by considering target relationships between genes related to skeletal muscle development and miRNAs. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was also constructed by integrating competing relationships between DEMs, DELs, and DECs. Several DELs and DECs were predicted to regulate the ADRA1B, ATP2A2, ATP2B1, CACNA1S, CACNB4, MYLK2, and ROCK2 genes. We discovered the crosstalk between the ncRNAs and their competing mRNAs, which provides insights into ceRNA function and mechanisms in the skeletal muscle development of chicken.

AB Although resting-state fMRI studies support that human brain is topographically organized regarding localized and distributed processes, it is still unclear about the task-modulated cortical hierarchy in terms of distributed functional connectivity and localized timescales. To address, current study investigated the effect of cognitive load on cortical connectivity gradients and local timescales in the healthy brain using resting state fMRI as well as 1- and 2-back working memory task fMRI. The results demonstrated that (1) increased cognitive load was associated with lower principal gradient in transmodal cortices, higher principal gradient in primary cortices, decreased decay rate and reduced timescale variability; (2) global properties including gradient variability, timescale decay rate, timescale variability and network topology were all modulated by cognitive load, with timescale variability related to behavioral performance; and (3) at 2-back state, the timescale variability was indirectly and negatively linked with global network integration, which was mediated by gradient variability. In conclusion, current study provides novel evidence for load-modulated cortical connectivity gradients and local timescales during cognitive states, which could contribute to better understanding about cognitive load theory and brain disorders with cognitive dysfunction.

AB Herein, a method was established for the speciation of six selenium species by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS/MS). The factors affecting separation were carefully investigated, including ionic strength, pH, and methanol content. Six species of selenium could be completely separated within 20 min, under the mobile phase of 25 mM citric acid in pH = 4.0 containing 2% methanol. The detection limits of selenite (Se(IV)), selenate (Se(VI)), selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocystine (SeCys(2)), methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), and selenoethionine (SeEt) were 0.04, 0.02, 0.05, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.15 ng mL(-1), respectively. To verify the practicality of this method, the analysis of selenium-enriched foods such as selenium-enriched spring water, selenium-enriched salts, and selenium-enriched tea were conducted, and recovery of 93.7-105% was achieved with RSD < 5%, revealing the high practical utility of the proposed method.

AB The development of (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN)-based lead-free materials with excellent piezoelectric properties has become an vital aspects in recent years, based on the environmental friendliness and potential for device. As the typical electromechanical property, the electrostrictive effect is tightly linked to piezoelectric response, which is dominating the market of high-precision actuators. However, the electrostriction behaviors of KNN-based piezoelectric materials have been little studied as yet, evoking the exploration for the electrostrictive effect potential urgently. Here, a typical KNN-based piezoelectric material of (1-x)K0.5Na0.5NbO3-xBi0.5Na0.5ZrO3 (KNN-xBNZ, x = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11) has been concentrated on the enhanced relaxor characteristic due to destroyed ferroelectric long-range orders via introducing high content of BNZ, aiming to strengthen the electrostriction. A giant electrostrictive coefficient (Q(33) similar to 0.067 m(4)/C-2) is achieved in KNN-0.1BNZ materials, nearly three times higher than that of reported Pb(Zr, Ti)O-3-based materials, and comparable to some typical BaTiO3-based ma-terials. The optimization of Q(33) roots in the co-doped appropriate of Bi3+ and Zr4+ at A or B site, which induces the heterogeneous structure and then limits the range of movement for ions on B site. Significantly, a pretty frequency stability of the remarkable Q(33) (>0.054 m(4)/C-2 under the frequency of 1-100 Hz) is revealed, benefiting to application for some commercial fuel injectors' actuators. This research provides a high-performance electrostrictive material, promoting the research of eco-friendly piezoelectric materials.

AB An efficient potassium persulfate-mediated radical addition of allenamides with diselenides was developed to create a workable route to 1,2-diselenide products. The reaction tolerates a wide spectrum of functional groups to deliver the products in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic investigations including a calculation study indicated that the radical cascade proceeds through a vinyl radical intermediate, which is formed via a selenium radical added to the terminal C = C double bond of allenamides.

However, it is an unavoidable technical problem of the significant Doppler effect caused by the interference between satellite networks and the high-speed movement of the satellite relative to the ground. In order to improve the target detection efficiency and system security of LEO satellite communication system, blind separation technology is an effective method to process the collision signals received by satellites. Because of the signal has good sparsity in Delay-Doppler domain, in order to improve the blind separation performance of LEO satellite communication system, orthogonal Time-Frequency space (OTFS) modulation is used to convert the sampled signal to Delay-Doppler domain. DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to classify the sparse signal, so as to separate the original mixed signal. Finally, the simulation results show that the method has a good separation effect, and can significantly improve the detection efficiency of system targets and the security of LEO satellite communication system network.

AB With the widespread use of metal organic framework materials (MOF), they inevitably enter the environment and pose potential threats to diverse organisms. Herein, we investigated the impacts of iron-based metal organic framework MIL-53(Fe) on the growth and the activity of nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii. MIL-53 (Fe) inhibited bacterial growth at a relatively low concentration (50 mg/L) and almost complete inhibition occurred at 140 mg/L. However, MIL-53(Fe) did not cause cell death even at high concentrations up to 130 mg/ L. MIL-53(Fe) did not penetrate the cell wall and no cellular uptake was observed. MIL-53(Fe) lowered nifH gene expression of A. vinelandii, resulting in the attenuation of nitrogen fixation activity. MIL-53(Fe) did not arouse meaningful oxidative damage, but there were significant membrane leakage and pinholes in cell wall, indicating the mechanical damage. In addition, MIL-53(Fe) was stable in aqueous systems without obvious Fe release. After removing MIL-53(Fe) from the culture system, there was recovery of growth and nitrogen fixation activity of A. vinelandii that had initially been exposed to 10-130 mg/L of MIL-53(Fe), implying that the damage caused by MIL-53(Fe) to A. vinelandii was reversible. These findings highlighted the reversible environmental toxicity of MOF materials to microorganisms in the nitrogen cycle.

AB Biodiversity and productivity that highly determine ecosystem services are varying largely under global change. However, the climate sensitivity of them and their relationship are not well understood, especially in the context of increasing nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, based on a six-year N manipulation experiment in an alpine meadow, we quantified inter annual climate sensitivity of species richness (SR) and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) as well as SR-ANPP relationship as affected by six N addition rate (N-rate) gradients. We found that interannual variations in ANPP and SR were mainly driven by temperature instead of precipitation. In the plots without N addition, higher temperature substantially increased ANPP but reduced SR across years, thus resulting in a negative SR-ANPP relationship. However, the negative and positive responses of SR and ANPP to temperature increased and declined significantly with increasing N-rate, respectively, leading to a shift of the negative relationship between SR and ANPP into a positive one under high N-rate.Moreover, the adverse influence of drought on SR and ANPP would be aggravated by N fertilization, as indicated by the increased positive effect of precipitation on them under N enrichment. Our findings indicate that climate sensitivity of productivity and biodiversity may be misestimated if the impact of N deposition is not considered, and the importance of biodiversity to maintain productivity would enhance as N deposition increases. This study provides a new insight to explain variation of biodiversity-productivity relationship along with environmental changes.

AB Revealing the distribution patterns of soil nematode communities among climate zones helps uncover the spatial distribution patterns of belowground biodiversity. The aims of this study were to reveal the spatial distribution patterns of the taxonomic composition, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematode communities among continuous climate zones. Investigations were conducted for five altitudinal vegetation types, i.e., subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (SEB), subtropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest (SEDB), warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest (WTDB), mid-temperate coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (MTC) and cold temperate coniferous forest (CTC), on the eastern slope of Gongga Mountain from 2014 to 2017. The taxonomic compositions of the soil nematode communities in the SEDB, WTDB, MTC and CTC were similar but differed markedly from that in the SED, with patterns varying among sampling years. Abundances and diversity showed unimodal distribution patterns, with maximum values occurring in the WTDB. The abundances of the four trophic groups varied significantly among the vegetation types. Relative abundances stabilized for bacterivores and plant parasites but declined for fungivores and increased for omnivores-predators from the SEB to the CTC. The ratio of fungivores to bacterivores in the SEB was significantly higher than those in the other vegetation types, implying that the trophic structure and material cycling channels differed among forest types. The spatial distribution of the soil nematode communities was mainly influenced by pH, total K, total P and soil temperature. These findings suggested that the taxonomic composition, abundance, diversity and trophic structure of soil nematode communities vary among climate zones, but the changes in the soil nematode communities among climate zones did not keep pace with those in aboveground plant communities.

AB Olfaction in vertebrates plays pivotal parts in many aspects, such as localizing prey or food, mating behavior, avoiding predators, and social communication. Yak (Bos grunniens) is the only Bos species that can thrive in high-altitude areas. In view of the critical role of olfactory receptors (ORs) in the specific recognition of diverse stimuli, investigating the evolutionary dynamics of ORs in the yak means a lot. In this study, we used the chromosome-level genome of the yak to identify the ORs genes and discussed the effects of high altitude on the yak's olfaction by comparing the yak with other low-altitude living Bos species (Bos frontalis (gayal), Bos gaurus (gaur), Bos indicus (zebu) and Bos taurus (cattle)). The yak had 400 OR genes, including 264 functional genes, 16 partial genes and 120 OR pseudo genes. There were 387 OR genes mapped to yak 31 chromosomes, and chro-mosomes 13 and 8 had the most OR genes and functional OR genes. Among these five Bos species, yak had the least number of OR gene subfamilies, OR genes and functional OR genes, while the total number of OR genes in gayal (n = 784) was almost twice as many as that of yak, indicating that the olfaction of yak may be less developed. In addition, the phylogenetic relationships of the functional Bos OR genes were illustrated, which comprised 79 families and 466 subfamilies distributed in two classes (Class I and Class II). There were 76 OR gene subfamilies shared by these five Bos species and 17 OR gene subfamilies were unique to the yak. The potential odor specificity of 44 yak OR genes was identified through the similarity to human OR protein se-quences. Remarkably, yak lacks beta-ionone and Isovaleric acid(IVA)-related ORs, which may be related to the decline of high-altitude herbaceous plant diversity and underdeveloped yak sweat glands. The conserved motifs of OR genes were highly conserved in Bos species. These results provided a solid foundation for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of the yak's adaptation to the high-altitude environment in olfaction.

AB Background: Helictotrichon virescens is a perennial grass that is primarily distributed in high altitude areas of 2000-4500m. It is widely cultivated in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, strongly resistant to cold, and an essential part of the wild herbs in this region. However, the molecular mechanism of the response of H. virescens to low temperature stress and the key regulatory genes for specific biological processes are poorly understood.
   Results: Physiological and transcriptome analyses were used to study the cold stress response mechanism in H virescens. During the low temperature stress period, the content of chlorophyll a and b decreased more and more with the delay of the treatment time. Among them, the difference between the controls was not significant, and the difference between the control and the treatment was significant. At the same time, the expression of related differential genes was up-regulated during low temperature treatment. In addition, the plant circadian pathway is crucial for their response to cold stress. The expression of differentially expressed genes that encode LHY and HY5 were strongly up-regulated during cold stress.
   Conclusions: This study should help to fully understand how H. virescens responds to low temperatures. It answers pertinent questions in the response of perennial herbs to cold stress, i.e., how light and low temperature signals integrate to regulate plant circadian rhythms and Decrease of content of chlorophylls (which can be also accompanied with decrease of total quantity of reaction centers) leads to an increase in photosynthetic damage.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in the development of oocytes and ovarian follicles. We have previously shown differential expression of miR-342-3p during yak oocyte maturation. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-342-3p in meiotic maturation of yak oocytes and the underlying mechanism. The profile of ovarian DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression was investigated in yak by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The pattern of Dnmt1 expression in various meiotic stages (GV stage, MI stage and MII stage) of yak oocyte maturation was then measured by immunofluorescence staining. The interaction between Dnmt1 and miR-342-3p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, miR-342-3p inhibitors were microinjected into yak cumulus-oocyte complex to evaluate the effects on oocyte maturation. MiR-342-3p expression was upregulated in oocytes during meiotic maturation, with significantly higher levels in the MII stage compared with the GV- and MI stages (p < .05), whereas the opposite pattern of Dnmt1 expression was detected. In the period to sexual maturity (3-year-old), DNMT1 showed an age-related pattern of ovarian expression at both the gene and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry analysis also indicated maturation-stage-related differences in DNMT1 expression in the ovarian follicles and corpus luteum, with expression predominantly detected in cumulus cells and oocytes. MiR-342-3p inhibitors effectively upregulated Dnmt1 expression and significantly inhibited oocyte meiotic maturation. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-342-3p plays a vital role in the meiotic maturation of yak oocytes by targeting the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of Dnmt1 and provide a new perspective on the mechanism of this process.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Terrestrial ecosystem water retention (TEWR) service is subject to climate change and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (eCO(2)), however, the relevant processes by which future climate change and eCO(2) affect TEWR are poorly understood. Here, we use the factorial simulation experiments from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project to address this research question. The experiments are based on three dynamic global vegetation models forced with the same climate change scenarios. Results suggest that compared to the preindustrial level, during 2070-2099, (a) TEWR change is highly uncertain, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. (b) Climate change will dominate the pattern of future TEWR change compared with eCO(2). (c) Precipitation and runoff change will dominate the future TEWR change in various regions, and the direct role of evapotranspiration (ET) on TEWR will be relatively small. (d) eCO(2) will mainly affect vegetation dynamics in energy-limited regions to affect the runoff, and consequently affecting TEWR change. (e) eCO(2) will decrease ET and increase the runoff, resulting in a slight TWER change. These findings improve the understanding of the responses of TEWR to future climate change and eCO(2).

AB Graphene has found important applications in various areas and hundred tons of graphene materials are annually produced. It is crucial to investigate both the negative and positive environmental effects of graphene materials to ensure the safe applications and develop environmental applications. In this study, we reported the stimulating effects of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter chroococcum. RGO stimulated the cell growth of A. chroococcum at 0.010-0.500 mg/mL according to the growth curves and the colony-forming unit (CFU) increases. RGO wrapped over the A. chroococcum cells without inducing ultrastructural changes. RGO decreased the leakage of cell membrane, but slight oxidative stress was observed in A. chroococcum. RGO promoted the nitrogen fixation activity of A. chroococcum at 0.5 mg/mL according to both isotope dilution method and acetylene reduction activity measurements. Consequently, the increases of soil nitrogen contents were evidenced, in particular about 30% increase of organic nitrogen occurred at 0.5 mg/mL of RGO. In addition, RGO might possibly benefit the plant growth through enhancing the indoleacetic acid production of A. chroococcum. These results highlighted the positive environmental effects of graphene materials to nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nitrogen cycle.

AB Background: Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are important elements for plant metabolism and growth. Therefore, the quantification of the scaling relationship of N to P in plant organs can help us understand many fundamental ecological processes. The general scaling relationships between N and P in leaves and in fine roots have been reported. As compared to leaves and fine roots, however, little information is available on the N versus P scaling relationship in the stems of woody plants, especially for twigs. In this study, a comprehensive dataset comprising 2,038 N=P paired observations for a total of 536 woody species was compiled and analyzed to determine whether a general scaling relationship exists. Results: The global mean values of twig N and P concentrations and N:P ratios were 9.33 mg???g???1, 1.12 mg???g???1 and 10.16, respectively. Twig N and P concentrations and N:P ratios differed significantly within and across functional groups and biomes. Across all of the species, a uniform 0.67 scaling exponent of twig N to P was observed across different functional groups and biomes, i.e., a 2/3-power scaling relationship was observed. However, this numerical value differed across different sites, albeit converging onto 0.67 with increasing sample sizes. Soil total phosphorus was the largest contributor to the variation in the numerical value of the scaling exponent. Conclusion: These results provide useful parameters for stoichiometric growth models, and advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant nutrient dynamics. This study has potential implications in predicting responses of nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystem responses to changes in the environment.

AB A highly efficient and simple route for the synthesis of benzo-5-membered heterocycles sulfides has been developed by the cross-coupling reaction of 2-mercaptobenzo-5-membered heterocycles with (hetero)arylaluminum reagents. Various benzo-5-membered heterocycles sulfides derivatives can be obtained with 32-87% isolated yields under mild reaction conditions. The aryls bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups in 2-mercaptobenzo-5-membered heterocycles gave prod-ucts in 40-78% isolated yields. The broad substrates scope and the typical maintenance of vigorous efficiency on gram scale make this protocol a potentially practical method to synthesize benzo-5-membered heterocycles sulfides derivatives. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible cata-lytic cycle has been proposed. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose Based on path-goal theory and social learning theory, this research is aimed at investigating how authentic leadership can influence team performance in virtual teams, specifically the mechanisms through the mediator of high-quality interpersonal relationships and the moderator of task interdependence. Design/methodology/approach The valid data of this research were collected from 90 virtual teams including 388 team members and their 90 leaders with a time-lag in China, and then the data were mainly analyzed by the hierarchical multiple regression and bootstrapping method to test the hypotheses. Findings The research results reveal that authentic leadership can positively influence virtual team performance. High-quality interpersonal relationships mediate the relationship between authentic leadership and virtual team performance. Furthermore, the indirect relationship between authentic leadership and virtual team performance via high-quality interpersonal relationships is moderated by task interdependence. Originality/value Team performance as an important kind of team effectiveness is crucial to the virtual team's advantage and success. This research enriches the knowledge on the relationship between authentic leadership and virtual team performance, which contributes to the virtual leadership effectiveness and virtual team management.

AB In this study, a total of 143 fecal samples (107 diarrheic and 36 non-diarrheic) were collected from 11 goat farms in southwest China, and 3.7% of diarrheic and 8.3% of non-diarrheic samples were detected as astroviruspositive by RT-PCR. A nearly complete astrovirus genomic sequence (SWUN/F4/2019) of 6278 nucleotides (nt), which contained a 6186 bp open reading frame, was successfully obtained. The genome of strain SWUN/F4/ 2019 shared the highest nt identity (77.0%) and the closest genetic relationship with CapAstV-G5.1. It is worth noting that in the nonstructural protein 1ab, strain SWUN/F4/2019 shared the highest amino acid (aa) identity (93.8%) with strain CapAstV-G5.1; however, its capsid protein shared the highest aa identity (72.7%) with the Sichuan takin astrovirus strain LLT03 and only shared 23.1-64.8% aa identities with all available ovine and caprine astrovirus strains. Interestingly, a region recombination event was predicted in the ORF2 gene of strain SWUN/F4/2019, with CapAstV-G5.1 as the putative major parental strain and CcAstV/roe_deer/SLO/D5-14/ 2014 as the possible minor parental strain. According to the species classification criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), SWUN/F4/2019 may represent a novel astrovirus in goats. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of astrovirus in goats in China and a novel astrovirus strain was identified in goats. These findings increase the understanding of the epidemic and the genetic evolution of astroviruses.

AB Surface characteristics of the biomaterials have significant effects on response of osteoblast and formation of new bone tissue. In this study, to improve the bio-performance of polyimide (PI) as an implantable material for bone substitute, concentrated sulfuric acid suspension with tantalum (V) oxide (vTO) submicro-particles of 10w% (PIST10) and 15w% (PIST15) was utilized to modify PI surface. After sulfonation, microporous coatings including vTO particles were created on PI (PIST10 and PIST15) while microporous coating without vTO particles was also created on PI (PIS). Results showed that surface roughness, hydrophilicity and protein adsorption of PIST15 was remarkably higher than PIST10 and PIS. Furthermore, after soaking into simulated body fluid (SBF), no apatite mineralization on PIS was found, while PIST15 with high vTO content exhibited better apatite mineralization compared with PIST10. Moreover, PIS showed low antibacterial property, while PIST15 with high vTO content revealed better antibacterial property compared with PIST10. In addition, cellular response (such as adhesion, proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity) of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) of rat to PIST15 was higher than PIST10 and PIS. In conclusion, the microporous coating of PIST15 including vTO submicroparticles possessed good antibacterial property and bioactivity, which significantly promoted the responses of BMSC. Therefore, PIST15 has potential application prospects for bone substitute.

DE Change-point detection; dynamic networks; hypothesis testing; network
   data; Tracy-Widom distribution
AB It has become an increasingly common practice in modern science and engineering to collect samples of multiple network data in which a network serves as a basic data object. The increasing prevalence of multiple network data calls for developments of models and theories that can deal with inference problems for populations of networks. In this work, we propose a general procedure for hypothesis testing of networks and in particular, for differentiating distributions of two samples of networks. We consider a very general framework which allows us to perform test on large and sparse networks. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) We propose a test statistics based on the singular value of a generalized Wigner matrix. The asymptotic null distribution of the statistics is shown to follow the Tracy-Widom distribution as the number of nodes tends to infinity. The test also yields asymptotic power guarantee with the power tending to one under the alternative; (2) The test procedure is adapted for change-point detection in dynamic networks which is proven to be consistent in detecting the change-points. In addition to theoretical guarantees, another appealing feature of this adapted procedure is that it provides a principled and simple method for selecting the threshold that is also allowed to vary with time. Extensive simulation studies and real data analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our procedure with competitors.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION; SPARSE; DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM; MODEL
AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are inevitably degraded in the acquisition process by mixed noise including Gaussian noise, impulse noise, stripes, and so on. Recently, many low-rank regularization based HSI restoration methods have been proposed to powerfully remove the mixed noise. However, most of them use the square patch based denoising strategy, which destroyed the boundary information of the objects in the HSI. In this paper, we adopt superpixel segmentation to group the pixels of HSI with adjacent position, similar color, texture and luminance into a homogeneous region, whose shape is adaptive. Several homogeneous regions cover the full HSI. This is better than simply dividing the HSI into square patches. By taking advantage of both the low-rank property and the spectral smooth of the HSI, this approach can efficiently remove the mixed noise with few time. Several experiments verify the performance of the proposed approach for HSI restoration. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Heterostructural engineering and noble metal coupling are effective strategies to optimize semiconductor photocatalytic materials. In this work, (Ag, Mn2O3)-codecorated ZnO nanoparticles with different Mn2O3 contents (0-10 mol%) were synthesized by integrating the two strategies by a facile two-step polymer network-gel process. The photocatalytic activity of Ag/ZnO (AZM0) was significantly enhanced with the optimum Mn2O3 molar ratio of 3 mol%. The degradation efficiency of AZM3 is similar to 3 times and similar to 4.8 times higher than that of AZM0 for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) upon exposure to simulated sunlight and visible light, respectively. Also, this ternary nanocomposite exhibits enhanced gas sensing performance towards NO2 under ultraviolet/visible light irradiation at room temperature. The analysis of its microstructural, optical and photoelectrical characteristics suggests the synergistic coupling effects of Ag and Mn2O3, in which the significantly enhanced visible light response and hetero-interface charge carrier migration are the critical factors for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency and gas sensing activity. Furthermore, the effects of recycling ability, the influence of the initial solution pH, the catalyst dosage and the main active species during the catalysis process on photocatalytic activity were explored. This study develops a feasible pathway to consciously construct multiheterostructures for enhancing the photocatalytic activity with great potential applications in toxic pollution abatement and noxious gas detection.

AB Owing to the complexity of the composition of herbal and dietary supplements, it is a challenging problem to efficiently screen and identify active or toxic compounds. Psoralea corylifolia L. (PCL) was selected as the subbject to establish a methodology for rapid screening and identification of hepatotoxic compounds. High-content imaging, ultra-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used in this study to detect the hepatotoxicity and identify unknown compounds in PCL samples. Then, putative toxic compounds which are highly related to hepatotoxicity were screened by spectrum-toxicity correlation analysis, and the toxicity intensity verified by high-content imaging. The maximum nontoxic dose of processed samples with good detoxification effect reduced more than 9 times compared with unprocessed raw medicinal materials. Spectrum-toxicity correlation analysis showed that bavachinin A, bavachin, isobavachalcone and neobavaisoflavone had high correlation with the hepatotoxicity of PCL, and psoralen and isopsoralen had low correlation with hepatotoxicity. This study verified the hepatotoxicity of these six putative compound monomers, proving the results of spectrum-toxicity correlation analysis. Based on the correlation analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometry of detection compounds and high-content imaging of hepatocyte toxicity data, the potential toxic compound of herbal and dietary supplement products can be quickly and accurately screened.

AB The analysis of intraday financial time series is the basis of constructing intraday trading strategies which are usually less risky than overnight trading strategies. Correlations existed in intraday financial series may imply there are some potential patterns of price movements. In this work, we propose a clustering framework based on multi-scale analysis of intraday financial time series to seek these potential patterns. The clustering framework include a new method based on multi-scale analysis of time series to measure the similarity between intraday financial time series, and quantitative indexes constructed to evaluate the clustering effect of intraday financial time series. We use different types of clustering algorithms to verify our clustering framework on the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300), the Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500) and the Nikkei 225 index (N225), and find that our proposed framework can clearly distinguish different classes of intraday financial time series.

TI Environmental Investment Decision of Green Supply Chain considering the
   Green Uncertainty
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
ID GAME; COORDINATION; INNOVATION; CONTRACTS
AB The uncertainty of eco-friendly intermediate components has an important impact on green supply chain decisions. In this paper, the Stackelberg game model of green investment decision-making among enterprises is established by considering the case of the supplier's green investment alone and the case of the manufacturer and the supplier's joint green investment. The influence of green uncertainty on enterprise's decision-making is analyzed, and the green investment decision-making strategies of both sides in two cases are compared. There are four main conclusions derived from the results: (i) with the increase in the supplier's green cost coefficient, the supplier will reduce the green investment and the manufacturer will reduce the share of the green costs; (ii) with a decrease in uncertainty for eco-friendly intermediate components and the increase in their feasibility factor, the supplier will increase the greenness of intermediate components and increase the investment in environment, and the manufacturer will reduce the share of the green costs; (iii) the increase in the manufacturer's share of green costs will promote the supplier to increase the greenness of intermediate components and increase its green investment, which shall increase the supplier's optional choice space of for green investment; (iv) in the case of the manufacturer and the supplier jointly making a green investment, the threshold value for the environmental input of the supply chain members (i.e., the manufacturer and the supplier) is lower, and the supply chain members will have more choice space. At the same time, the care for environment in the case of a cooperative is higher than that in the case of a supplier investing alone.

AB Conditions in early life play profound and long-lasting effects on the welfare and adaptability to stress of chickens. This study aimed to explore the hypothesis that the provision of environmental complexity in early life improves birds' adaptive plasticity and ability to cope with a challenge later in life. It also tried to investigate the effect of the gut-brain axis by measuring behavior, stress hormone, gene expression, and gut microbiota. One-day-old chicks were split into 3 groups: (1) a barren environment (without enrichment items) group (BG, n = 40), (2) a litter materials group (LG, n = 40), and (3) a perches with litter materials group (PLG, n = 40). Then, enrichment items were removed and simulated as an environmental challenge at 31 to 53 d of age. Birds were subjected to a predator test at 42 d of age. In the environmental challenge, when compared with LG, PLG birds were characterized by decreased fearfulness, lower plasma corticosterone, improved gut microbial functions, lower relative mRNA expression of GR, and elevated mRNA expressions of stressrelated genes CRH, BDNF, and NR2A in the hypothalamus (all P < 0.05). Unexpectedly, the opposite was true for the LG birds when compared with the BG (P < 0.05). Decreased plasma corticosterone and fearfulness were accompanied by altered hypothalamic gene mRNA expressions of BDNF, NR2A, GR, and CRH through the HPA axis in response to altered gut microbial compositions and functions. The findings suggest that gut microbiota may integrate fearfulness, plasma corticosterone, and gene expression in the hypothalamus to provide an insight into the gut-brain axis in chicks. In conclusion, having access to both perches and litter materials in early life allowed birds to cope better with a future challenge. Birds in perches and litter materials environment may have optimal development and adaptive plasticity through the gut-brain axis.

AB The mechanisms underlying yak adaptation to high-altitude environments have been investigated using various methods, but no report has focused on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In the present study, lncRNAs were screened from the gluteus transcriptomes of yak and their transcriptional levels were compared with those in Sanjiang cattle, Holstein cattle and Tibetan cattle. The potential target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs between species/strains were predicted using cis and trans models. Based on cis-regulated target genes, no KEGG pathway was significantly enriched. Based on trans-regulated target genes, 11 KEGG pathways in relation to energy metabolism and three KEGG pathways associated with muscle contraction were significantly enriched. Compared with cattle strains, transcriptional levels of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA-binding protein, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were relatively higher and those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, pyruvate kinase and lactate/malate dehydrogenase were relatively lower in yak, suggesting that yaks activated fatty acid oxidation but inhibited glucose oxidation and glycolysis. Besides, NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase showed lower transcriptional levels in yak than in cattle, which might protect muscle tissues from deterioration caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared with cattle strains, the higher transcriptional level of glyoxalase in yak might contribute to dicarbonyl stress resistance. Voltage-dependent calcium channel/calcium release channel showed a lower level in yak than in cattle strains, which could reduce the Ca2+ influx and subsequently decrease the risk of hypertension. However, levels of EF-hand and myosin were higher in yak than in cattle strains, which might enhance the negative effects of reduced Ca2+ on muscle contraction. Overall, the present study identified lncRNAs and proposed their potential regulatory functions in yak.

AB Yak milk, a high-quality milk, is one of the best raw materials for dairy products and economically important to pastoral herdsmen. To make a further understanding of the molecular differences in mammary tissues of the yaks with different milk production during lactation, in this study, we took the use of RNA-seq to perform high-throughput sequencing and analysis of the mammary gland transcriptomes of both high-yielding yak and low-yielding yaks during lactation. By the comparison and analysis of the transcriptome data for the mammary gland tissue of high-yielding yak and low-yield yak, 144 differential genes were screened out, of which 49 were upregulated and 95 were downregulated. Further functional analysis indicated that these differential genes involved in multiple classes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and multiple Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The GO analysis showed that the functions of the differential genes are closely related to the carbohydrate metabolism and other biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes are mostly enriched in the pathway of antigen processing and presentation, phagosome pathway and type I diabetes pathway and enriched followed by extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway. Moreover, several other pathways related to amino acid metabolism also showed significant enrichment. Here, the mammary gland transcriptomes of high-yielding yak and low-yielding yaks during lactation have for the first time been compared, and the related differential genes have been screened out and analyzed. Our study paves a way for the further elucidation of the basic molecular mechanism of yak mammary gland tissue, and at the same time provides new ideas for improving the milk production of yaks.

AB Ambient radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting technology provides a hopeful solution to power the low-power electronic system. Nevertheless, the extremely low power density and randomness of ambient RF energy pose a significant obstacle to the application of ambient RF energy harvesting technology. Aiming at wireless transmission by ambient RF-powered sensors, this paper presents a cooperative communication technology by combining ambient backscattering and energy beamforming to significantly decrease the transmission energy consumption of each sensor. For wireless transmission via this cooperative communication technology, a novel optimization problem is formulated to maximize the long-term time-averaged sensed data size, which jointly takes into account sensing scheduling, transmission power allocation and the control of sensed data size. Moreover, we employ techniques of Lyapunov drift and Lyapunov optimization to propose an online optimal control algorithm, which achieves the optimal solution to the proposed problem without requiring a-priori knowledge of harvested energy and wireless channels. By exploiting mixed integer programming (MIP) and signomial geometric programming (SGP) that cause the proposed problem difficult to solve, a novel Sequential Convex Approximation algorithm is further introduced into the online optimal control algorithm. Simulation results indicate the proposed online algorithm offers a dramatic performance gain over alternative online algorithms.

AB KLF9 is reported to promote adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells and pigs. However, the roles of KLF9 in adipocytes differentiation of goat remain unknown. In this study, the expression profiles of KLF9 were different between subcutaneous and intramuscular preadipocytes of goat during differentiation process. After silencing KLF9 gene, the lipid droplets were increased in both two types of adipocytes. In subcutaneous preadipocyte with silencing KLF9, the expressions of C/EBP beta, PPAR gamma, LPL, KLF1-2, KLF5, and KLF17 genes were up-regulated, while KLF12, KLF4, and KLF13 genes were down-regulated in expression level. In intramuscular preadipocyte, aP2, C/EBP alpha, KLF2-3, KLF5, and KLF7 gene were up-regulated, and Pref-1 gene was down-regulated. In addition, the binding sites of KLF9 existed in the promoters of aP2, C/EBP alpha, C/EBP beta, LPL and Pref-1. Taken together, KLF9 play a negative role in the differentiation of both intramuscular and subcutaneous preadipocytes in goats, but the functional mechanism may be different.

AB In realistic numerical optimization problems, the efficiency of the algorithm is a crucial consideration. Fitness landscape approximation is beneficial for improving the search efficiency in evolutionary algorithms, but this method increases the computational cost significantly with an increase in the dimension. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired algorithm with dimension decomposition and fitness landscape approximation. The high-dimensional problem space is transformed into a low-dimensional projection space for fitness landscape approximation through mapping transformation. Linear approximation for the fitness landscape is performed in the transformed multiple 1D projected spaces. In accordance with two different diversity-retaining strategies, reference sampling points with different characteristics are selected to perform two-point linear approximation. Candidate points in the projection space are estimated and then synthesized as candidate solutions in the problem space. Then, candidate solutions are used in an appropriate population reconstruction mechanism to improve the performance of the algorithm. The proposed algorithms are implemented on benchmark functions abstracted from real-world optimization problems and compared with several algorithms. Experimental results on errors, success rates, and their rankings show the superiority of the proposed approach with the solution diversity priority with regard to effectiveness, adaptability, and stability.

The phase structure, microstructure, and electrical properties have been discussed in detail. The good comprehensive properties (d(33) similar to 390 pC/N; T-C similar to 302 degrees C, S-pos similar to 0.121%, S-uni similar to 0.133%, d(33)* similar to 404 pm/V) can be obtained for the ceramic of x = 0.040 with R-T ferroelectric phase co-existence near room temperature. Moreover, a good temperature stability of S-uni (S-125 degrees C /S-RT similar to 84.09%) in the ceramics with x = 0.040 is obtained at the temperature range of room temperature to 125 degrees C. The enhancement of electrical properties as well as higher Curie temperature (d(33) similar to 390 pC/N; T-C similar to 302 degrees C) indicates that KNNS-0.040(BNZ-BS) ceramic is a promising lead-free piezoceramic, especially in high temperature applied field.

AB Activity changes after olive oil (OO), pomegranate seed oil (PSO), and grape seed oil (GSO) were formulated into self-nanoemulsifying systems (SNES), were examined in this study. Only GSO SNES dramatically enhanced antioxidant activity of GSO. SNES from OO and PSO did not exert obvious impact on radical quenching ability of the oils. Though PSO exhibited significantly stronger strength over OO in suppressing E. coli (p < 0.05), the inhibitory effect of OO SNES against E. coli became slightly higher than that of PSO SNES. Similar phenomenon happened in GSO, OO, and their SNES for preventing Yeast growth. The study indicated that SNES sometimes reversed the strength order of the original oils in inhibiting bacteria.

AB Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) plays a central role in promoting follicle maturation through the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-mediated cAMP pathway in animals. The objectives of the present study were to clone the FSHR gene of yaks (Bos grunniens) and compare differences in FSHR mRNA expression in the reproductive axis between yaks and cattle. Hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, oviduct, ovary, and uterus tissue samples were collected from adult female yaks (n = 5) and cattle (n = 5) during the follicular phase. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we found that the FSHR coding region of the yak is 2088 bp and encodes 695 amino acids. Its amino acid sequence showed 9938%-72.22% similarity to the homologous genes of cattle, goats, sheep, cats, donkeys, horses, humans, chickens, monkeys, mice, rats, and wild boar. Realtime PCR analysis revealed that the FSHR gene was expressed in all tissues examined. Expression of the FSHR gene in the yak was higher in the uterus than other tissues (P < 0.05) but, in cattle, was higher in the ovary than other tissues (P < 0.05). The FSHR gene expression level in the cattle ovary was significantly higher than that in the yak ovary (P < 0.01). These results indicate that the FSHR gene is relatively conserved in the course of animal evolution. The variation in sequence and expression level of FSHR between the two species might be associated with the difference in their reproduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB RGO/SnO2 nanocomposites were prepared by a simple blending method and then airbrushed on interdigitated electrodes to obtain the corresponding gas sensors. The characterizations of SEM, TEM, Raman, XRD and FTIR were used to characterize the microstructures, morphologies and surface chemical compositions of the nanocomposites, indicating that the two materials coexist in the composite films and the concentration of surface defects is affected by the amount of SnO2 nanoparticles. It is also found that the room temperature sensing performance of RGO to NO2 can be improved by introducing appropriate amount of SnO2 nanoparticles. The enhanced NO2 sensing properties are attributed to the rough surface structure and increased surface area and surface defects of the nanocomposite films. Since further reduction of RGO, heat treating the sensing films resulted in a decrease in the response and recovery times of the sensors. Furthermore, the sensor annealed at 200 degrees C exhibited a small baseline drift, wide detection range, good linearity, high stability and better selectivity.

DE Pseudogemini surfactants; Krafft temperature; Worm-like micelles;

ID WORMLIKE MICELLES; BEHAVIOR; AMIDE
AB Bola-type quaternary ammonium salt can bridge with two fatty acid soaps through electrostatic attraction to form a pseudogemini surfactant, which enhances the solution viscosity. In this work, the effects of the building blocks (spacer and hydrophobic chain) of a pseudogemini surfactant on the Krafft temperature, critical micelle concentration, and rheological properties were investigated. The results revealed that the addition of bola-type salt obviously decreased the Krafft temperature of sodium stearate (C18ONa), and a bola-type salt bearing a large benzene ring (Bola2be) was more effective than the one bearing an ethyl group (Bola2et) or a hydroxyethyl group (Bola2hy). When bola-type salt is mixed with fatty acid soap at a fixed molar ratio of 1:2, a pseudogemini surfactant forms in situ, and the viscosity of the solution is significantly enhanced by the formation of a worm-like micelle (WLM) network. The stronger the hydrophobicity of the bola-type salt or the tail of the fatty acid soap, the lower the critical overlapping and micelle concentrations, and the stronger is the ability to enhance viscosity. However, pseudogemini surfactants that use sodium stearate as a monomer show similar self-assembly abilities to those using sodium oleate as a monomer. In addition, the WLM formed by pseudogemini surfactants composed of Bola2be and sodium stearate or sodium oleate were liable to branch at high concentrations.

AB This paper investigates the problems of exponential stability and robust control for a general class of uncertain singular nonlinear switched systems subject to impulsive perturbations. An effective computational method is introduced for designing switched linear feedback controllers, which is based on the novel conditions on the solvability of the control problem. The idea for decomposing the singular impulsive increments is applied in this development, which establishes some criteria on exponential stability. Comparing with some existing results on singular switched systems, this design is not only less conservative but also with reduced computational complexity. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical examples.

AB Seed dormancy is an important trait determining seed germination and seedling establishment of plants. Despite extensive studies on seed dormancy, relatively few studies have specifically focused on mechanisms underlying seed dormancy in wild perennial species. Leymus chinensis is a perennial grass forage with excellent nutritional value and one of the dominant species in the Eurasian steppe. In this study, the proteomic features for seed dormancy and release in the wild germplasm after ripening were analyzed by iTRAQ technology. Based on the wheat (Triticwn aestivum) protein database, a total of 281 differently expressed proteins were identified in L. chinensis non-dormant seeds versus dormant seeds, with 188 differentially decreased (fold change < 0.8, P < 0.05) and 93 differentially increased proteins (fold change > 1.2, P < 0.05). Based on the COG annotation, the proteins involved in chromatin structure and dynamics, intracellular trafficking, section, and vesicular transport, cytoskeleton were all increased differentially. In contrast, the proteins involved in RNA processing and modification, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and signal transduction mechanisms were all decreased differentially. Based on the Mapman annotation and function enrichment, the decreased proteins mainly participated in photosynthesis and TCA cycle, while the increased proteins were involved in protein targeting, degradation, and synthesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox, cell cycle, and DNA synthesis/ chromatin structure. After-ripening of L. chinensis dormant seeds was the transition from maturation to storage. Our proteomic analyses revealed that the dormancy release of L. chinensis seeds was related to the increases in tubulin, histone, and thioredoxins, and the decrease in L- ascorbate peroxidase. Based on these results, we proposed that an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) during after-ripening is an important driver to regulate dormancy release in L. chinensis seeds by modulating cytoskeleton and chromatin. These findings provide new insight for our mechanistic understanding of dormancy control in perennial grass forage.

AB A highly enantioselective (84-97% ee) cascade Michael/acyl transfer reaction of alpha-nitroketones to a wide range of 2-hydroxychalcones was established in the presence of a bifunctional squaramide. Although aliphatic alpha-nitroketones were revealed to be a class of challenging substrates with unsatisfactory reactivity or enantioselectivity by previous reports, good isolated yields and excellent enantiopurities have been achieved via our catalytic protocol. gamma-Nitroketones created by this new methodology were versatile building blocks possessing profound further synthetic utility.

AB This paper studies traveling waves of the (3 + 1)-dimensional Jimbo-Miwa equation comprehensively and systematically. By transforming its traveling wave system into a dynamical system in R-3, we apply the bifurcation method of dynamical system to investigate its phase space geometry in detail and obtain the parameter bifurcation sets in which various types of bounded and unbounded traveling waves are identified and simulated. Furthermore, by calculating the complicated elliptic integrals, without any loss, we give exact expressions of all traveling wave solutions of the (3 + 1)-dimensional Jimbo-Miwa equation, including the bounded and unbounded ones.

AB The construction and running of hydropower plants does not merely involve hydropower generation itself but also facilities surveillance, water quality monitoring, harmful creatures tracking, etc., thus requiring mobile and collaborative monitoring capabilities. MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Networks), with its mobility, flexibility, and robustness in volatile networking environment, is a competitive candidate to fulfill such tasks. Nevertheless its distributed structure prevents the effective collaboration between MANET nodes. SDN (Software-Defined Networking) provides the centralized control over the network underlay. This paper proposes the SDN-controlled IEEE 802.11 MANET swarm for mobile monitoring in hydropower plants. First, the MANET node is implemented by integrating Raspberry Pi with cameras, various sensors, etc., into the low-cost wheeled mobile hardware to enable sensibility and mobility. Then, multiple such MANET nodes are networked through ad hoc protocols, to construct a flexible and distributed MANET underlay; meanwhile, to implement centralized control over the MANET underlay, every MANET node is equipped with OpenFlow switch software (e.g., Open vSwitch) so that OpenFlow directives issued by the SDN controller can be understood and executed, hence the SDN overlay on top of the MANET underlay. Finally, OpenFlow is extended to offer physical actions such as mobility and sensibility manipulation, beyond pure data forwarding in traditional SDN applications, to achieve mobile monitoring in hydropower plants. The SDN-controlled MANET swarm features mobile and sensing capabilities, flexible networking through ad hoc protocols, and efficient and unified control by SDN. Experiment results prove the feasibility of this network architecture.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multistage 20-m shuttle-run test (20-m SRT) in assessing the physical fitness of Chinese children and adolescents in Shanghai. Methods A total of 4833 children and adolescents (2437 males and 2396 females, aged 7-17 years) were enrolled in this study. Height, weight, body fat percentage, fat-free mass, BMI, and skinfold thickness were measured or calculated. The participants were randomly grouped for performing the 20-m SRT. The maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max and VO2max/kg) was estimated from the 20-m SRT using the model of Leger et al. Results All the measured and calculated parameters (age, height, weight, body fat percentage, fat-free mass, BMI, skinfold thickness, and the results of the 20-m SRT, as well as the estimated VO2max and VO2(max/kg)) had significant correlations with each other (P < .05). The multiple regression analyses indicated that (1) results of the 20-m SRT were significantly associated with age, sex, height, and fat-free mass (P < .05); (2) VO2max/kg was significantly associated with sex, age, weight, BMI, fat-free mass, and skinfold thickness (P < .001); and (3) VO2max was markedly associated with sex, age, height, weight, BMI, fat-free mass, and skinfold thickness (P < .001). There were differences between males and females in the results of multiple regression analyses. Conclusions
   Results of the 20-m SRT and the estimated VO2max and VO2max/kg from the 20-m SRT can be used for evaluating the physical fitness of children and adolescents in Shanghai. Gender may be a factor affecting the effectiveness of the 20-m SRT.

AB This paper addresses the observer-based H-infinity control of Markovian jump systems with interval time-varying delays and incomplete transition rates. To reduce the conservatism of proposed results, a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed, where an improved delay partitioning method is used by partitioning the delay interval into multiple segments with a geometric sequence. Moreover, the Jensen-based integral inequality and the reciprocally convex technique are used to tackle the time-varying delays. Some less conservative stochastic stability criteria are derived in the framework of linear matrix inequalities. Then, the observer-based H-infinity controller is designed. Finally, three numerical examples are given to demonstrate the merit and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Farm animals raised under free-range (FR) systems are assumed to have improved welfare and higher-quality products that are better to eat than intensively reared animals. However, the modulations are limited in scientific investigations. In this study, we compared 2 rearing systems (FR and cage) and their effects on chickens, including production performance, product quality, body condition, physiological indicators, and gene expression. By using a match-mismatch design in which each treatment was transferred to the other treatment during the last period of the experiment, we aimed to understand the influence of current and former rearing conditions and the ability of individuals to adapt to the current environment. The results indicated that the FR system led to better chicken welfare (e.g., gait score, feather condition, and physiological indicators, P < 0.05) and contributed to higher product quality (P < 0.05), although it resulted in poorer production performance (P < 0.05) and foot pad condition (P < 0.05) than that of the cage rearing system. Additionally, the FR system triggered a series of inner changes and genetic responses in chickens, such as the upregulation of calcium and GnRH signaling, actin and cytoskeleton regulations, immune functions, and developmental processes, and the downregulation of pathological regulations (q-value < 0.05 for all gene ontology terms and P < 0.05 for all Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways). In conclusion, rearing systems alter chicken gene expression patterns, which provide a genetic basis for the adaptability to rearing environments and ultimately affects chicken welfare and products.

AB The dispersion of graphene in water has generally been considered an insurmountable challenge owing to its hydrophobic nature. In this study, a new type of light-sensitive polymer/graphene composite (AzoPEO/beta-CD-RGO) was synthesized by the reversible host-guest interaction between azobenzene-terminal poly(ethylene oxide) (AzoPEO) and a beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) host attached to the surface of graphene via hydrogen bonding. In water, the AzoPEO/ beta-CD-RGO composite not only is well dispersed, but also exhibits reversible dispersion/aggregation behavior triggered by UV and visible light. Moreover, the graphene composite can be used to fabricate a light-responsive graphene-based drug delivery system. This kind of light-responsive graphene composite, which efficiently allows the control of graphene dispersion/aggregation, may find wide applications in the preparation of intelligent drug delivery systems, smart sensors, and switching devices.

AB Resina Draconis is a highly valued traditional medicine widely used in Arabia since ancient times, and it has been commonly used as an antidiarrheic, antimicrobial, antiulcer, blood circulation promoter as well as an anti-inflammatory agent. The tree source from which this medicine orignates grows extremely slowly, producing a very low yield of Resina Draconis. To meet the increasing market demand, artificial methods for stimulating Resina Draconis formation have been developed and applied. However, the chemical differences between artificially induced Resina Draconis (AIRD) and natural Resina Draconis (NRD) have been rarely studied. The aim of this research was to explore and identify the chemical constituents of AIRD and NRD using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) based chemical profiling. A total of 56 chromatographic peaks were detected in AIRD, of these, 44 peaks have had their structures tentatively characterized based on high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) data, fragmentation ions information, reference standards data and literature review. In total, 40 peaks were found both in AIRD and NRD. The potential chemical transformation mechanisms active in Resina Draconis during formation were explored. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of the chemical profiles of both AIRD and NRD. Furthermore, these findings are expected to provide a rational basis for the quality assessment of AIRD and the use of AIRD as a substitute for NRD.

AB In this report, a series of polycations are designed and synthesized by conjugating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive thioacetal-linkers to low molecular weight (LMW) polyethylenimine (PEI) via ring-opening polymerization. Their structure-activity relationships (SARs) as gene delivery vectors are systematically studied. Although the MWs of the target polymers are only similar to 9 KDa, they show good DNA binding ability. The formed polyplexes, which are stable toward serum but decomposed under ROS-conditions, have appropriate sizes (180 similar to 300 nm) and positive zeta-potentials (+35 similar to 50 mV). In vitro experiments reveal that these materials have low cytotoxicity, and higher transfection efficiency (TE) than controls. Furthermore, the title polymers exhibit excellent serum tolerance. With the present of 10% serum, the TE of the polymers even increases up to 10 times higher than 25 KDa PEI and 9 times higher than Lipofectamine 2000. The SAR studies also reveal that electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring in 4a may benefit to balance between the DNA condensation and release for efficient gene transfection.

AB 1. Muscle regulatory factors (MRFs), including Myf5, Myf6 (MRF4/herculin), MyoD and MyoG (myogenin), play pivotal roles in muscle growth and development. Therefore, they are considered as candidate genes for meat production traits in livestock and poultry.2. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of these genes in skeletal muscles (breast muscle and thigh muscle) at 5 developmental stages (0, 81, 119, 154 and 210 d old) of Tibetan chickens. Relationships between expressions of these genes and growth and carcass traits in these chickens were also estimated.3. The expression profiles showed that in the breast muscle of both genders the mRNA levels of MRF genes were highest on the day of hatching, then declined significantly from d 0 to d 81, and fluctuated in a certain range from d 81 to d 210. However, the expression of Myf5, Myf6 and MyoG reached peaks in the thigh muscle in 118-d-old females and for MyoD in 154-d-old females, whereas the mRNA amounts of MRF genes in the male thigh muscle were in a narrow range from d 0 to d 210.4. Correlation analysis suggested that gender had an influence on the relationships of MRF gene expression with growth traits. The RNA levels of MyoD, Myf5 genes in male breast muscle were positively related with several growth traits of Tibetan chickens (P<0.05). No correlation was found between expressions of MRF genes and carcass traits of the chickens.5. These results will provide a base for functional studies of MRF genes on growth and development of Tibetan chickens, as well as selective breeding and resource exploration.

AB This paper studies the problem of delay-dependent passivity for uncertain neural networks (UNNs) with discrete and distributed delays. Without considering free weighting matrices and multiple integral terms, which may cause more numbers of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and scalar decision variables. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and combining with the reciprocally convex approach, some sufficient conditions are established in terms of LMIs. Compared with existing results, the derived criteria are more effective due to the application of delay partitioning approach which takes a full consideration of all available information in various delay intervals. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We performed a meta-analysis to systematically review the gastrointestinal (GI) events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia) of five newly approved (after 2011) VEGFR-TKIs in cancer patients.
   The relevant studies of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and axitinib were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted.
   Forty-one randomized controlled trials and 10,860 patients were included. Current analysis suggested that the use of these agents increased the risk of all-grade and high-grade GI events, and the diarrhea was the most common GI events. The risk of all-grade and high-grade GI events varies significantly within drug types, tumor types, and VEGFR-TKIs-based regimens.
   The available data suggested that the use of the five newly approved VEGFR-TKIs may increase risk of GI events in cancer patients. Physicians and patients should be aware of these risks and frequent monitoring and careful management should be emphasized when managing these VEGFR-TKIs.

AB A recently reported liquid-crystal sensor system based on the substrate competitive inclusion effects of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) has been investigated using molecular dynamics simulations in this work. In such a system, the released indicator could induce an orientational transition of liquid-crystals from planar to homeotropic. The analyte molecule can thus be easily and efficiently detected by observing the corresponding optical image changing from bright to dark. Here, the different binding affinity of beta-CD for the indicator (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and the analyte (methylene blue, MB) was identified using molecular dynamics simulations and absolute binding free energy calculations. The inclusion processes calculated using the adaptive biasing force algorithm can completely explain the competitive inclusion between MB and SDS by beta-CD, and thus lead to a significant change in the liquid crystal optical properties.

AB Polydopamine-coated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@ PDA) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared as synergistic redox mediators for the catalytic reduction, by NaBH4, of azo dyes such as methyl orange (MO) and methyl red (MR). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were applied to determine their surface morphology, surface chemistry and detailed chemical composition, respectively. The latter technique confirmed the presence of quinone moieties. Moreover, a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) was used to confirm the superparamagnetic properties of these NPs. The characteristic optical absorption maximum of MO at 462 nm was used to monitor the decolorization process. This was employed to determine the catalytic activity in the reaction. An enhancement of the catalytic activity of the magnetic-separable Fe3O4@ PDA nanocatalyst over that of PDA microspheres (MPs) was observed. Moreover, their reusability and stability were also investigated. A synergistic electron transfer mechanism involving both Fe3O4 and PDA moieties was proposed as follows: the quinone moieties and Fe (III) species in Fe3O4@ PDA NPs served as systematic redox mediators, with quinone receiving an electron from NaBH4. The reduced quinone next transfers an electron to the Fe (III) moiety, generating an Fe (II) species that in turn transfers an electron to the azo dye. We determined that this process resulted in enhanced reductive degradation of azo dyes when compared with PDA MPs. Moreover, Fe3O4@ PDA NPs could be magnetically separated and recycled. We therefore concluded that these NPs show great potential in the immobilization of homogeneous catalysts in the chemical reduction processes of azo dyes.

AB In mammalian cells, DNA polymerase xi (Pol xi) catalyzes the TLS step of ICLR. By acting simultaneously with Y-family DNA polymerase, Pol xi completes replication of damaged DNA without removing the damage by inserting a nucleotide opposite the lesion. It has been demonstrated that Pol xi represents a promising target for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The first series of small-molecule inhibitors targeting REV7/REV3L interaction have been identified recently, however, their corresponding binding mechanism is not known. Herein, we performed docking, molecular dynamics and MM/PBSA free energy calculations to study the binding mechanism of REV7 and its inhibitors. It was demonstrated that inhibitors bind to the two pockets divided by the 'safety-belt' structure of REV7, which was supported by the MD simulation. In addition, 2-methylfuran is an important group with an appropriate size to form the stable complex, and hydrophobic contacts were mainly responsible for stable complex formation as revealed by free energy calculation.

AB This work presents the investigation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a new type of stationary phase for gas chromatographic separation on a microcolumn which is fabricated on a silicon wafer by the application of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) techniques. A ZnO film synthesized by a sol-gel method is utilized as a supporting material between RGO and the column wall for inwall roughening to form a stable RGO stationary phase and increase gas-stationary phase interaction. The RGO/ZnO grafted on the column wall was characterized by SEM and FT-IR spectra. The experimental results demonstrate that good separations for mixtures of a wide range of organic compounds including alkanes and esters are achieved by the microcolumn coated with bilayer film. And the maximum column efficiency of 11 363 theoretical plates per meter for n-dodecane is obtained, which is higher than any previously reported values for chromatography columns coated with graphene and their analogs to the best of our knowledge. However, the RGO stationary phase shows obvious peak tailings for polar alcohols, which mainly originate from its specific p-p stacking interaction as well as the hydrophobic effect between analytes and the p-electron on the high surface area of reduced graphene oxide. This work greatly favors RGO coated chip columns for gas chromatographic separation in achieving micro-total analytical systems.

AB Staphylococcal enterotoxin I (SEI) is associated with staphylococcal food poisoning, but little is known about different food preservatives on the production of SEI. In this study, the effect of different food preservatives (sodium nitrite, polylysine, chitosan, and tea catechin) on the bacteria growth, sei gene expression, and extracellular SEI production of Staphylococcus aureus isolate H4 was detected in tryptone soya broth (TSB) culture. Our results showed that all of these preservatives depressed S. aureus H4 growth and the order of inhibitory effect was 0.8 g/L tea catechin > 6 g/L chitosan > 0.25 g/L polylysine > 0.4 g/L tea catechin > 0.15 g/L sodium nitrite. Furthermore, 0.25 g/L polylysine or 0.15 g/L sodium nitrite did not significantly alter sei gene transcription, while 6 g/L chitosan obviously increased the relative mRNA level of sei gene expression. 0.4 g/L tea catechin remarkably inhibited sei gene transcription. In addition, 0.15 g/L sodium nitrite and 6 g/L chitosan significantly enhanced SEI secretion. 0.25 g/L polylysine, especially 0.4 g/L tea catechin, sharply inhibited the level of SEI secretion. The results indicated that tea catechin not only suppressed Staphylococcus aureus growth, but also inhibited SEI production and secretion, suggesting that tea catechin may be better than sodium nitrite, polylysine, or chitosan for keeping the food from the contamination of SEI. These investigations would be useful for food industry to provide safer food products due to S. aureus enterotoxins-related control strategy.

AB Small RNA represents several unique non-coding RNA classes that have important function in a wide range of biological processes including development of germ cells and early embryonic, cell differentiation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in diverse organisms. However, little is known about their expression profiles and effects in yak oocytes maturation and early development. To investigate the function of small RNAs in the maturation process of yak oocyte and early development, two small RNA libraries of oocytes were constructed from germinal vesicle stage (GV) and maturation in vitro to metaphase II-arrested stage (M II) and then sequenced using small RNA high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 9,742,592 and 12,168,523 clean reads were obtained from GV and M II oocytes, respectively. In total, 801 and 1,018 known miRNAs were acquired from GV and M II oocytes, and 75 miRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed: 47 miRNAs were upregulated and 28 miRNAs were downregulated in the M II oocytes compared to the GV stage. Among the upregulated miRNAs, miR-342 has the largest fold change (9.25-fold). Six highly expressed miRNAs (let-7i, miR-10b, miR-10c, miR-143, miR-146b and miR-148) were validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and consistent with the sequencing results. Furthermore, the expression patterns of two miRNAs and their potential targets were analysed in different developmental stages of oocytes and early embryos. This study provides the first miRNA profile in the mature process of yak oocyte. Seventy-five miRNAs are expressed differentially in GV and M II oocytes as well as among different development stages of early embryos, suggesting miRNAs involved in regulating oocyte maturation and early development of yak. These results showed specific miRNAs in yak oocytes had dynamic changes during meiosis. Further functional and mechanistic studies on the miRNAs during meiosis may beneficial to understanding the role of miRNAs on meiotic division.

AB G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important drug targets and generally activated by ligands. However, some experiments found that GPCRs also give rise to constitutive activity through some mutations (viz., CAM), which are usually associated with different kinds of diseases. However, the mechanisms of CAMs and their roles in interactions with drug-ligands are unclear in experiments. Herein, we used microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of one important F282L mutation on beta 2AR in order to address the questions above. With the aid of principle component and correlation analysis, our results revealed that the F282L mutation could increase the instability of the overall structure, increase the dramatic fluctuations of NPxxY and extracellular loops, and decrease restraint of the helices through weakening interhelical H-bonding and correlations between residues, which could partly contribute to the constitutive activity reported by the experiments. The observations from the protein structure network (PSN) analysis indicate that the mutant exhibits less information flow than the wild beta 2AR and weakens the role of TM5 and TM6 in the signal transmission, but it enhances the impact of TM3 on the orthosteric pathway and TM4 on the allosteric one. In addition, the results from the virtual screening reveal that the mutant prefers to select agonists rather than antagonists, similar to the active state but opposite of the inactive state, further confirming that the F282L mutation advances the activation of beta 2AR. Our observations provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of the mutation-caused constitutive activity of GPCR and related drug-design.

AB A series of reducible cationic lipids 4a-4f with different amino acid polar-head groups were prepared. The novel lipid contains a hydrophobic lipoic acid (LA) moiety, which can be reduced under reductive conditions to release of the encapsulated plasmid DNA. The particle size, zeta potential and cellular uptake of lipoplexes formed with DNA, as well as the transfection efficacy (TE) were characterized. The TE of the cationic lipid based on arginine was especially high, and was 2.5 times higher than that of a branched polyethylenimine in the presence of 10% serum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Elastic optical networks; Routing and spectrum assignment; Spectrum

ID ALLOCATION; DEFRAGMENTATION
AB Elastic optical networks (EONs) employ dynamic routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithms to support diverse services and heterogeneous requests. However, these RSA algorithms may possibly induce spectrum fragments when allocating spectrum to accommodate different service requests. Therefore, such induced spectrum fragments should also be regarded as spectrum consumption besides the allocated spectrum by RSA algorithms. In this paper, by additionally considering the holding times of lightpaths and service connections, we first introduce a comprehensive spectrum consumption model to simultaneously investigate both the allocated and the fragmented spectrum consumptions. Then we solve this model in both static and dynamic traffic scenarios, by either formulating the RSA problem with time-scheduled traffic or introducing a time-aware spectrum-efficient heuristics algorithm. Since no defragmentation is executed in spectrum allocation, the proposed RSA algorithm requires no traffic disruption and can be realized more easily in reality. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the comprehensive spectrum consumption and has lower bandwidth blocking probability than the typical first-fit RSA algorithm.

AB Flavonoids are the main components of Meconopsis integrifolia (Maxim.) Franch, which is a traditional Tibetan medicine. However, traditional chromatography separation requires a large quantity of raw M. integrifolia and is very time consuming. Herein, we applied highspeed counter-current chromatography in the separation and purification of flavonoids from the ethanol extracts of M. integrifolia flower. Ethyl acetate/n-butanol/water (2: 3: 5, v/v/v) was selected as the optimum solvent system to purify the four components, namely quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyrannosy-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 1, 60 mg), quercetin 3-O-[2'''-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 2, 40 mg), quercetin 3-O-[3'''-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 3, 11 mg), and quercetin 3-O-[6'''-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 -> 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (compound 4, 16 mg). Among the four compounds, 3 and 4 were new acetylated flavonol diglucosides. After the high-speed counter-current chromatography separation, the purities of the four flavonol diglucosides were 98, 95, 90, and 92%, respectively. The structures of these compounds were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

AB At present, a high-temperature steam requirement is the main problem in the recovery of furfural. In this work, D141 macroporous resin was selected to separate and enrich furfural from the hydrolysate, and ethanol was selected as the desorption reagent. The adsorption selectivity of furfural and acetic acid made it possible to obtain acetic acid simultaneously. Adsorption kinetics revealed that the rate was rapid and fitted by a pseudo-second-order model. Then the breakthrough curve and optimal operation conditions were systematically investigated. The optimized process of adsorption was a 3 bed volume (BV) solution loaded on the fixed bed of the D141 resin with a velocity of 1 BV/h, then eluted by 1 BV ethanol with a velocity of 1 BV/h. As a result, 96.97% of final recovery yield of furfural was obtained. Compared with the previous studies, the D141 macroporous resin was found to be more favorable for the adsorption of furfural in the hydrolysate.

AB A fast and sensitive HPLC coupled with multivariate analysis was utilized to assist the quality assessment of Gentianae macrophyllae radix (Qinjiao). Seventy-six peaks were separated and detected on a fused-core column with 35 min. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis of the chromatographic data showed that the 17 batches of Qinjiao could be well categorized into three groups, which were closely related to the origins of them. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) exhibited that the quality differentiation might be explained by at least four components, in which, gentiopicroside (GE), loganic acid (LA), swertiamarin (SA) were characterized by external reference, one of them was unidentified in this work. The content levels of GE, LA and SA were more relevant to comprehensive quality of Qinjiao than the ones of shanzhiside methyl ester and sweroside was confirmed by the PLS prediction models through analyzing the relevance of the chemical profiling to the levels of them. The present study not only indicated that GE, LA, SA and one unidentified compound were the rational markers to represent the comprehensive quality of Qinjiao but also demonstrated the power of chemical profiling platform in the quality assessment of Chinese medicine herbals.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation and maintenance. Additionally, it is becoming apparent that cyclooxygenase (COX) signaling is associated with canine mammary tumor development The goals of the present study were to investigate COX-2 expression patterns and their effect on CSC-mediated tumor initiation in primary canine mammary tissues and tumorsphere models using immunohistochemistry. Patterns of COX-2, CD44, octamer-binding transcription factor (Oct)-3/4, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression were examined in malignant mammary tumor (MMT) samples and analyzed in terms of clinicopathological characteristics. COX-2 and Oct-314 expression was higher in MMTs compared to other histological samples with heterogeneous patterns. In MMTs, COX-2 expression correlated with tumor malignancy features. Significant associations between COX-2, CD44, and EGFR were observed in low-differentiated MMTs. Comparative analysis showed that the levels of COX-2, CD44, and Oct-314 expression varied significantly among TSs of three histological grades. Enhanced COX-2 staining was consistently observed in TSs. Similar levels of staining intensity were found for CD44 and Oct-3/4, but EGFR expression was weak. Our findings indicate the potential role of COX-2 in CSC-mediated tumor initiation, and suggest that COX-2 inhibition may help treat canine mammary tumors by targeting CSCs.

AB Effective maintenance decision-making depends on information obtained by analysing system operating data. In this paper, we present a method to measure the daily, weekly, monthly and long-term performance of the corrective repair and preventive maintenance by analysing the operating data. Operating data from a bus fleet, served successively in two routes, were observed for over 6 years. The proportional intensity model is used to evaluate the environment effects, which include temperature, humidity and rainfall. Two composite models are proposed to analyse the interplay of events, which include repair/maintenance arrival/finished time, cost, repair/maintenance number and time between failures. A maintenance performance scorecard is developed to present a snapshot of the bus fleet maintenance performance, which can assist maintenance planning and management.

SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for next-generation high-energy-density batteries but suffer from severe interface instability on reactive Li metal, resulting in poor cycling performance and resource inefficiency. In this study, we present a durable artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (composed of organic conjugated polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) and uniformly dispersed inorganic ZnO nanoparticles, denoted as CPAN@ZnO) using an eco-friendly approach, with reduced energy consumption and minimized thermal degradation byproducts. The unique conjugated structure of CPAN exhibits homogeneous surface electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution. When coupled with lithiophilic ZnO, this interaction induces more homogeneous Li deposition and inhibits dendrite growth. Additionally, its great binding energy with Li and rapid ion migration pathways effectively promote the de-solvation of Li+ and enhance interfacial transport kinetics. Therefore, the CPAN@ZnO SEI exhibits high ionic conductivity, suppressing "dead Li" and dendrite, thus enhancing interface stability and extending the Li anode lifespan. As a result, the CPAN@ZnO@Li symmetrical cell achieves an ultralong cycling life of over 5400 h with a low overpotential, showcasing exceptional cycling stability. Furthermore, the Li-limited full cell NCM811||CPAN@ZnO@Cu (N/P = 0.6) delivers stable cycling over 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 88.8%. This work provides valuable insights into high ionic conductivity SEI design for stable cycling performance of Li-limited LMBs, reducing reliance on anode mining and mitigating environmental impacts from electrode material production, thereby contributing to resource sustainability.

AB As urban spaces expand, changes in land use significantly affect the structure and function of urban ecosystems, particularly with challenges such as green space reduction and uneven distribution. This study focused on the central urban area of Chengdu, China, simulating and forecasting various urban development scenarios for 2035, including cultivated land protection (CP), economic development (ED), ecological priority (EP), and natural development (ND). The construction of green space ecological networks followed a systematic process, incorporating key methods such as ecological source identification, landscape resistance surface construction, and ecological corridor extraction. The connectivity of these ecological networks was assessed using the space syntax. The results indicated that: (1) Construction land expanded across all scenarios, with the ED scenario having the largest area, while the EP scenario resulted in a significant increase in green space. (2) Ecological corridors were established under every scenario, with the EP scenario featuring the most extensive and well-connected network, linking urban green patches with surrounding natural areas. (3) The EP scenario's ecological network displayed integration, choice, connectivity, and depth values that indicate the most complete and stable network structure. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of green space ecological network changes under different urban development strategies, offering valuable insights for optimizing urban green space planning and management.

AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) employs reactive oxygen species (ROS) from a photosensitizer (PS) under light, inhibiting multi-drug resistance in bacteria. However, hypoxic conditions in infection sites and biofilms challenge PDT efficiency. We developed fluorinated small molecular micelles (PF-CBMs) as PS carriers to address this, relieving hypoxia and enhancing PS penetration into biofilms. Perfluorocarbons in PF-CBMs transport more oxygen due to their excellent oxygen-dissolving capability. Fluorination enhances loading capacity and serum stability, reduces premature release, and improves cellular uptake, to improve PDT efficacy. PF-CBMs, with acid- induced surface charge transformation, exhibit superior biofilm penetration, resulting in increased antibiofilm activity of PDT. Compared to fluorine-free micelles (PC-CBMs), PF-CBMs demonstrate better serum stability, higher drug loading, and reduced premature release, leading to significantly improved antibacterial efficacy in vitro and in vivo. . In conclusion, fluorinated micelles with surface charge reversal enhance PDT for antibacterial and antibiofilm applications.

AB Naturally derived compounds show promise as treatments for microbial infections. Polyphenols, abundantly found in various plants, fruits, and vegetables, are noted for their physiological benefits including antimicrobial effects. This study introduced a new set of acylated phloroglucinol derivatives, synthesized and tested for their antifungal activity in vitro against seven different pathogenic fungi. The standout compound, 3-methyl-1-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl) butan-1-one (2b), exhibited remarkable fungicidal strength, with EC50 values of 1.39 mu g/mL against Botrytis cinerea and 1.18 mu g/mL against Monilinia fructicola, outperforming previously screened phenolic compounds. When tested in vivo, 2b demonstrated effective antifungal properties, with cure rates of 76.26% for brown rot and 83.35% for gray mold at a concentration of 200 mu g/mL, rivaling the commercial fungicide Pyrimethanil in its efficacy against B. cinerea. Preliminary research suggests that 2b's antifungal mechanism may involve the disruption of spore germination, damage to the fungal cell membrane, and leakage of cellular contents. These results indicate that compound 2b has excellent fungicidal properties against B. cinerea and holds potential as a treatment for gray mold.

AB Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) is a form of vitamin K2 2 with health-beneficial effects. A novel fermentation strategy based on combining soy protein hydrolysates (SPHs) with biofilm-based fermentation was investigated to enhance menaquinone-7 (MK-7) biosynthesis by Bacillus subtilis natto. . Results showed the SPHs increased MK-7 yield by 199.4% in two-stage aeration fermentation as compared to the SP-based medium in submerged fermentation, which was related to the formation of robust biofilm with wrinkles and the enhancement of cell viability. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between key genes related to MK-7 and biofilm synthesis, and the quorum sensing (QS) related genes, Spo0A and SinR, , were downregulated by 0.64-fold and 0.39-fold respectively, which promoted biofilm matrix synthesis. Meanwhile, SPHs also enhanced the MK-7 precursor, isoprene side chain, supply, and MK-7 assembly efficiency. Improved fermentation performances of bacterial cells during fermentation were attributed to abundant oligopeptides (Mw < 1 kDa) and moderate amino acids, particularly Arg, Asp, and Phe in SPHs. All these results revealed that SPHs were a potential and superior nitrogen source for MK-7 production by Bacillus subtilis natto. .

AB When zero-valent iron (ZVI) is prepared and applied under neutral conditions, it is easy to form oxides or hydroxides on its surface, which hinders the electron release of ZVI. To this end, a nucleophile was introduced into the ZVI system to inhibit the precipitation of iron ions, improve the conductivity of the solution, and promote the removal efficiency of electrophilic functional groups in organic compounds. In this study, the addition of nucleophiles such as ethylenediamine, methylamine and dimethylamine to the ZVI/H2O2 2 O 2 system resulted in an enhanced removal efficiency of tetracycline (TC) under neutral condition, while electrophiles such as EDTA-2Na and oxalic acid dihydrate impeded the removal of TC. Experimental results demonstrated that the presence of nucleophiles could effectively promote the release of iron ions and increase the proportion of ferrous in both aqueous solution and solid surface of ZVI. Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the electrophilic functional group was eliminated in the TC molecule, and the toxicity of the treated solution was reduced significantly. Overall, this work provides a selection of the conditions and pollutants applicable to ZVI under neutral pH conditions.

AB The pretreatment method of fruit before fermentation is a crucial step in fruit wine production, exerting a considerable influence on its overall quality, particularly on sensory characteristics and flavor profile. In this study, Pujiang kiwifruits as raw material, four pretreatment methods were employed in kiwi wine (KW) production, namely kiwi fruit crushing with peel (KCP), crushing without peel (KCW), kiwi fruit squeezing juice with peel (KJP), and squeezing juice without peel (KJW). The sensory characteristics and flavor profile of KW were evaluated using sensory evaluation, E -tongue, GC-IMS, and 1H NMR. KW produced through KCP method achieved the highest sensory evaluation score, compared to the others. E -tongue could effectively differentiate the taste features among KW produced by different pretreatment methods. A total of 137 compounds were characterized by the combination of GC-IMS and 1H NMR. Moreover, among the molecules quantified by GC-IMS and 1H NMR, the concentrations of 52 and 58 compounds, respectively, exhibited significant differences among the four groups, primarily comprising esters, organic acids and alcohols. Furthermore, enrichment analysis indicated that several metabolic pathways could be altered by different pretreatment methods. This study serves as a theoretical reference and application basis for the quality improvement of KW and offers insights on the reduction and utilization of winemaking by-products.

Herein, porous carbons are rationally designed for tunable nanopore structures (micropores, 4.12 % similar to 91.64 %) and diverse spatial confinement ability, as indicated by their differential enhancement performances in the Fenton oxidation. Porous carbons can alter the characteristics of the charge transport process for accelerating sustainable electron shuttle between hydrogen peroxide and iron species, and thus exhibit long-term performance (17 cycling tests). The positive spatial confinement for boosting Fenton oxidation (charge transport, mass transfer) occurs in nanochannels < 1 nm, while the diminished effect ranges of 1-1.5 nm, and the adverse effect ranges greater than 1.5 nm. The density functional theory calculation provides further support for certifying the promoted charge transport process and spatial confinement for hydroxyl radical inside the confined nanochannel structure (below 1 nm, especially) by the comparatively large electron cloud and the relatively negative adsorption energy, respectively. Coupling nanochannels with the Fenton oxidation greatly utilize hydrogen peroxide, due to spatial nanoconfinement and selective adsorption towards target contaminants. This strategy of deploying nanochannels in catalyst design can be applied for the elaborate construction of efficient nanostructured catalysts for environmental remediation.

AB Mastitis is commonly recognized as a localized inflammatory udder disease induced by the infiltration of exogenous pathogens. In the present study, our objective was to discern fecal and milk variations in both microbiota composition and metabolite profiles among three distinct groups of cows: healthy cows, cows with subclinical mastitis and cows with clinical mastitis. The fecal microbial community of cows with clinical mastitis was significantly less rich and diverse than the one harbored by healthy cows. In parallel, mastitis caused a strong disturbance in milk microbiota. Metabolomic profiles showed that eleven and twenty-eight molecules exhibited significant differences among the three groups in feces and milk, respectively. Similarly, to microbiota profile, milk metabolome was affected by mastitis more extensively than fecal metabolome, with particular reference to amino acids and sugars. Pathway analysis revealed that amino acids metabolism and energy metabolism could be considered as the main pathways altered by mastitis. These findings underscore the notable distinctions of fecal and milk samples among groups, from microbiome and metabolomic points of view. This observation stands to enhance our comprehension of mastitis in dairy cows.

AB Kiwi wine (KW) is tipically made by fermenting juice from peeled kiwifruit, resulting in the disposal of peel and pomace as by-products. However, the peel contains various beneficial compounds, like phenols and flavonoids. Since the peel is edible and rich in these compounds, incorporating it into the fermentation process of KW presents a potential solution to minimize by-product waste. This study compared the aroma and taste profiles of KW from peeled (PKW) and unpeeled (UKW) kiwifruits by combining intelligent sensory technology, GC-MS, and 1H-NMR. Focusing on aroma profiles, 75 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified in KW fermented with peel, and 73 VOCs in KW without peel, with 62 VOCs common to both. Among these compounds, rose oxide, D-citronellol, and bornylene were more abundant in UKW, while hexyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, and 2,4,5-trichlorobenzene were significantly higher in PKW. For taste profiles, E-tongue analysis revealed differences in the taste profiles of KW from the two sources. A total of 74 molecules were characterized using 1H-NMR. UKW exhibited significantly higher levels of tartrate, galactarate, N-acetylserotonin, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelate, fumarate, and N-acetylglycine, along with a significantly lower level of oxypurinol compared to PKW. This study seeks to develop the theoretical understanding of the fermentation of kiwifruit with peel in sight of the utilization of the whole fruit for KW production, to increase the economic value of kiwifruit production.

AB Peanut isolated protein (PIP), peanut arachin (ARA), and peanut lipophilic protein (PLP) were obtained from peanut defatted powder (PDP) by the isoelectric point precipitation method. and their chemical, structural, and functional properties were evaluated. Chloroform-methanol method disclosed that PLP contained largest amount of lipids (10.98 +/- 0.34%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction detected that the four proteins had similar spectrum charateristics. However, PLP displayed the highest contents of alpha-helix and beta-sheet indicating a more compact tertiary structure accompanied by significantly highest solubility, emulsifiability, and emulsion stability compared to other three protein components ( P < 0.05). Both the water holding capacity and fat holding capacity of PLP were higher, but its gel forming capacity and gel stability were lower compared to ARA. Composition analysis demonstrated that PLP had similar amino acid pattern to that of PIP, and each 100g of PLP contained 7.24g unsaturated fatty acid which composed of 17 fatty acids. These results suggested that PLP was a lipid-rich protein in peanut which could be a potential functional ingredient in the food industry.

AB The scarcity of fresh water necessitates sustainable and efficient water desalination strategies. Solar-driven steam generation (SSG), which employs solar energy for water evaporation, has emerged as a promising approach. Graphene oxide (GO)-based membranes possess advantages like capillary action and Marangoni effect, but their stacking defects and dead zones of flexible flakes hinders efficient water transportation, thus the evaporation rate lag behind unobstructed-porous 3D evaporators. Therefore, fundamental mass-transfer approach for optimizing SSG evaporators offers new horizons. Herein, a universal multi-force-fields-based method is presented to regularize membrane channels, which can mechanically eliminate inherent interlayer stackings and defects. Both characterization and simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across different scales and explain the intrinsic mechanism of mass-transfer enhancement. When combined with a structurally optimized substrate, the 4Laponite@GO-1 achieves evaporation rate of 2.782 kg m-2 h-1 with 94.48% evaporation efficiency, which is comparable with most 3D evaporators. Moreover, the optimized membrane exhibits excellent cycling stability (10 days) and tolerance to extreme conditions (pH 1-14, salinity 1%-15%), verifies the robust structural stability of regularized channels. This optimization strategy provides simple but efficient way to enhance the SSG performance of GO-based membranes, facilitating their extensive application in sustainable water purification technologies.
   The regularization strategy: within the multi-force hybrid system under high-speed spin process, laponite nanosheets are employed to achieve fine-tuning of the interlayer mass-transfer channels inside the composite membrane. image

AB Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have unique structure and fantastic properties for wide-ranging applications. Pilot studies highlighted the toxicity and potential threats of MOF materials to the environment. In this study, we revealed the phytotoxicity of MOF-74(Co) nanoparticles (NPs) and their inhibitory effects on the photosynthesis of pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L.). MOF-74(Co) NPs have limited influences on the germination of pea seeds, but distinct environmental effects of MOF-74(Co) NPs were found in pea seedlings. The root length of pea seedlings, fresh weight and dry weight decreased by 50.0%, 29.2% and 36.4%, respectively, compared with the control group, when the material concentration was greater than 100 mg L-1. The net photosynthetic rate decreased by 48% and the intercellular CO2 concentration increased by 183% upon exposure to MOF-74(Co) NPs. Mechanistically, MOF-74(Co) exposure led to Co uptake in pea seedlings; the increases were 223% for the root, 267% for the stem and 6562% for the leaves, respectively, when the MOF-74(Co) NP concentration was 10 mg L-1. The released Co ions from MOF-74(Co) NPs caused oxidative damage to leaves and induced damage to the acceptor side of photosynthesis system II. Our results indicated that the environmental toxicity of MOF materials was largely regulated by the metal centers. MOF materials with nontoxic metal elements are desirable for future applications.
   MOF-74(Co) NPs lower root length, fresh weight and dry weight of pea seedlings. MOF-74(Co) NPs decreased net photosynthetic rate and increased intercellular CO2 content. Released Co ions induced oxidative stress and damaged photosynthesis system II.

AB Predators may adapt to global warming via behavioural plasticity. However, empirical evidence showing such adaptations in terrestrial ecosystems is scarce. Here we report behavioural shifts that alter the web mesh size of two dominant predatory spider species in response to experimental warming in an alpine meadow field. Experimental large open-top chambers increased the mean annual air temperature by 0.6 degrees C, resulting in a decrease in the web mesh size of the large spider (-43.6%), and an increase in the web mesh size of the small spider (+79.8%). Structural equation models indicated that the changes in mesh size and web area were primarily the result of warming-induced changes in prey size spectra, which in turn were impacted by warming-induced changes in soil moisture and plant community. These results indicate that predators can adjust their behavioural responses to warming-induced changes in the physical setting and prey community.
   The authors show shifts in predatory spider web mesh size under experimental warming in an alpine meadow. Web mesh size decreased for a large spider species, but increased for a small species, with changes linked to altered prey size spectra following soil moisture and plant community shifts.

AB In this work, a novel nanoparticle ((MoS2-BT)@ (PDA+PEI)) was constructed through two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and zero-dimensional barium titanate (BT) via in-situ polymerization and co-modification of polydopamine (PDA) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Then the nanofillers were dispersed in the Polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) matrix by film casting to obtain PEN/(MoS2-BT)@ (PDA+PEI) nanocomposite dielectric films. Subsequently, the latter were subjected to chemical crosslinking at high temperature to obtain CPEN/(MoS2-BT)@ (PDA+PEI) nanocomposites. The effects of filler content on the properties of PEN matrix composite films were investigated. The results indicate excellent compatibility between (MoS2-BT)@ (PDA+PEI) and the PEN matrix due to the introduction of an organic modification layer, resulting in overall good performance of nanocomposite films, including good thermal stability with a glass transition temperature (T-g) exceeding 240 degree celsius after chemical crosslinking. The dielectric constant of CPEN nanocomposites containing 40 wt% of the hybrid nanoparticles is 20.2 and the dielectric loss is 0.032 at 1 kHz, the dielectric constant-temperature coefficient of all CPEN nanocomposites is less than 6 x 10(-4) degree celsius(-1) at the temperature range of 25-220 degree celsius. In short, the incorporation of (MoS2-BT)@ (PDA+PEI) effectively enhances the thermal, mechanical, and dielectric properties of PEN-based nanocomposites.

ID EFFICIENCY
AB A high-efficiency power-combining method for four-way 5.8-GHz magnetrons based on the external injection-locking technique is presented in this article. The method uses a nonisolated, lossless five-port hybrid waveguide combiner for power combining. Meanwhile, the injection-locking technology has been applied to magnetrons for achieving coherent power combining. The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly +/- 2.5 (degrees) . In contrast, when a phase-locked loop was introduced, the phase fluctuation reduced significantly to approximately +/- 0.5 (degrees) . This phase accuracy can fully meet the requirements of combining experiments. Four magnetrons worked in injection-locked states without phase-locked loop. The proposed power-combining system is designed, measured, and analyzed. Measurement results show that a high-power-combining efficiency of over 95% is achieved by injection-locked magnetron without PLL, with the best efficiency reaching up to 97.7% with phase control of the injected signals. Experimental results reveal that the magnetron phase-pushing effects and the ripple in high-power dc voltage and current have a minor impact of approximately 4% on the combining efficiency.

AB The conjugation of chitopentaose (CHP) on beta-lactoglobulin (beta Lg) via Maillard reaction was used to desensitize beta Lg. The stable beta Lg-CHP conjugate (beta C-4) was formed at 4 h incubation, which contains 5 CHP attached molecules and a conjugated degree of 42 %. The conjugation promoted the thermal stability and emulsifying properties of beta Lg, and inhibited the immunoglobulin E (IgE) combining capacity by decreasing the content of beta-sheet in beta Lg. Moreover, beta Lg-CHP conjugates were imparted with anti-oxidant properties and anti-inflammatory activities. Further, the combined action of inhibited IgE combining capacity and anti-inflammatory activities improved the allergy desensitization in beta Lg sensitized mice. The results showed that overexpressed IgE and inflammatory factors, unbalanced Th1-/Th2- immune cytokines were significantly attenuated after beta Lg was conjugated with CHP, avoiding the inflammatory lesions in spleen and colon. Additionally, the adverse changes in gut microbiota were alleviated in beta C-4 group with a decrease of Bacteroidetes and increase of Firmicutes at phylum level and the probiotic bacteria of Lactobacillaceae was significantly improved at the family level. Thus, the conjugation of CHP can desensitize allergic reaction caused by beta Lg.

AB Arabinoxylan derived from brewers' spent grain was carboxymethylated, and the emulsifying capacity of car-boxymethylated arabinoxylans (CMAX) with different degrees of substitution (DS) was investigated. Results showed that carboxymethylation greatly enhanced the emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability of CMAX compared to the initial arabinoxylan. CMAX developed decreased zeta-potential, higher hydrophilicity, and improved interfacial adsorption capacity. Consequently, the denser and stronger interface on the oil droplet was formed, and the stabilizing mechanism was altered. Moreover, CMAX with lower DS could effectively stabilize emulsions during storage at a concentration of 0.5 % and pH between 6 and 7. Higher DS, however, led to poorer emulsion stability and greater flocculation as a result of the fragile interface formed by excess intermolecular ionic force. The research found CMAX potential in emulsion stabilizing and further applications in food processing.

DT Article
ID CARBOHYDRATE; FABRICATION
AB Glucose detection plays a crucial role in the treatment and management of diabetes. We herein report a simple strategy to prepare a photonic crystal hydrogel (PNAPB PCH) sensor for colorimetric detection of glucose. This sensor is composed of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-3-acrylamidophenyl boronic acid) smart hydrogel with pendent phenylboronic acid (PBA) units and embedded Fe3O4 colloidal photonic crystals (PCs), which could strongly diffract visible light and endow the hydrogel with brilliant structural colors. The PBA units could form complexes with glucose molecules, thus increasing the ionization degree of the hydrogel and expanding its volume. The volume swelling increased the adjacent distance of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) and thereby red-shifted their diffraction wavelength. As a result, the glucose signal could be facilely converted into a color change of the hydrogel. The resultant PNAPB PCH biosensor displayed high sensitivity and selectivity to glucose as well as excellent thermosensitive detection performances. In addition, by taking advantage of the unique thermosensitivity of the introduced PNIPAM moieties on the gel network, the glucose-responded PNAPB PCH sensor could be easily regenerated via simple alternate flushing using hot/cold water without compromising its performance. Such a glucose-sensitive PCH sensor possessing the obvious advantages of portability, ease of operation, and cost-effectiveness makes it valuable for daily blood glucose monitoring and diabetes diagnosis.
   A phenylboronic acid-based smart photonic crystal hydrogel (PNAPB) sensor with good recyclability was reported for the sensitive and colorimetric detection of glucose.

AB Aims: Sleep deprivation (SD) has become a health problem in modern society due to its adverse effects on different aspects. However, the relationship between sleep and cardiovascular system function remains unclear. Here we explored the changes occurring in the brain and the heart sounds after SD. Methods: Ninety healthy adult men were recruited and subjected to 36 h of Sleep Deprivation (SD). They participated in a number of tests, including measurements of the heart sound, blood oxygen, and heart rate every 2 h. By using of principal component analysis to reduced the dimensionality of heart sound data. While the ALFF and ReHo indexes were measured via fMRI before and after SD. Correlation and regression analyses were used to reveal the relationship between fMRI and heart sound changes due to SD. Results: In this study, there were no abnormal values in the heart rate and blood oxygen during 36 h of SD, whereas the intensity of heart sounds fluctuated significantly increased and decreased. The ALFF was increased in bilateral pericalcarine(Calcarine), left anterior cuneus, (Precuneus_L), right superior temporal gyrus(Temporal_Sup_R), left supplementary motor area (Supp_Motor_Area_L); However, it was reduced in the right medial superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_Medial_R), right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (Frontal_Sup_R) and left medial frontal gyrus (Frontal_Mid_L). The regression analysis uncovered that the intensity of the heart sound in the systole, s1, and s2 phase could be explained by Calcarine_L changes. Conclusion: Acute sleep deprivation affects cardiac-brain axis and the specific brain regions. Calcarine_L changes during sleep deprivation are involved in regulating heart contractions.

AB The regulatory mechanisms and functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in yak intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate yak circRNAs with high and low IMF content using high-throughput sequencing. A total of 270 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, of which 129 were upregulated and 141 were downregulated. Among these circRNAs, circCWC22, derived from the yak CWC22 gene, was further studied to understand its functions and regulatory mechanisms. Sequencing and RNase R processing confirmed the circular nature of circCWC22. By constructing a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression network, the potential regulatory pathway of circCWC22/miR-3059-x/HMGCL was identified. To investigate the roles of circCWC22, miR-3059-x, and HMGCL in the deposition of yak intramuscular preadipocytes (YIMAs), CCK-8, EdU, BODIPY, triglyceride content, and qRT-PCR analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that circCWC22, miR-3059-x, and HMGCL promoted the differentiation and inhibited the proliferation of YIMAs. Using the dual-luciferase reporter system and qRT-PCR, we confirmed that circCWC22 adsorbed miR-3059-x, and HMGCL was identified as a target gene of miR-3059-x. In conclusion, this study uncovered a large number of potential circRNAs involved in IMF deposition and highlighted the significant role of circCWC22 in yak IMF deposition via the circCWC22/miR-3059-x/HMGCL axis.

AB Confronting the pressing challenge of freshwater scarcity, polymeric membrane-based water treatment technology has emerged as an essential and effective approach. Poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) polymers, a class of high-performance engineering thermoplastics, have garnered attention in recent decades as promising membrane materials for advanced water treatment approaches. The PAE-Based membranes are employed to resist the shortages of most common polymeric membranes, such as chemical instability, structural damage, membrane fouling, and shortened lifespan when deployed in harsh environments, owing to their excellent comprehensive performance. This article presents the advancements in the research of several typical PAEs, including poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), polyethersulfone (PES), and poly(arylene ether nitrile) (PEN). Techniques for membrane formation, modification strategies, and applications in water treatment have been reviewed. The applications encompass processes for oil/water separation, desalination, and wastewater treatment, which involve the removal of heavy metal ions, dyes, oils, and other organic pollutants. The commendable performance of these membranes has been summarized in terms of corrosion resistance, high-temperature resistance, anti-fouling properties, and durability in challenging environments. In addition, several recommendations for further research aimed at developing efficient and robust PAE-based membranes are proposed.

AB BackgroundOverwhelming Fe accumulation in tumor arouses strong oxidative stress. To benefit the cancer patients, Fe(II) delivered by carbon nanoparticles-Fe(II) complex (CNSI-Fe) should be visualized to ensure the successful intratumoral injection and the antitumor mechanisms should be investigated at molecular level.ResultsIntracellular Fe accumulations associating with the uptakes of CNSI-Fe were observed both in vitro and in vivo. The retention of Fe(II) in tumor over 72 h was visualized by magnetic resonance imaging. CNSI-Fe inhibited the tumor growth and expanded the lifespan of colonic tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor activity of CNSI-Fe was attributed to the increases of OH radicals and the oxidative stress in tumor cells, which resulted in cell apoptosis and ferroptosis. The transcriptome analyses confirmed the changes of ferroptosis and inflammation signaling pathways by CNSI-Fe treatment. The low toxicity of CNSI-Fe was indicated by the serum biochemistry, hematology, and histopathology.ConclusionCNSI-Fe induced the efficient apoptosis and ferroptosis of colonic tumor for cancer therapy. Our results would benefit the clinical applications of CNSI-Fe and stimulate great interest in the nanomedicine.

AB Semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene is an essential process in the expanding polystyrene industry. Despite Pd-based catalysts have been widely used, challenges like styrene over-hydrogenation and high cost remain to be addressed. Herein, a Pd-doped Ni nanocatalyst (Pd-0.1/Ni-1/Al2O3) with excellent Pd utilization was successfully developed for semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, delivering a high conversion of >99 % with 95 % selectivity to styrene at ambient temperature and pressure (25 degrees C, 1 atm H-2). The boosted catalytic activity might be ascribed to the mesoporous Al2O3 with large surface area, and the enhanced selectivity is due to the reduced electron density and improved dispersion of Pd derived from Ni-Pd interaction. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits excellent stability for enduring 6 cycles. This work provides an efficient and practical strategy to develop cost-effective, high-performance and recyclable catalysts for various selective hydrogenation reactions in fundamental and applied research.

AB Unconventional animal feeds present distinct features and considerable variations. However, their efficacy in monogastric animals is hindered by high levels of anti-nutritional elements and subpar palatability. Feed fermentation could offer a solution to these issues. Moreover, fermented unconventional feeds deliver notable economic advantages and represent a viable alternative to antibiotic growth promoters, particularly in the context of antibiotic restrictions, promising considerable potential. This review provides an in-depth exploration of the types, characteristics, fermentation processes, application outcomes, associated challenges, and prospects of fermented unconventional feeds in monogastric animals. We anticipate that this comprehensive overview will serve as a valuable reference for developing and utilizing unconventional feed resources in the feed industry.

AB Sodium niobate (NN) lead-free perovskites have been concentrated on due to high performance and abundant phase structure. The complex structure evolution has become a hot topic of research for this kind of materials. In this work, antiferroelectric phase is recovered by introducing La3+ dopant from modified ferroelectric states, indicating reversible composition-induced antiferroelectric-ferroelectric (AFE-FE) phase transition in NN-based ceramics. Significantly, change tendency of decreasing first and then increasing appears for phase transition temperature with increasing La3+, which is different from general phenomenon for ions dopant. Antiferroelectric orthorhombic (Pbma) is induced from ferroelectric tetragonal (P4mm) with a transient state of paraelectric cubic (Pm3m) via enhancing La3+. Further, substitution on A-site and A/B-sites are revealed with low and high content of La3+, respectively, accompanied by decreased first and then increased oxygen vacancy. Moreover, obviously deteriorated piezoelectric response is observed along with poor domain switching due to the vanishing ferro-electric domain for FE-PE-AFE phase transition. Meanwhile, weak strain, piezoelectric and dielectric properties are observed for antiferroelectric phase with antiparallel dipoles, while enhanced strain and dielectric permit-tivity are gained around ferroelectric-paraelectric coexistence or paraelectric region originating from electric field-induced ferroelectric state from polar nanoregions. Thus, this work demonstrated an abnormal phase transition in NN-based ceramics, promoting the understanding of antiferroelectrics.

AB This study fills a gap created by previous environmental investigations by including the impact of agricultural employment and technology on the load capacity factor (LCF) rather than solely focusing on CO2 or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which only measure from the demand side; LCF provides a complete picture of environmental degradation by evaluating both the demand side and supply side. This connection is moderated further by considering the renewable energy and natural resource rent impacts. In this analysis, panel econometric methods are incorporated, including the cross-sectional dependence test. This study uses the Pooled Mean Group-Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PMG-ARDL) model to evaluate the level of effect independent factors had on the LCF of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) nations from 1992 to 2020 in the presence of a heterogeneous integration order. The estimations recognize heterogeneity in the effects of agricultural employment, renewable energy, natural resource rent, and technology on LCF, in the short run and long run. According to the empirical results, agricultural employment significantly enhances the LCF both in the short run and long run, implying that employment in agriculture improves environmental sustainability. However, increasing the use of renewable energy protects the environment from degradation only in the long run; it has no significant impact in the short run. On the contrary, natural resource rent and technology lead to a decline in environmental sustainability in the long run. Hence, this study recommends prioritizing renewable energy intake over other energies, providing proper incentives to motivate agricultural entrepreneurship to ensure a sustainable environment.

AB The yak (Bos grunniens) is a unique breed living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its surrounding areas, providing locals with a variety of vital means of living and production. However, the yak has poor sexual maturity and low fertility. High-quality mature oocytes are the basis of animal breeding technology. Recently, in vitro culturing of oocytes and embryo engineering technology have been applied to yak breeding. However, compared to those observed in vivo, the maturation rate and developmental capacity of in vitro oocytes are still low, which severely limits the application of in vitro fertilization and embryo production in yaks. This review summarizes the endogenous and exogenous factors affecting the in vitro maturation (IVM) and developmental ability of yak oocytes reported in recent years and provides a theoretical basis for obtaining high-quality oocytes for in vitro fertilization and embryo production in yaks.

AB Miniaturization of microplasma-based optical emission spectrometry (OES) has gained great attention due to the advantages of simplicity, compactness, and cost-effectiveness. However, the energy feed-in affects the genera-tion, maintenance and excitation capability of discharge microplasma, which also limits the potential of microplasma for portable OES. Herein, we report that a piezoelectric transformer-driven microplasma (PTM) was first utilized as an excitation source of miniature OES for quantitative analysis of mercury (Hg). A piezoelectric transformer (PT) can directly convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and emanate plasma at the wire of the output distal end, which provides a path to construct microplasma devices without an extra high voltage power supply. A syringe needle acted as another ungrounded electrode, which was hung a proper distance below the PT output, to generate glow discharge. Hg was effectively converted into volatile species by hydride gen-eration (HG) and transferred into PTM through the syringe needle by carrier gas (argon). Under the optimized experimental conditions, Hg was detected in the range of 10-1000 & mu;g/L, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.8 & mu;g/L by using the analytical line of Hg 253.65 nm. The accuracy and practicability of the proposed method were validated by analyzing the Certified Reference Materials (CRMs, dogfish liver and soil) and real water samples with satisfied results. In addition to no need of high voltage power supply and closed circuit, this HG-PTM-OES system features low power consumption, small size, light weight, sturdiness and high safety, which would be beneficial to fabricate a miniaturized and portable device for on-site environmental monitoring.

AB Although low Honesty-Humility is associated with unethical behavior, few studies have examined this relation from the longitudinal perspective across late adolescence. The present study investigated the longitudinal relation between Honesty-Humility and unethical behavior, including whether moral disengagement served as a mediator of this relation at both the between-and within-person levels by using a three-wave data of 1,646 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 15.22). The results revealed that (1) Honesty-Humility and unethical behavior bidirectionally predicted each other at both levels; (2) Honesty-Humility indirectly predicted unethical behavior via moral disengagement at the between-person level but not at the within-person level, and Honesty-Humility indirectly predicted moral disengagement via unethical behavior at both levels. Honesty-Humility and unethical behavior are indeed developmentally and dynamically intertwined.

AB Herein, a novel triple-layered heterojunction catalytic cathode membrane (PVDF/rGO/TFe/MnO2, TMOHccm) was reported and applied in seawater electro membrane reactor assisted electrolytic cell system (SEMR-EC), achieving increased properties for cyanide wastewater treatment. Hydrophilic TMOHccm exhibits higher electrochemical activity (qT* 1.11 C cm-2, qo* 0.03 C cm-2), indicating excellent electron transfer efficiency. Further analysis shows a one-electron redox cycle of exposed transition metal oxides (TMOs) on rGO support mediated oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, and calculated results of density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates positive Bader charge (72 |e|) of synthesized catalyst. The developed SEMR-EC was implemented in intermittentstream operation for treating cyanide wastewater, the system achieved optimized decyanation and carbon removal performance (CN- 100%, TOC 88.49%). Hyperoxidation active species produced SEMR-EC including hydroxyl, sulfate, and reactive chlorine species (RCS) was confirmed. The proposed mechanistic explanation indicated multiple removal pathways relevant to cyanide, organic matter, and iron were elucidated, and the engineering applications prospects were highlighted by cost (5.61 $) and benefit (Ce 399.26 mW m-2 $-1, EFe 248.11 g kWh-1) analysis of the system.

AB Menaquinone-7 is a form of vitamin K-2 that has been shown to have numerous healthy benefits. In this study, several surfactants were investigated to enhance the production of menaquinone-7 in Bacillus natto. Results showed that Brij-58 supplementation influenced the cell membrane via adsorption, and changed the interfacial tension of fermentation broth, while the changes in the state and the composition of the cell membrane enhanced the secretion and biosynthesis of menaquinone-7. The total production and secretion rate of menaquinone-7 increased by 48.0% and 56.2% respectively. During fermentation, the integrity of the cell membrane decreased by 82.9% while the permeability increased by 158% when the maximum secretory rate was reached. Furthermore, Brij-58 supplementation induced the stress response in bacteria, resulting in hyperpolarization of the membrane, and increased membrane ATPase activity. Finally, changes in fatty acid composition increased membrane fluidity by 30.1%. This study provided an effective strategy to enhance menaquinone-7 yield in Bacillus natto and revealed the mechanism of Brij-58 supplementation in menaquinone-7 production.

AB Background and objectives: Arrhythmia classification based on electrocardiograms (ECG) can enhance clin-ical diagnostic efficiency. However, due to the significant differences in the number of different categories of heartbeats, the performance of classes with fewer samples in arrhythmia classification have not met expectations under the inter-patient paradigm. This paper aims to mitigate the adverse effects of category imbalance and improve arrhythmia classification performance.Methods: We constructed a novel dual attention hybrid network (DA-Net) for arrhythmia classification under sample imbalance, based on modified convolutional networks with channel attention (MCC-Net) and sequence-to-sequence network with global attention (Seq2Seq). The refined local features of the in-put heartbeat are first extracted by MCC-Net and then sent to Seq2Seq for further feature fusion. By applying local and global attention in the feature extraction and fusion parts, respectively, the method fully fuses low-level feature details and high-level context information and enhances the ability to ex-tract discriminative features.Results: Based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, under the inter-patient paradigm without any data augmentation methods, the proposed method achieved 99.98% accuracy (ACC) for five categories. The various performance indicators are as follows: Class N: sensitivity (SEN) = 99.96%, specificity (SPEC) = 99.93%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 99.99%; Class S: SEN = 99.67%, SPEC = 99.98%, PPV = 99.56%; Class V: SEN = 100%, SPEC = 99.99%, PPV = 99.91%; Class F: SEN = 100%, PPV = 99.98%, SPEC = 97.17%. In further experiments simulating extreme cases, the model still achieved ACC of 99.54% and 98.91% in the three-category and five-category categories when the training sample size was much smaller than the test sample.Conclusions: Without any data augmentation methods, the proposed model not only alleviates the neg-ative impact of class imbalance and achieves excellent performance in all categories but also provides a new approach for dealing with class imbalance in arrhythmia classification. Additionally, our method demonstrates potential in conditions with fewer samples. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of single or mixed fibers (arabinoxylan, b-glucan, xyloglucan, and inulin) on the metabolome of cecum content in mice with obesity caused by a high-fat diet. Twenty-eight six-week-old male mice were divided randomly into seven groups (n = 4/group), including a normal-diet group (CON), a high-fat-diet group (HFD), and groups with the same high-fat diet but supplemented with arabinoxylan (HFAX), arabinoxylan + b-glucan (HFAb), arabinoxylan + xyloglucan (HFAG), xyloglucan (HFXG), and xyloglucan + inulin (HFXI). A total of 66 molecules were identified and quantified in cecum content by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1) H-NMR). The metabolomic profiles combined with statistical analysis revealed compounds distinguishing the control group from those supplemented with fibers. In detail, a high-fat diet could significantly elevate the concentrations of acetone and methionine (p < 0.05) while decreasing the levels of methanol, arabinose, acetate, and 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (p < 0.05) in the cecum contents of mice. Compared to HFD, the supplementation caused higher levels of fumarate and hypoxanthine (p < 0.05) and lower levels of phenylacetate, acetate, fucose, formate, proline, betaine, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (p < 0.05). An enrichment analysis highlighted that the pathways mainly altered were amino sugar metabolism, aspartate metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism. In conclusion, non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) supplementation could change the metabolomic profiles of cecum contents in obese mice as a result of a high-fat diet. Moreover, mixed NSPs exhibited more beneficial effects than singular form on gut metabolism.

AB BackgroundCanine distemper virus (CDV) is one of the most contagious and lethal viruses known to the Canidae, with a very broad and expanding host range. Autophagy serves as a fundamental stabilizing response against pathogens, but some viruses have been able to evade or exploit it for their replication. However, the effect of autophagy mechanisms on CDV infection is still unclear.ResultsIn the present study, autophagy was induced in CDV-infected Vero cells as demonstrated by elevated LC3-II levels and aggregation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 spots. Furthermore, CDV promoted the complete autophagic process, which could be determined by the degradation of p62, co-localization of LC3 with lysosomes, GFP degradation, and accumulation of LC3-II and p62 due to the lysosomal protease inhibitor E64d. In addition, the use of Rapamycin to promote autophagy promoted CDV replication, and the inhibition of autophagy by Wortmannin, Chloroquine and siRNA-ATG5 inhibited CDV replication, revealing that CDV-induced autophagy facilitated virus replication. We also found that UV-inactivated CDV still induced autophagy, and that nucleocapsid (N) protein was able to induce complete autophagy in an mTOR-dependent manner.ConclusionsThis study for the first time revealed that CDV N protein induced complete autophagy to facilitate viral replication.

TI Enhancing the foaming properties of brewer's spent grain protein by
   ultrasound treatment and glycation reaction
SO FOOD & FUNCTION
LA English
DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; STABILITY
AB The denaturation state and relatively poor solubility of brewer's spent grain protein (BSGP) have limited its industrial application. Ultrasound treatment and glycation reaction were applied to improve the structural and foaming properties of BSGP. The results showed that all ultrasound, glycation, and ultrasound-assisted glycation treatments increased the solubility and surface hydrophobicity of BSGP while decreasing its zeta potential, surface tension and particle size. Meanwhile, all these treatments resulted in a more disordered and flexible conformation of BSGP, as observed by CD spectroscopy and SEM. After grafting, the result of FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the covalent binding of -OH between maltose and BSGP. Ultrasound-assisted glycation treatment further improved the free SH and S-S content, which might be due to -OH oxidation, indicating that ultrasound promoted the glycation reaction. Furthermore, all these treatments significantly increased the foaming capacity (FC) and foam stability (FS) of BSGP. Notably, BSGP treated with ultrasound showed the best foaming properties, increasing the FC from 82.22% to 165.10% and the FS from 10.60% to 131.20%, respectively. In particular, the foam collapse rate of BSGP treated with ultrasound-assisted glycation was lower than that of ultrasound or traditional wet-heating glycation treatment. The enhanced hydrogen bonding ability and hydrophobic interaction between protein molecules caused by ultrasound and glycation might be responsible for the improved foaming properties of BSGP. Thus, ultrasound and glycation reactions were efficient methods for producing BSGP-maltose conjugates with superior foaming properties.

AB Phosphorus (P) application to terrestrial ecosystems affects not only aboveground plants but also soil P forms and phosphatase-associated microbes. The phoD gene is widespread in soil and plays an important role in P transformation. However, it is still unclear how phoD-harboring microbial communities respond to different P application rates, and the relationships between soil properties and phoD-harboring microbial community need to be better understood. In this study, the impacts of seven P application rates [0 (P0), 10 (P10), 20 (P20), 30 (P30), 40 (P40), 50 (P50), and 60 (P60) g center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1)] on the soil physicochemical properties, P forms, and phoD-harboring microbial communities were assessed. As the results, inorganic P (i.e., Resin-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and HCl-Pi) and Bio-P increased firstly and then decreased with increasing P application rate, with the highest values in the P30 treatment. Soil phoD-harboring microbial community structures in low-P (P0 similar to P30) treatments were significantly different from that in high-P (P40 similar to P60) treatments. Soil phoD-harboring microbial Shannon and Simpson diversity increased firstly and then decreased with increasing P application rate, and there was a tipping point at the P application rate of 30 g center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). The Mantel test and structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that Bio-P, TC (total carbon), Fe, NaOH-organic P (NaOH-Po), and soil pH were strongly related to the soil phoD-harboring microbial community structure. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that P application affected soil P forms and phoD-harboring microbes in an alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and there was a P application threshold for optimistic growth of phoD-harboring microbes in an alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB Carbon leakage through investment caused by emission trading system (ETS) is of great concern because it would affect the emissions-reduction effects of ETS. However, the existing literature mainly focuses on the forward in-vestment leakage caused by ETS but has not studied its reverse investment leakage. This paper constructs a the-oretical model to reveal the influence and mechanism of ETS on the reverse investment leakage of unregulated pollution-intensive firms. We adopted the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) and difference -in-difference-in-differences (DDD) models to empirically test the research hypotheses proposed in the theoretical model, coupled with the firm-province-year level data from 2004 to 2021. We obtained the following results. First, Chinese regional emission trading systems (ETSs) reduce the number of new subsidiaries of unregulated pollution-intensive firms in the ETS areas by 35.5 %, causing significant negative reverse investment leakage. Sec-ond, the ETSs inhibit firm investment through two channels: emission cost and emission risk. Third, Chinese ETSs have a stronger investment inhibition effect on firms with higher profitability, firms with higher innovation input and small firms, as well as industries with lower carbon-intensity and industries with higher concentration. Fourth, the ETSs in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, and Fujian have a significant investment inhibition ef-fect, while the ETSs in Chongqing and Tianjin do not. It is suggested that Chinese ETSs and other ETSs in the world take full account of reverse investment leakage. Governments in China's ETS regions should formulate differen-tiated anti-leakage measures, incorporate more enterprises into carbon management, and actively improve green innovation capabilities in ETS regions.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Gold nanochains (AuNCs) were prepared, and this novel material was combined with carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) to be a nanocomposite for the first time. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis spectra were used to characterize the successful preparation of AuNCs and AuNC-cMWCNT composite. Based on this hybrid material, a voltammetric sensor of bisphenol A (BPA) was established. The proposed sensor displayed excellent performance for the measurement of BPA by obvious decreased anodic peak potential and enlarged peak current. Using the optimized conditions, BPA was detected using linear sweep voltammetry, and the linear range showed as wide as 0.5 mu M to 2000 mu M with the detection limit estimated to be 12 nM (S/N = 3). The as-proposed sensor also exhibited satisfactory performance in determining BPA of actual plastic samples.

AB IntroductionThe erythrocyte membranes used in nanovaccines include high membrane stability, long circulation life, adaptability and extremely good bio compatibility. Nanoparticles encapsulated by erythrocyte membranes are widely used as ideal drug delivery vehicles because of their high drug loading, long circulation time, and excellent biocompatibility. The mannose modification of delivery materials can help target mannose receptors (MRs) to deliver antigens to antigen-presenting cells (APCs). MethodsIn this study, the antigen gene gp90 of avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) was encapsulated with carboxymethyl chitosan (CS) to obtain CSgp90 nanoparticles, which were coated with mannose-modied fowl erythrocyte membranes to yield CS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles. The physicochemical characterization and immune response of the CS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles were investigated in vitro and in vivo. ResultsCS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles were rapidly phagocytized in vitro by macrophages to induce the production of cytokines and nitric oxide. In vivo, CS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles increased cytokine levels, the CD4+/8+ ratio, REV-specific antibodies in the peripheral blood of chicks, and the mRNA levels of immune-related genes in the spleen and bursa of immunized chicks. CS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles could be targeted to lymphoid organs to prolong the retention time of the nanoparticles at the injection site and lymphatic organs, leading to a strong, sustained immune response. Moreover, the CS-gp90@M-M nano-vaccine showed a lasting immunoprotective effect and improved the body weight of chicks after the challenge. ConclusionOverall, CS-gp90@M-M nanoparticles can be used in vaccine designs as an effective delivery carrier with immune response-enhancing effects.

AB The zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 composites were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The composition, structure and optical properties of the composites were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and other spectral techniques. The as-prepared zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 composite exhibits remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for organic dye degradation and nitrogen fixation under visible light irradiation. The optimal hybrid catalyst (YCN-50) shows good photocatalytic activity for methylene blue degradation. The degradation kinetic constant is 26.6 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Photocatalytic degradation of other organic dyes including malachite green, methyl orange and rhodamine B was also studied for comparison. For the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, the ammonium production rate of zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 composite is 62.7 mu mmol g(-1) h(-1) under the optimal condition, which is 62.7 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. The high photocatalytic performance of zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 composite is due to the combination of g-C3N4 and zeolite-Y effectively improving the specific surface area and reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. The zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 composite also shows good photostability and reusability based on recycling experiments. Trapping experiment was also performed to find the responsible radical species for the degradation. The mechanism of dye degradation and nitrogen fixation in the presence of zeolite-Y/g-C3N4 was also discussed.

AB Background: The yak is the most important livestock in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and body weight directly affects the economic values of yak. Up to date, the genome-wide profiling of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associating with body weight has not been reported in yak. In the present study, the SNPs in 480 yaks from three breeds were analyzed using the commercial high-density (600 K) yak SNP chips.Results: The results identified 12 and 4 SNPs potentially associated with body weight in male and female yaks, respectively. Among them, 9 and 2 SNPs showed significant difference in yak body weight between different genotypes at each locus in male and female yaks, respectively. Further exploration found 33 coding genes within the 100 kbp upstream or downstream to the SNP loci, which might be potentially affected by the variation of SNPs. Among them, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) might be potentially affected by the SNP AX-174555047, which has been reported to affect the functioning of two body-weight associated hormones (parathyroid hormone, PTH, and adrenomedullin, ADM). Determination of PTH and ADM levels in yak revealed positive relationship between PTH level and body weight, negative relationship between ADM level and body weight along with the variation of AX-174555047 mutation.Conclusions: These results suggested that the SNP AX-174555047 might potentially affect body weight through mediating GRK4 expression and then PTH and ADM functioning. Thus, the SNP AX-174555047 might be used as a biomarker for molecular breeding of yak. More investigations are required to validate this point.

AB Model evaluation of water retention (WR) services has been commonly applied for national or global scientific assessment and decision making. However, evaluation results from different models are significantly uncertain, especially on a small regional scale. We compared the spatial-temporal variations and driving factors of the WR service by five models (i.e., the InVEST model (InVEST), precipitation storage model (PRS), water balance model I (WAB I), water balance model II (WAB II), and NPP-based surrogate model (NBS) based on partial correlation analysis and spatial statistics on the Ramsar international alpine wetland region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The results showed that the wetland area continued to decrease, and built-up land increased from 2000 to 2015. The average WR volume ranged from 2.50 to 13.65 billion m(3)center dot yr(-1), with the order from high to low being the PRS, WAB I, WAB II, and InVEST models, and the average total WR capacity was 2.21 x 10(9) by the NBS model. The WR service followed an increasing trend from north to south by the InVEST, PRS, WAB I, and WAB II models, while the NBS model presented a river network pattern of high values. The WR values were mainly reduced from 2000 to 2010 and increased from 2010 to 2015 in the PRS, WAB I, WAB II, and InVEST models, but the NBS model showed the opposite trend. Precipitation determined the spatial distribution of WR service in the InVEST, PRS, WAB I, and WAB II models. Still, the spatial variation was affected by climate factors, while the NPP data influenced the NBS model. In addition, the InVEST model in estimating WR values in wetlands and the PRS and WAB I models poorly estimate runoff, while the WAB II model might be the most accurate. These findings help clarify the applicability of the WR models in an alpine wetland region and provide a valuable background for improving the effectiveness of model evaluation.

AB GPCRs regulate multiple intracellular signaling cascades. Biasedly activating one signaling pathway over the others provides additional clinical utility to optimize GPCR-based therapies. GPCR heterodimers possess different functions from their monomeric states, including their selectivity to different transducers. However, the biased signaling mechanism induced by the heterodimerization remains unclear. Motivated by the issue, we select an important GPCR heterodimer (mu OR/SOR heterodimer) as a case and use microsecond Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulation coupled with potential of mean force and protein structure network (PSN) to probe mechanisms regarding the heterodimerization-induced constitutive fi-arrestin activity and efficacy change of the agonist DAMGO. The results show that only the lowest energy state of the mu OR/SOR heterodimer, which adopts a slightly outward shift of TM6 and an ICL2 conformation close to the receptor core, can selectively accommodate fi-arrestins. PSN further reveals important roles of H8, ICL1, and ICL2 in regulating the constitutive fi-arrestin-biased activity for the apo mu OR/SOR heterodimer. In addition, the heterodimerization can allosterically alter the binding mode of DAMGO mainly by means of W7.35. Consequently, DAMGO transmits the structural signal mainly through TM6 and TM7 in the dimer, rather than TM3 similar to the mu OR monomer, thus changing the efficacy of DAMGO from a balanced agonist to the fi-arrestin-biased one. On the other side, the binding of DAMGO to the heterodimer can stabilize mu OR/SOR heterodimers through a stronger interaction of TM1/TM1 and H8/H8, accordingly enhancing the interaction of mu OR with SOR and the binding affinity of the dimer to the fi-arrestin. The agonist DAMGO does not change main compositions of the regulation network from the dimer interface to the transducer binding pocket of the mu OR protomer, but induces an increase in the structural communication of the network, which should contribute to the enhanced fi-arrestin coupling. Our observations, for the first time, reveal the molecular mechanism of the biased signaling induced by the heterodimerization for GPCRs, which should be beneficial to more comprehensively understand the GPCR bias signaling.

AB Simple Summary Yaks (Bos grunniens) are one of the most remarkable domestic animals; however, they generally suffer from malnutrition for almost 8 months of the year, which results in yaks displaying a circannual rhythm with seasonal changes. Yaks are ruminant animals whose utilization of dietary nitrogen efficiency is only about 15.9-19.0%; a large amount of N is excreted in feces and urine. A nutritional method could be taken to improve the utilization rate of dietary nutrients and regulate the synthesis of protein. Methionine makes up the first two limiting amino acids in a corn-soybean-meal-based diet for ruminants; therefore, we added the methionine analogues to the diet to investigate its role in yaks, eventually to find an efficient way to feed yaks. This experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of methionine analogues 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid isopropyl ester (HBMi) on growth performance, nutrient apparent digestibility, serum metabolite, serum free amino acids, and rumen fermentation parameters of yaks. Twenty-four male Maiwa yaks (252.79 +/- 15.95 kg) were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments: basic diet (CON), or three HBMi (MetaSmart (MS); Adisseo Inc., Antony, France) supplementation treatments: MS1 (5 g), MS2 (10 g), and MS3 (15 g). The results showed that the increase in the supplemented MS levels linearly increased the average daily gain (p < 0.05), while the serum alkaline phosphatase activity and malondialdehyde content were increased when yaks were fed with 15 g/d MS (p < 0.05). The diet supplemented with MS linearly increased the percentages of glutamic acid and proline, and linearly or quadratically decreased the percentages of isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine (p < 0.05). Furthermore, supplementation of 10 g/d and 15 g/d MS increased ruminal microbial crude protein (p < 0.05). The ratio of acetate to propionate in the MS2 group was lower than those in CON and MS1 groups (p < 0.05). In summary, a diet supplemented with 10 g/d MS could be an effective way to improve the growth performance of fattening yaks without negative effects.

AB Geo-distributed machine learning (Geo-DML) adopts a hierarchical training architecture that includes local model synchronization within the data center and global model synchronization (GMS) across data centers. However, the scarce and heterogeneous wide area network (WAN) bandwidth can become the bottleneck of training performance. An intelligent optical device (i.e., reconfigurable optical all-drop multiplexer) makes the modern WAN topology reconfigurable, which has been ignored by most approaches to speed up Geo-DML training. Therefore, in this paper, we study scheduling algorithms to accelerate model synchronization for Geo-DML training with consideration of the reconfigurable optical WAN topology. Specifically, we use an aggregation tree for each Geo-DML training job, which helps to reduce model synchronization communication overhead across the WAN, and propose two efficient algorithms to accelerate GMS for Geo-DML: MOptree, a model-based algorithm for single job scheduling, and MMOptree for multiple job scheduling, aiming to reconfigure the WAN topology and trees by reassigning wavelengths on each fiber. Based on the current WAN topology and job information, mathematical models are built to guide the topology reconstruction, wavelength, and bandwidth allocation for each edge of the trees. The simulation results show that MOptree completes the GMS stage up to 56.16% on average faster than the traditional tree without optical-layer reconfiguration, and MMOptree achieves up to 54.6% less weighted GMS time.

AB Rational design and synthesis of carbon nanostructures doped with atomically dispersed metal sites is an effective method to improve electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Introducing mesopores into substrate carbon materials would help expose more active sites and improve mass/charge transfer in the microenvironments near active sites, thus accelerating ORR. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to construct atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon with mesoporous structures. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to synthesize atomically dispersed Fe-Nx sites doped mesoporedominated carbon nanodisks catalysts (Fe-N/CNDs) using functionalized zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-D). The Fe-N/CNDs-900 catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity (Eo = 1.03 V, E1/2 = 850 mV), as well as excellent long-term durability and methanol tolerance, ascribed to synergistic effect of the Fe-Nx active sites and the surrounding mesoporous structures. This work presents a promising method to develop highly efficient metal-nitrogen-carbon ORR catalysts using functionalized MOFs. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Drought is the most serious adversity faced by agriculture and animal husbandry industries. One strategy that plants use to adapt to water deficits is modifying the root growth and architecture. Root endodermis has cell walls reinforced with apoplastic barriers formed by the Casparian strip (CS) and suberin lamellae (SL) deposits, regulates radial nutrient transport and protects the vascular cylinder from abiotic threats. Elymus sibiricus is an economically important meso-xerophytic forage grass, characterized by high nutritional quality and strong environmental adaptability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the drought tolerance of E. sibiricus genotypes and investigate the root structural adaptation mechanism of drought-tolerant genotypes' responding to drought. Specifically, a drought tolerant (DT) and drought sensitive (DS) genotype were screened out from 52 E. sibiricus genotypes. DT showed less apoplastic bypass flow of water and solutes than DS under control conditions, as determined with a hydraulic conductivity measurement system and an apoplastic fluorescent tracer, specifically PTS trisodium-8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS). In addition, DT accumulated less Na, Mg, Mn, and Zn and more Ni, Cu, and Al than DS, regardless of osmotic stress. Further study showed more suberin deposition in DT than in DS, which could be induced by osmotic stress in both. Accordingly, the CS and SL were deposited closer to the root tip in DT than in DS. However, osmotic stress induced their deposition closer to the root tips in DS, while likely increasing the thickness of the CS and SL in DT. The stronger and earlier formation of endodermal barriers may determine the radial transport pathways of water and solutes, and contribute to balance growth and drought response in E. sibiricus. These results could help us better understand how altered endodermal apoplastic barriers in roots regulate water and mineral nutrient transport in plants that have adapted to drought environments. Moreover, the current findings will aid in improving future breeding programs to develop drought-tolerant grass or crop cultivars.

AB To explore the expression pattern of the TRIB1 gene in yak follicles and its effect on the steroidogenesis of granulosa cells (GCs). Here, 4-5 years old female yaks were treated as the subjects. Immunohis-tochemically assay found that TRIB1 protein was expressed in different developmental follicles. Among different cell types of follicles, including cumulus cells (CCs), granulosa cells (GCs) and theca cells (TCs), the TRIB1 protein was most abundant in GCs (P < 0.0001). In addition, we cloned the coding sequence (CDS) of the yak TRIB1 gene, which is 1119 bp, encoding 372 amino acids (AA). The amino acid sequence homology of TRIB1 is > 80% to those of other species, except for zebrafish. To further explore the function of TRIB1 in steroidogenesis, the pcDNA3.1( thorn )-TRIB1 eukaryotic expression vector was constructed and then transfected into GCs. The data showed that overexpression of TRIB1 significantly reduced the progesterone (P4) secretion of granulosa cells measured by ELISA assay (P < 0.05), but not Estradiol (E2) secretion. Consistently, TRIB1 gain-of-function downregulated the mRNA levels of steroidogenesis related genes steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1) and 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD) (P < 0.01), while cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (CYP17A1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Interestingly, mito-tracker staining showed that mitochondrial number significantly decreased in TRIB1 overexpressed GCs (P < 0.01). Further, overexpression of TRIB1 inhibited mRNA levels of mitochondrial biogenesis related genes, including Mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha co-activator (PPARGC1A) (P < 0.05). Conclusively, this work indicates that TRIB1 inhibited progesterone synthesis of GCs might be involved in the reduction of the mitochondria number.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vanadium dioxide nanoparticles (VO2 NPs) have been massively produced due to their excellent metal-insulator transition characteristics for various applications. Pilot studies indicated the toxicity of VO2 NPs to bacteria and mammalian cells, but the environmental hazards of VO2 NPs to plants have been unrevealed to date. In this study, we reported the inhibitive effects of VO2 NPs to the growth and photosynthesis of pea seedlings. Labo-ratory synthesized monoclinic VO2 NPs (N-VO2), commercial nanosized VO(2 )NPs (S-VO2), and commercial microsized VO2 particles (M-VO2) were carefully characterized for environmental toxicity evaluations. VO2 particles were supplemented to culture medium for seed germination and seedling growth. All three VO(2 )samples did not affect the germination rates of pee seeds, while serious growth inhibition of pea seedlings was observed at 10 mg/L for S-VO2 and N-VO2, and 100 mg/L for M-VO2. VO2 particles had no impact on the chlorophyll contents, but the photosynthesis of leaf was significantly decreased following the consequence of N-VO2 > S-VO2 > M-VO2. The inhibition of photosynthesis was attributed to the damage of acceptor side of photosystem II by VO2 particles at high concentrations. Abundant bioaccumulations of vanadium in roots aroused oxidative damage and changed the root structure. Our results collectively indicated that the phytotoxicity of VO(2 )NPs was related to the concentration, size and crystalline degree.

AB Comprehensive Summary Liquid fed fuel cells such as direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs) are considered to be promising power sources for portable electronic devices. However, the poison of CO intermediates on the state-of-the-art platinum and palladium-based electrocatalysts for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) at the anode hampers the implementation of DFAFCs technologies. Here, we report a core/shell catalyst consisting of intermetallic PdCd core and Pd shell (i-PdCd@Pd) with promoted CO anti-poison ability and thus FAOR performance. The optimal i-PdCd@Pd catalyst exhibits a high mass activity and specific activity at peak potential, which are 24 and 4 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C catalyst, respectively. We understand by in-situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that in i-PdCd@Pd, the intermetallic PdCd under-layers can induce the downshift of d-band center of surface Pd atoms, which would improve the CO tolerance and thus promote the FAOR performance.

AB BACKGROUND To improve the adjuvant activity of polysaccharides from Eucommia ulmoides leaves (PsEUL) in inducing an effective immune response against ovalbumin (OVA), PsEUL were conjugated to OVA using the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N '-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) method. The synthesized PsEUL-OVA was encapsulated using phytantriol and F127 to produce PsEUL-OVA cubosomes (Cubs), a novel delivery system. The physicochemical properties and immune modulation effects of this novel delivery system were explored. RESULTS In vitro, PsEUL-OVA/Cubs carrying large amounts of OVA were rapidly phagocytized by macrophages and upregulated macrophage proliferation, thereby stimulating cytokine production (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4). In vivo, PsEUL-OVA/Cubs increased the titer of OVA-specific antibodies (immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG2b, IgG2a and IgG1) and cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-6, IL-4 and interferon-gamma). In addition, the cubosomes promoted the differentiation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells in the spleen and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). These results indicated that PsEUL-OVA/Cubs stimulated both cellular and humoral immune responses by enhancing the phagocytic activity of DCs and macrophages and increasing the antigen presentation efficiency. CONCLUSION Collectively, the findings demonstrate that PsEUL-antigen/Cubs can be a useful delivery vehicle with immune response-promoting effects. Therefore, this study lays the foundation for the development of novel adjuvant-antigen delivery systems with potential applications in vaccine design. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Simple Summary As China's flagship animal, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) attracts much attention due to its small population and low natural reproductive rate. Therefore, artificial insemination has become the leading practical approach in the captive breeding programs of giant pandas worldwide. Seminal plasma acts as a medium between spermatozoa and the external stimuli, and its characteristics have been directly linked to fertility in both artificial insemination and natural fertilization. The current work, for the first time, attempts to characterize, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR), the metabolome of healthy giant panda seminal plasma. A total of 35 molecules were quantified, with distinct age-related trends highlighted by a multivariate analysis, and the concentrations of 2,3-butanediol were significantly different between individuals younger than 8 years and older than 13 years. In addition, isopropanol's concentration was significantly linked to estrus stages. Besides, the variations in the metabolome's profile with storage time were also evaluated. This study may serve as a reference for research wishing to shed light on the biological mechanisms affecting giant panda sperm's overall quality and may ultimately lead to novel approaches to giant panda artificial insemination. As an assisted breeding technique, artificial insemination has become the main effective practical approach in the captive breeding programs of giant panda worldwide. The composition of seminal plasma plays an important role in the success of breeding. The present work is the first attempt to characterize, by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR), the metabolome of healthy giant panda seminal plasma. A total of 35 molecules were quantified, with the concentration of 2,3-butanediol being significantly different between individuals younger than 8 years and older than 13 years, and other distinct age-related trends were highlighted by a multivariate analysis. Isopropanol's concentration was significantly linked to estrus stages. Besides, the variations in the metabolome's profile during storage were also evaluated. This study may serve as a reference for further research wishing to shed light on the biological mechanisms affecting giant panda sperm's overall quality and may ultimately lead to novel approaches to giant panda artificial insemination.

DE Dual-hop; Topology-aware; Routing protocol; UOWC
ID COMMUNICATION; DEPTH; DBR
AB Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is an emerging technology for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Compared with acoustic waves and radio frequency waves, optical waves can provide higher data rates and lower latency. However, given the limited transmission range and energy supply, as well as the existence of communication void regions in UOWC which may further deteriorate its transmission performances (e.g. packet deliver rate), effective multi-hop routing schemes are highly desirable for UOWC to expand its transmission range with satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a dual-hop topology-aware (DHTA) routing algorithm for UOWC. By adopting dual-hop routing strategy, the proposed algorithm reduces the packet entry possibility into void regions, and thus improves the packet deliver rate. And by selecting the next relay node considering both the available distance of transmission and the deviation of transmission direction, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the average energy consumption of the network. Besides, a threshold is employed by the proposed algorithm for energy balance to prevent excessive energy consumption of some nodes. The simulation results verify that the proposed DHTA routing algorithm effectively alleviates the effluence of void regions on forwarding packet and increases the packet delivery rate (PDR), with reduced average energy consumption and energy standard deviation.

AB G9 group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are considered emerging pathogens in pigs and humans, and pigs are considered a potential host reservoir for human G9 RVAs. In this study, RVAs of two genotypes, G9P[23] and G9P[13], were successfully isolated and the genomic sequences were obtained, the genome constellation is G9-P[23]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 and G9-P[13]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1 respectively. One strain which amplified from clinic faecal sample had an unique genome constellation G9-P[23]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1. All the genomic segments of three porcine G9 RVAs were closely related to those of porcine and/or porcine-like human RVAs, demonstrating that the three viruses were porcine-human reassortant strains. To study the immunogenicity of the porcine G9 RVAs, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized with inactivated vaccines derived from porcine RVAs and then mated. The highest titres of neutralizing antibodies against G9P[23] and G9P[13] porcine RVAs (1,291 +/- 35.22 and 1:232 +/- 39.28 respectively) were produced in mice 7 days after the second immunization. Suckling mice born to the vaccinated dams were protected by maternal antibodies against challenge with homologous strains. Overall, our data demonstrate the occurrence of porcine-human reassortants of G9 RVAs, and extend our understanding of the immunogenicity of porcine G9 rotaviruses. They also provide a basis for the development of a porcine G9 RVA vaccine.

AB Goats are popular in China because of their superior meat quality, delicate flesh, and unique flavor. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, the effects of lncRNAs on adipocyte differentiation in goat has not been fully elucidated yet. In this investigation, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes from Jianzhou Daer goat before and after differentiation, including both intramuscular preadipocytes (IMPA) vs. intramuscular adipocytes (IMA) and subcutaneous preadipocytes (SPA) vs. subcutaneous adipocytes (SA). A total of 289.49 G clean reads and 12,519 lncRNAs were obtained from 20 samples. In total, 3,733 differentially expressed RNAs (182 lncRNAs and 3,551 mRNAs) were identified by pairwise comparison. There were 135 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) specific to intramuscular adipocytes, 39 DELs specific to subcutaneous adipocytes, and 8 DELs common to both adipocytes in these 182 DELs. Some well-known and novel pathways associated with preadipocyte differentiation were identified: fat acid metabolism, TGF-beta signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. By integrating miRNA-seq data from another study, we also identified hub miRNAs in both types of fat cells. Our analysis revealed the unique and common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks of two kinds of adipocytes. Several lncRNAs that regulate potentially goat preadipocyte differentiation were identified, such as XR_001918 647.1, XR_001917728.1, XR_001297263.2 and LNC_004191. Furthermore, our findings from the present study may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying in goat meat quality and provide a theoretical basis for further goat molecular breeding.

AB For the purpose of overcoming the random permutation ambiguity of the frequency-domain-independent component analysis (FDICA) for blind separation of convolutive mixtures, this paper proposes an independent vector analysis (WA) detection receiver for blindly deconvolving the convolutive mixtures of digitally modulated signals for wireless communications. The foundation of IVA is through jointly carrying out separation work for different frequency bin data fusion, and the dependencies of frequency bins are exploited in solving the random permutation problem of separation signals. In addition, IVA uses multivariate prior distributions instead of the univariate distribution used in FDICA. Multivariate prior distribution is employed to preserve the interfrequency dependencies for individual sources, which can give rise to separation performance enhancement. Simulation results and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed detection method.

AB Poly (vinyl alcohol)/beta-cyclodextrin (PVA/CD) composite fibers are prepared by wet spinning followed by hot stretching. XRD results show that beta-CDs are in an amorphous state in fiber, and beta-CD can help maintain the fibrous crystal that exists in the composite fiber. The DSC results show that the total crystalline ratio of the composite fibers decreased with the increase of beta-CD. The as-prepared composite fibers were further crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (GA) to improve their usability. The crosslinked structure, together with amorphous beta-CD, contributes to the loading and sustained release of fragrance molecules that were studied. The fragrance retention ratio of PVA/CD/GA is 55.63% and 48.25% for cis-jasmone and citronella, even after 25 days. The inclusion complexes of beta-CD and fragrance molecules are confirmed by 2D-FTIR, which is responsible for the sustained release of fragrance. This study may contribute to the mass production of wearable long-term scented fabrics.

AB Y Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a pig disease caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) that is characterized with diffuse interstitial pneumonia and lung edema. High expressions of chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 are reported in infected porcine lungs. Since CXCR3 is a key player in host inflammatory response, it might be a therapeutic target to treat lung damage caused by PRRSV infection. The size of pigs has long hampered research into molecular mechanisms of PRRS and validating the potential pharmaceutical targets. In this study, a porcine lung xenograft model with PRRSV infection was generated in immunodeficient mice to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 on PRRSV infection-induced lung injury. The porcine lung tissues developed normally two weeks after xeno-transplantation in the mouse kidney capsule. Infection of PRRSV resulted in its efficient replication in the xenografts and histological damage to the porcine lung tissue structure, with no or little effects on mouse lungs. AMG487 administration dramatically reduced the number of PRRSV genome copies and significantly alleviated the porcine lung injury. Furthermore, treatment of AMG487 in cultured porcine macrophages consistently suppressed PRRSV replication with significant down-regulation of Annexin A2 (ANXA2), a cellular protein facilitating viral replication. These findings provide a suitable model for evaluating new antiviral therapies as well as a possible therapeutic option for virus infection-induced lung injury.

TI Inter-patient automated arrhythmia classification: A new approach of

SO COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Arrhythmia classification; Data imbalance; Deep learning; Improved
   weight capsule
ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; HEARTBEAT CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES
AB Objective: We propose a new capsule network to compensate for the information loss in the deep convolutional networks in previous studies, and to improve the performance of arrhythmia classification.
   Methods: We proposed the innovative weight capsule model which uses a weight capsule network combined with sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) modeling to classify arrhythmia, and explored the performance of this approach.
   Results: Based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, we obtained better results compared with previous studies without data enhancement and balance for the samples. The specific performance was as follows: accuracy (ACC) = 99.85%; Class N: sensitivity (SEN) = 99.66%, positive predictive value (PPV) = 99.97%, specificity (SPEC) = 99.72%; Class S: SEN = 99.56%, PPV = 92.23%, SPEC = 99.68%; Class V: SEN = 99.97%, PPV = 99.38%, PPV = 99.96%; Class F: SEN = 93.81%, PPV = 100.00%, SPEC = 100.00%. When only half of the training sample was used, the method showed that the average accuracy and sensitivity of Class V and F were 1.57%, 2.01%, and 1.55% higher, respectively, than the traditional machine learning algorithm using the whole training sample.
   Conclusion: Applying a weight capsule network combined with a Seq2Seq model in the field of arrhythmia not only alleviates the problem of inter-category sample imbalance effectively, but also improves the arrhythmia classification.
   Significance: Our study suggests a new idea for solving the problem of small sample sizes and inter-category sample imbalance in the medical field. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is characterized by a pronounced lymphopenia that is associated with immune suppression. However, the mechanisms leading to lymphopenia remain unclear. In this study, the number of total CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and NK cells in the peripheral blood were dramatically reduced in C57BL/6 mice infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O, and it was noted that mice with severe clinical symptoms had expressively lower lymphocyte counts than mice with mild or without clinical symptoms, indicating that lymphopenia was associated with disease severity. A further analysis revealed that lymphocyte apoptosis and trafficking occurred after FMDV infection. In addition, coinhibitory molecules were upregulated in the expression of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from FMDV-infected mice, including CTLA-4, LAG-3, 2B4, and TIGIT. Interestingly, the elevated IL-10 in the serum was correlated with the appearance of lymphopenia during FMDV infection but not IL-6, IL-2, IL-17, IL-18, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha/beta, TGF-beta, and CXCL1. Knocking out IL-10 (IL-10(-/-)) mice or blocking IL-10/IL-10R signaling in vivo was able to prevent lymphopenia via downregulating apoptosis, trafficking, and the coinhibitory expression of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, which contribute to enhance the survival of mice infected with FMDV. Our findings support that blocking IL-10/IL-10R signaling may represent a novel therapeutic approach for FMD.

TI Robust adaptive filtering algorithms based on (inverse)hyperbolic sine

DT Article
ID STEP-SIZE; LMS
AB Recently, adaptive filtering algorithms were designed using hyperbolic functions, such as hyperbolic cosine and tangent function. However, most of those algorithms have few parameters that need to be set, and the adaptive estimation accuracy and convergence performance can be improved further. More importantly, the hyperbolic sine function has not been discussed. In this paper, a family of adaptive filtering algorithms is proposed using hyperbolic sine function (HSF) and inverse hyperbolic sine function (IHSF) function. Specifically, development of a robust adaptive filtering algorithm based on HSF, and extend the HSF algorithm to another novel adaptive filtering algorithm based on IHSF; then continue to analyze the computational complexity for HSF and IHSF; finally, validation of the analyses and superiority of the proposed algorithm via simulations. The HSF and IHSF algorithms can attain superior steady-state performance and stronger robustness in impulsive interference than several existing algorithms for different system identification scenarios, under Gaussian noise and impulsive interference, demonstrate the superior performance achieved by HSF and IHSF over existing adaptive filtering algorithms with different hyperbolic functions.

AB Using a rich dataset of mayors and municipal party committee secretaries from 289 prefecture-level cities for the period 1994-2018, this paper analyzes the influence of government officials' educational background, political capital and individual characteristics on tourism economic growth by the panel model. Results suggest that mayors and municipal party committee secretaries with higher academic qualifications and social science backgrounds focus more on the development of inbound tourism. Longer tenure has a positive impact on the overall tourism income, domestic tourism income and inbound tourism income. In contrast, there is no direct positive relationship between officials' involvement in politics in their hometowns and the regional tourism economy. The age and gender of officials have no effect on the development of regional tourism. These conclusions can help predict China's regional tourism development based on the government official appointment and provide practical implications on the appointment process itself.

AB The present study aims to investigate the expression and function of lysine-specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B) in yak cumulus cells (CCs) in order to reveal the mechanisms by which KDM4B regulates biological characteristics and function of CCs. The cellular location of KDM4B and the methylation pattern of H3K9 were detected using immunofluorescence (IF) staining in CCs. The mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related genes (BCL-2, HAX1 and BAX) and genes related to the estrogen pathway (ESR2, CYP17 and 3B-HSD) were estimated by qRT-PCR after knockdown of KDM4B expression by siRNA in yak CCs. Then, a proliferation assay, Annexin V-FITC staining, and ELISA were utilized to explore the effects of KDM4B silencing on CCs proliferation, apoptosis, and estrogen (E-2) secretion, respectively. The results showed that KDM4B is located in the nuclei of yak CCs and is distributed in a dotted pattern. Knockdown KDM4B induced a decrease in cell proliferation, an increase in apoptotic rate and a reduction in the levels of E-2 secretion of CCs. Additionally, the methylation patterns of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 were significantly increased in CCs transfected with KDM4B siRNA-1 (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression level of apoptosis promoting BAX genes was significantly upregulated, but 3B-HSD, ESR2 and anti-apoptotic HAX1 genes were significantly downregulated in transfected CCs (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of embryos developing from the 2-cell stage to blastocysts was lower in the siRNA-1 transfection group than that of the control group (28.6 +/- 2.9% vs 40.4 +/- 2.4%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, our study indicates that KDM4B regulates the biological characteristics and physiological function of yak CCs mainly through changing the methylation patterns of H3K9 and related gene expression levels.

AB An atom-economical and environmentally benign approach for the synthesis of 3-indolylquinones was achieved successfully via direct oxidative C-C coupling of quinones/hydroquinones with indoles using (NH4)(2)S2O8 in dichloroethane at 80 degrees C. The efficiency of this catalytic approach was established by a broad scope of substrates involving quinones and hydroquinones to give high yields (61-93%) of 3-indolylquinones. The present protocol is simple, practical, and show good functional group tolerance. In addition, the obtained 3-indolylnaphthoquinones were conducted to further transformation to synthesize 2-amino-3-indolylnaphthoquinone and polycyclic N-heterocycles, respectively.

AB Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection triggers cytokine production via pattern recognition receptors. These cytokines include type I interferons (IFNs) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Excessive type I IFN levels impair host resistance to M. bovis infection. Therefore, strict control of type I IFN production is helpful to reduce pathological damage and bacterial burden. Here, we found that a deficiency in caspase-1, which is the critical component of the inflammasome responsible for IL-1 beta production, resulted in increased IFN-beta production upon M. bovis infection. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that caspase-1 activation reduced cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) expression, thereby inhibiting downstream TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signaling and ultimately reducing IFN production. A deficiency in caspase-1 activation enhanced the bacterial burden during M. bovis infection in vitro and in vivo and aggravated pathological lesion formation. Thus, caspase-1 activation reduced IFN-beta production upon M. bovis infection by dampening cGAS-TBK1-IRF3 signaling, suggesting that the inflammasome protects hosts by negatively regulating harmful cytokines.

AB A highly stereoselective cascade Michael/alkylation process has been established to construct 2-trifluoromethylated and 2-difluoromethylated dihydrofurans from readily available starting materials. In the presence of a bifunctional squaramide, the annulation approach proceeded smoothly to afford the desired fluorinated dihydrofurans in 59-99% isolated yields with 82-96% ee and 8 : 1->20 : 1 dr. This catalytic strategy was well compatible with various structurally distinct beta,beta-bromonitrostyrenes and fluorinated acetoacetates. Profound synthetic manipulation could be performed on the resulting products.

AB The most stable structures of Ge6M (M = Ge, Al) clusters and reactions of Ge6M clusters with a single water molecule are investigated theoretically by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and reaction pathway search method at the same level. The calculated binding energies of Ge-7 and Ge6Al clusters show that the stabilities of two clusters are close. The most stable geometric structures and electronic structures of Ge6M@H2O complex and reaction pathways of Ge6M with a single H2O molecule are predicted. All geometric structures of reactants, intermediate products, final products and transition states are confirmed by frequency analysis. Our results show that both of Ge-7 and Ge6Al clusters can completely release H-2 from water after a three steps reaction and both reactions are endothermic. The calculated adsorption energies and energy barriers indicate that the dopant Al atom will improve the reactivity between Ge-7 cluster and water.

AB Lipid metabolism, which encompasses synthesis and degradation of lipids, is critical for a wide range of cellular functions, including structural and morphological properties of organelles, energy storage, signalling, and the stability and function of membrane proteins. Adipose tissue is a dynamic tissue type that performs a lot of significant physiological functions, including secretion, and is involved in maintaining homeostasis and in regulatory roles of other tissues based on paracrine or endocrine. More recently, several classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA), have been discovered in adipocytes, and they act as critical regulators of gene expression in adipogenesis and regulate adipogenesis through multiple pathways. In the present paper, we discussed several classes of non-coding RNAs and summarized the latest research on the regulatory role of ncRNAs in bovine adipogenesis. We gave examples for known modes of action to look forward to providing reference information future scientific research in cattle breeding.

TI Mechanistic insight into the influence of O2 on
   N2O formation in the selective catalytic reduction of NO with
   NH3 over Pd/CeO2 catalyst
SO CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Noble metal nanoparticles supported on metal oxides have been extensively investigated as potential selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts to control NOX emissions, but suffer from the formation of N2O. Herein, the N2O formation mechanism during the NH3-SCR process over the Pd/CeO2 catalyst was investigated by both experimental methods and density functional theory calculations. Our results revealed that O-2 greatly affected the pathway for NO reduction, which resulted in a temperature-dependent SCR performance and N2O formation. At a temperature below 175 degrees C, fast-SCR was the main reaction route for NO removal, which was attributed to the spontaneous oxidation of NO to NO2. In the temperature range of 175-250 degrees C, the activation of NH3 facilitated the reduction of NO through standard-SCR, which promoted the removal of NO but also induced the formation of N2O. At a temperature above 250 degrees C, NH3 was severely deep oxidized, which induced the formation of excess N2O in the presence of even a low amount of O-2 of 1 vol%.

AB Palladium (Pd) is considered as the most promising catalyst for hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition (FAD), but pristine Pd catalysts are less active and readily to perform activity decay by CO poisoning. Thus the modulation of Pd is critical for its application in H-2 production from FAD. Here a Pd/APPNs catalysts by anchoring ca. 2.1 +/- 0.3 nm Pd nanoparticles in the amino-pyridine polymer networks (designated as APPNs) was designed based on so-called metal-support interaction. The strong interaction between Pd and N of amine-pyridine unites was demonstrated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis. It suggests the electron transfer between N and Pd, which could lower the d-band center of Pd and further effectively enhance the FAD catalysis performance. The initial FAD TOF value of 512 h(-1) and the activation energy (Ea) of ca. 22.1 kJ mol(-1) give a proper proof for the catalysis enhancement. And the third time FAD run still show a 442 h(-1) TOF, indicating an excellent catalysis stability. In addition, the production analysis by Gas chromatography (GC) show that no CO was detected. This CO-free production was also confirmed through no observation of Surface-enhanced Adsorption Infrared Spectral (SEIRAS) band at 1700-2100 cm(-1) (i.e. the COad species) on Pd/ANNPs surface. This work indicates that direct modification of Pd by the functionalized support (metal-support interaction) could effective enhance the FAD catalysis performance, although further work combined with other tuning means should be push forward.

TI Tea Catechin Inhibits Biofilm Formation of Methicillin-Resistant S.

SO JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY

DT Article
AB Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most common pathogen causing infections from skin to systemic infections. The success of S. aureus infections can partially be attributed to its antibiotic resistance and to its ability to form biofilm. An increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) becomes a global public health problem in recent decades. Here, the effects of tea catechin extracts on the growth and biofilm formation of three MRSA strains were investigated. The results revealed that tea catechin extracts potently suppressed MRSA growth, and the minimal inhibitory concentration of tea catechin extracts against these MRSA strains was 0.1 g/L. Then, tea catechin extracts inhibited biofilm formation of these strains in a dose-dependent manner measured with a colorimetric method, and the inhibitory effect was also demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy assay. Moreover, adhesin genes biofilm-associated protein (bap), bone sialoprotein-binding protein (bbp), collagen-binding protein (cna), clumping factors A (clfA), fibronectin binding protein A and B (fnbA and fnbB), and intercellular adhesion gene BC (icaBC) were scanned, and the results shown that fnbA and icaBC were present in these three strains. Furthermore, tea catechin extracts depressed fnbA and icaBC expression in the strains. Therefore, inhibition of biofilm formation by tea catechin extracts probably was associated with downregulation of fnbA and icaBC expression in these strains.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a fundamental and important low-level computer vision (CV) task, yet its performance on real-world applications is not always satisfactory. Different from the previous SISR research, we focus on a specific but realistic SR issue: How can we obtain satisfied SR results from com-pressed JPG (C-JPG) images, which is a ubiquitous image format to greatly release storage space while missing fine details. the JPG SR task is deeply analyzed to discover the connotation. Then, we propose an effective two-step model structure named RGSR, involving two specifically designed components, i.e., JPG recovering and SR generation, instead of the perspective of noise elimination in traditional SR approaches. Besides, we further integrate the cycle loss to build a hybrid objective across scales for better SR generation. Experimental results on both of the standard test data sets and real images show that our approach achieves outstanding results and succeed in applying to practical C-JPG SR tasks.

AB Elastic optical networks (EONs) have realized high-speed data transmission with attractively efficiency and flexibility in resource utilization. In order to guarantee the reliability and increase the efficiency of the multicast transmission in EONs, we propose a multiple leaf-ringing based protection algorithm with spectrum defragmentation (MLRP-SD) in this article. The proposed algorithm firstly sorts the destination nodes of a multicast service into multiple groups. Then, it constructs one leaf ring for all the destination nodes in one group and two dedicated trunk paths (including one protection trunk path) from the source to each constructed ring. Since a leaf ring can provide protection for the destination nodes in its corresponding group, the reliability of multicast traffic can be improved. And the use of leaf rings can reduce the spectrum consumed in service protection compared to the traditional dedicated path protection (DPP) algorithms. In order to further improve the efficiency, the proposed MLRP-SD algorithm triggers spectrum defragmentation to re-optimize resource utilization in the network when sufficient available spectrum resources cannot be found along the sought protection trunk paths. The simulation results show that the proposed MLRP-SD algorithm can guarantee the reliability of multicast traffic with low service blocking probability.

AB Rotavirus A (RVA) is a major diarrhoea-causing pathogen in young animals and children. The zoonotic potential of RVA has received extensive attention in recent years. In May 2018, an outbreak of diarrhoea among piglets occurred on a swine farm in Sichuan province, PR China. RVA was detected in 95.7% (22/23) of piglet samples, 60% (9/15) of sow samples and 100% (3/3) of pig-breeder faecal samples. The predominant RVA genotype on this swine farm was G3P[13], and G3P[13] RVA was also detected in the three breeder faecal samples. Three G3P [13] RVA strains were isolated from a piglet faecal sample, a sow faecal sample and a pig-breeder faecal sample, and were named SCLS-X1, SCLS-3 and SCLS-R3, respectively. The complete sequences of 11 gene segments of these three isolates were derived. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ten gene segments (VP7, VP4, VP1-VP3 and NSP1-NSP5) of pig-breeder isolate SCLS-R3 were closely related to pig isolates SCLS-X1 and SCLS-3 from this farm. Only the VP6 gene shared higher homology with human RVA strain 1321. Therefore, a G3P[13] porcine RVA strain most likely infected pig breeders. These results provided the first complete epidemiological link demonstrating interspecies transmission of G3P[13] RVA from pigs to human. Our data contribute to an improved understanding of the genetic evolution and interspecies transmission of RVA.

AB Background and aims Responses of grassland carbon (C) cycling to changes in precipitation and land use remain a major uncertainty in model prediction of future climate. It remains even far from clear on how does clipping regulate the response sensitivity of grassland C sequestration to precipitation change. Methods We conducted a manipulative field experiment with five precipitation treatments (1/12P, 1/4P, 1/2P, 3/4P, P, and 5/4P, where P is the growing season precipitation) interacting with clipping treatments in an alpine meadow to examine net ecosystem C uptake and its associated processes in response to clipping and precipitation gradients as well as their interaction. Results (1) clipping significantly increased soil temperature in 2016 and 2017, while had no effect on soil moisture; (2) clipping also stimulated the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) during the two growing seasons; (3) although there were no significantly interactive effects of clipping with precipitation changes, clipping increased the response sensitivity of C uptakes to soil moisture changes. NEP increased more with soil moisture under clipping (0.21 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) v/v(-1)) than unclipping treatments (0.11 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) v/v(-1)). This was due to the compensatory growth and the positive effect of clipping on soil temperature, which stimulated plant growth and productivity. Conclusions Our findings suggest that clipping will aggravate grassland's sensitivity to precipitation change. These findings highlight the important role of land use change in regulating ecosystem C sequestration under further climate conditions in an alpine meadow.

AB Fat metabolism is an important and complex biochemical reactionin vivoand is regulated by many factors. Recently, the findings on high expression of fibroblast growth factor-16 (FGF16) in brown adipose tissue have led to an interest in exploring its role in lipogenesis and lipid metabolism. The study cloned the goat'sFGF16 gene 624 bp long, including the complete open reading frame that encodes 207 amino acids. We found thatFGF16 expression is highest in goat kidneys and hearts, followed by subcutaneous fat and triceps. Moreover, the expression ofFGF16 reached its peak on the 2nd day of adipocyte differentiation (P< 0.01) and then decreased significantly. We used overexpression and interference to study the function ofFGF16 gene in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Silencing ofFGF16 decreased adipocytes lipid droplet aggregation and triglyceride synthesis. This is in contrast to the situation whereFGF16 is overexpressed. Furthermore, knockdown ofFGF16 also caused down-regulated expression of genes associated with adipocyte differentiation including CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (P< 0.01), fatty acid-binding protein-2 (P< 0.01) and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (P< 0.05), but the preadipocyte factor-1 was up-regulated. At the same time, the genes adipose triglyceride lipase (P< 0.01) and hormone-sensitive lipase (P< 0.05) associated with triglyceride breakdown were highly expressed. Next, we locked the fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGFR4) through the protein interaction network and interfering withFGF16 to significantly reduceFGFR4 expression. It was found that the expression profile ofFGFR4 in adipocyte differentiation was highly similar to that ofFGF16. Overexpression and interference methods confirmed thatFGFR4 andFGF16 have the same promoting function in adipocyte differentiation. Finally, using co-transfection technology, pc-FGF16 and siRNA-FGFR4, siRNA2-FGF16 and siRNA-FGFR4 were combined to treat adipocytes separately. It was found that in the case of overexpression ofFGF16, cell lipid secretion and triglyceride synthesis showed a trend of first increase and then decrease with increasing interference concentration. In the case of interference withFGF16, lipid secretion and triglyceride synthesis showed a downward trend with the increase of interference concentration. These findings illustrated thatFGF16 mediates adipocyte differentiation via receptorFGFR4 expression and contributed to further study of the functional role ofFGF16 in goat fat formation.

AB Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), which can infect almost all mammals, is a zoonotic virus. In this study, six strains of type 2 MRV (MRV2) were isolated from 7 diarrhea piglets from a farm that had an outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in 2018, which tested negative for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and porcine group A rotavirus (RAV). The MRV2 isolate infected neonatal piglets, in which it induced severe diarrhea, while the virus was detected in multiple organs of piglets. Moreover, the complete genome of an MRV2 isolate was obtained, which was a novel reassortant MRV strain of human MRV, porcine MRV, chamois MRV, bat MRV, and mink MRV based on the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic tree. The S1 gene of isolate had eight unique amino acid mutations compared with available MRV2 S1 in the GenBank. To investigate the prevalence of this MRV2, 78 samples of diarrhea feces were collected from 10 pig farms in seven regions of Sichuan province. The obtained results showed that the positive rate of samples was 14% (11/78), and positive rate of farms was 60% (6/10), while the amplified fragments shared the identical amino acid mutations with the isolated strain, thus suggesting that this MRV2 strain was already prevalent in Sichuan province. The present study was first to isolate a pig-derived type 2 MRV strain in China, obtaining the complete genome of this strain, which furthers our understanding of the MRV2 epidemic and evolution.

AB Roegneriais a polyploid perennial genus in the tribe Triticeae. Some species ofRoegneriaare morphologically similar to genusElymusand have been classified inElymus. To investigate the delimitation and phylogenetic relationships ofRoegneria, nuclear (ITS,Acc1, andPgk1) and chloroplast (trnL-trnF) DNA regions were sequenced for 38 allopolyploid species and 32 diploid species of Triticeae. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear DNA revealed that allRoegneriaspecies were included in the St and Y genome clades, and that the Y genome was closely related to the V and Xp genomes. The chloroplast DNA dataset showed thatRoegneriaspecies were grouped withPseudoroegneriaspecies. ThePseudoroegneriaspecies from the Middle East (P. libanoticaandP. tauri) and Central Asia (P. strigosa) were more closely related toRoegneriaspecies. The results suggested that: (i) the species containing the St and Y genomes should be segregated fromElymusand treated as a distinct genus,Roegneria, based on the genomic constitution; (ii)P. libanotica, P. tauri, and/orP. strigosapotentially served as the maternal donor of the St genome inRoegneria; (iii) The Y genome ofRoegneriaoriginated from a diploid Y genome species, and the V and Xp genomes may have contributed to Y genome formation; (iv) amongRoegneriaspecies of previously uncertain genomic constitution,R. seriotinawas tetraploid and possessed the StY genomes,E. calcicoluswas hexaploid with the StYH genomic constitution and should be classified inCampeiostachys, R. glaucifoliapossessed the StStY genomes, andR. tschimganicahad the genomic constitution St(1)St(2)Y.

AB Excessive cell proliferation due to cell cycle disorders is one of the hallmarks of breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are involved in the transition of the cell cycle from G1 phase to S phase by combining CDKs with cyclin, are considered promising targets with broad therapeutic potential based on their critical role in cell cycle regulation. Pharmacological evidence has shown that abnormal cell cycle due to the overexpression of CDK6 is responsible for the hyperproliferation of cancer cells. Blocking CDK6 expression inhibits tumour survival and growth. Therefore, CDK6 can be regarded as a potential target for anticancer therapeutics. Thus, small molecules that can be considered CDK inhibitors have been developed into promising anticancer drugs. In this study, combined structure-based and ligand-basedin siliconmodels were created to identify new chemical entities against CDK6 with the appropriate pharmacokinetic properties. The database used to screen drug-like compounds in this thesis was based on the best E-pharmacophore hypothesis and the best ligand-based drug hypothesis. As a result, 147 common compounds were identified by further molecular docking. Surprisingly, the in vitro evaluation results of 20 of those compounds showed that the two had good CDK6 inhibitory effects. The best compound was subjected to kinase panel screening, followed by molecular dynamic simulations. The 50-ns MD studies revealed the pivotal role of VAL101 in the binding of inhibitors to CDK6. Overall, the identification of two new chemical entities with CDK6 inhibitory activity demonstrated the feasibility and potential of the new method.

DT Article
DE Natural disasters; Macroeconomic fluctuation; SVAR model; SUR model
AB This study attempts to construct an econometric model using China's natural disaster losses and macro-industry development data from 1980 to 2017 to explore the macroeconomic fluctuations caused by natural disasters. The structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) and the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models are employed in estimating the impact of natural disasters on China's macroeconomy and how the disasters specifically affect the three sectors of the economy: primary, secondary, and tertiary. This study concludes that even though natural disasters in China do not significantly affect the overall real GDP, they have adverse impacts on the production in the primary industry, causing a sudden reduction in the means of production in the market and directly affecting various industries, but the impact on the secondary and tertiary industries is weak. This study also shows that the effect of natural disasters on the primary sector reduced significantly following industry restructuring after China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The impact of natural disasters on the primary industry could be reduced by adjusting the industrial structure to deal with macroeconomic shocks caused by natural disasters in order to promote macroeconomic stability of both regional and national economies. Finally, national aid policy should focus on the primary industry since that sector is significantly affected by natural disasters shocks.

AB Background The yak is a species of livestock which is crucial for local communities of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and adjacent regions and naturally owns one more thoracic vertebra than cattle. Recently, a sub-population of yak termed as the Jinchuan yak has been identified with over half its members own a thoracolumbar vertebral formula of T15L5 instead of the natural T14L5 arrangement. The novel T15L5 positioning is a preferred genetic trait leading to enhanced meat and milk production. Selective breeding of this trait would have great agricultural value and exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying this trait would both accelerate this process and provide us insight into the development and regulation of somitogenesis. Results Here we investigated the genetic background of the Jinchuan yak through resequencing fifteen individuals, comprising five T15L5 individuals and ten T14L5 individuals with an average sequencing depth of > 10X, whose thoracolumbar vertebral formulae were confirmed by anatomical observation. Principal component analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis, phylogenetic analysis, and selective sweep analysis were carried out to explore Jinchuan yak's genetic background. Three hundred and thirty candidate markers were identified as associated with the additional thoracic vertebrae and target sequencing was used to validate seven carefully selected markers in an additional 51 Jinchuan yaks. The accuracies of predicting 15 thoracic vertebrae and 20 thoracolumbar vertebrae with these 7 markers were 100.00 and 33.33% despite they both could only represent 20% of all possible genetic diversity. Two genes, PPP2R2B and TBLR1, were found to harbour the most candidate markers associated with the trait and likely contribute to the unique somitic number and identity according to their reported roles in the mechanism of somitogenesis. Conclusions Our findings provide a clear depiction of the Jinchuan yak's genetic background and a solid foundation for marker-assistant selection. Further exploitation of this unique population and trait could be promoted with the aid of our genomic resource.

AB Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology has been applied in the construction of disease model, production of transgenic animals, therapeutic cloning, and other fields. However, the cloning efficiency remains limited. In our study, to improve SCNT efficiency, brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) staining were chosen to select recipient oocytes. In addition, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor Zebularine (5nmol/L) and histone deacetylase inhibitor Scriptaid (0.2 mu mol/L) were jointly used to treat sheep donor cumulus cells and reconstructed embryo. Moreover, the expression levels of embryonic development-related genes (OCT4, SOX2, H19, IGF2 and Dnmt1) of reconstructed embryo were also detected. Using BCBthornoocytes as recipient cell, donor cumulus cells and reconstructed embryos were treated with 5nmol/L Zebularine and 0.2 mu mol/L Scriptaid, the blastocyst rate in ZebthornSCR-SCNT group (28.25%) was significantly higher than SCNT (21.16%) (p< 0.05). Furthermore, results showed that expression levels of OCT4, SOX2, H19, IGF2 and Dnmt1 genes in ZebthornSCR-SCNT embryos were more similar to IVF embryos. Our study proved that 5nmol/L Zebularine and 0.2 mu mol/ L Scriptaid treating with sheep donor cumulus cells and reconstructed embryos improved SCNT blastocyst rate and relieve the abnormal expression of embryonic developmental related genes.

AB Mobile edge computing provides high computing power, data storage capacity and bandwidth requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) through edge servers that process data close to data sources or users. In practical, mobile edge computing can be used to implement image steganography in IoT. Considering imperceptibility, security and capacity are important indicators for image steganography, this paper propose an image steganography based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMOsteg). The EMOsteg preprocesses the image through a high-pass filters bank to find noise and texture regions that are difficult to model. By perturbing the image on noise and texture regions in multiple directions, the embedded capacity is increased. By defining the imperceptibility and security as an antigen, defining the perturbation positions of the cover image as an antibody, the EMOsteg uses the artificial immune principle to heuristically obtain the perturbation population through feature extraction of the perturbation and adaptive evolution operations. And the Pareto optimal is used to find the optimal perturbation in the last generation population. The simulation experiments analyze the convergence of the algorithm and the diversity of the solutions. In simulation experiments, the MSE, PSNR and SSIM were adopted to evaluate the imperceptibility, and the results show that the MSE value of our algorithm is 0.000308, the PSNR is 82.7501 and the SSIM approaches 1, they are better than comparison algorithms. The average detection error P-E under SPA was adopted to detect the security, and the results show that our algorithm is more robust against anti-SPA steganalysis. In order to evaluate the performance of real-time, the embedding time of the same secret under different algorithms were compared, and the results show that our algorithm is faster than comparison algorithms in the terminal. In summary, the proposed algorithm can maintain the image quality while resist steganalysis tools, and realize real-time processing.

AB Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an intractable genitourinary malignancy that accounts for approximately 4% of adult malignancies. Currently, there is no approved targeted therapy for RCC that has yielded durable remissions, and they remain palliative in intent. Emerging evidence has indicated that renal tumorigenesis and RCC treatment-resistance may originate from renal cancer stem cells (CSCs) with tumor-initiating capacity (CSC hypothesis). A better understanding of the mechanism underlying renal CSCs will help to dissect RCC heterogeneity and drug treatment efficiency, to promote more personalized and targeted therapies. In this review, we summarized the stem cell characteristics of renal CSCs. We outlined the targeting strategies and challenges associated with developing therapies that target renal CSCs angiogenesis, immunosuppression, signaling pathways, surface biomarkers, microRNAs and nanomedicine. In conclusion, CSCs are an important role in renal carcinogenesis and represent a valid target for treatment of RCC patients.

AB Difluoromethylphosphonate, as an in vivo stable phosphate bio-isostere, is an important organofluorophosphine block. In this paper, an efficient and general protocol for the construction of CF2P-containing heterocycles via visible-light-mediated nucleophilic cyclization of unsaturated carboxylic acids, alcohol and sulfonamides has been developed. This reaction can be carried out smoothly under mild conditions with less catalyst loading, producing several types of CF2P-containing heterocycles, including CF2P-lactone, CF2P-phthalide, CF2P-tetrahydrofuran and CF2P-pyrrolidine.

AB Understanding the origin of photoluminescence intermittency and its correlation with microstructure is crucial for the design and preparation of quantum dots (QDs) with high fluorescence quantum yield. ZnSe clusters provide a typical model for studying the effect of their size, geometrical and electronic structures on their radiative and non-radiative process of II-VI QDs. The rate constants of radiative and non-radiative processes, k(r) and k(nr), of the (ZnSe)(n) clusters were computed by using first-principles calculations, Einstein spontaneous radiation theory and Fermi's golden rule. The k(r) and k(nr) variations with cluster size were analyzed in term of a number of quantities. Emission energy and reorganization energy were identified to play dominant roles in the determination of k(r) and k(nr) for the studied clusters. Furthermore, a correlation between these two quantities and the geometric rigidity of the ZnSe clusters was revealed. The clusters with greater geometric rigidity tend to possess larger emission energy, and smaller reorganization energy. While radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination rates of the ZnSe clusters vary in a complicated way because of their diverse structures and prominent quantum size effect, our study highlights the correlation between recombination rate and cluster structure, which would be helpful for the design of QD materials with high fluorescence quantum yields.

AB Lead-free piezoceramics of Ba0.86Sr0.14Ti1-xZrxO3 (BSTZ(x)) are prepared by the conventional solid-state method. The microstructure, phase structure and electrical properties of BSTZ(x) ceramics in the composition range of 0 <= x <= 0.1 are systematically studied. The coexistence of the rhombohedral phase, tetragonal phase, and orthorhombic phase is determined in the ceramic with 0.06 <= x <= 0.08, showing enhanced electrical properties in the ceramics with x = 0.08, especially the large piezoelectric property (similar to 620 pC/N) and high epsilon(r) value (similar to 4743), which is superior or comparable to the other BT-based ceramics. As a result, the addition of the Zr can effectively improve the electricity of the BaTiO3-based ceramics, which can be beneficial to facilitate the practical process of BT-based ceramics.

AB At temperatures greater than 70 degrees C, the introduction of air in the slurry preparation process in slag hydration of solidified stone produces cracking and thermal stresses. In the study, slag cementing slurries at 90 degrees C were used to join brucite fibers. The mechanical performance, toughening mechanism, and microstructural changes were studied using tensile tests, XRD, TGA, SEM, IR, and triaxial tests. After curing for 14 and 28 days, the compressive and tensile strengths of 6 wt% brucite fiber-reinforced slag increased by 69.08 and 45.98% and 73.58 and 69.08%, respectively, while the elastic modulus decreased 8.4% compared to the control samples The brucite fibers were randomly distributed in the slag cementing slurries, resulting in a toughened material via energy dissipation caused by bridging peel and pulling-out. This result provides theoretical background to solve strength attenuation and cracking phenomenon at high temperature in solidified slag stones.

AB This study investigated the complementary effect of three orientations of knowledge management (KM) strategy on firm performance: external and internal, explicit and tacit, and exploratory and exploitive. We propose a theoretical framework for examining the synergistic effects of KM strategy on firm performance, and the moderating effect of organizational structure. The complementary effect among these orientations of KM strategy was studied. To test our framework, we conducted a survey with a sample of 345 Chinese firms that had applied a KM strategy. The empirical results show that: (1) different KM strategy orientations complement each other, and this complementarity is an essential link in the relationship between KM strategy and firm performance; (2) the direct effect of each orientation of KM strategy on firm performance is not significant; (3) a centralized organizational structure moderates the relationship between KM strategy and firm performance, thus the more centralized is the organizational structure, the stronger is the positive impact of the complementary effect of KM strategy on firm performance; and (4) the moderating effect of formalized organizational structure in the relationship between KM strategy and firm performance is not significant.

ID IMAGE; RECONSTRUCTION
AB Compressive sensing (CS) aims at reconstructing high dimensional data from a small number of samples or measurements. In this paper, we propose the minimization of a non-convex functional for the solution of the CS problem. The considered functional incorporates information on the self-similarity of the image by measuring the rank of some appropriately constructed matrices of fairly small dimensions. However, since the rank minimization is a NP hard problem, we consider, as a surrogate function for the rank, a non-convex, but smooth function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed functional and develop an iterative algorithm to compute one of its stationary points. We prove the convergence of such algorithm and show, with some selected numerical experiments, that the proposed approach achieves good performances, even when compared with the state of the art.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common contaminant of grain worldwide and is often detected in the human diet and animal feed. Selenium is an essential trace element in animals. It has many biological functions. The role of selenium in the body is mainly orchestrated by selenoprotein. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) also exists widely in the body and has attracted much attention due to its high antioxidant capacity. In order to explore the effect of the GPx1 gene on toxicity of DON, in this study, we overexpressed or knockdown GPx1 in porcine splenic lymphocytes, then added different concentrations of DON (0.1025, 0.205, 0.41, and 0.82 mu g/mL) and sodium selenite (2 mu mol/L) to the culture system. Using various techniques, we detected antioxidant function, free radical content, cell apoptosis, and methylation-related gene expression to explore the effect of GPx1 expression on DON-induced cell damage. We also explored whether selenium can antagonize the toxicity of DON in these two cell models and revealed the protective effect of sodium selenite on DON-induced cell damage in GPx1-overexpressing or knockdown splenic lymphocytes. Finally, our findings revealed the following: (1) GPx1 can regulate the antioxidant capacity, apoptosis rate, and expression of DNA methylation-related genes in pig splenic lymphocytes. (2) Na2SeO3 (2 mu mol/L) can regulate the antioxidant capacity, apoptosis rate, and expression of DNA methylation-related genes in pig splenic lymphocytes, and this effect is more significant in GPx1-overexpressing cells than in GPx1-knockdown cells. (3) DON can cause oxidative damage, apoptosis, and methylation injury in GPx1-overexpressing or knockdown pig splenic lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. (4) Na2SeO3 (2 mu mol/L) can antagonize the toxic effect of DON on GPx1-overexpressing or knockdown pig splenic lymphocytes. Our findings may have important implications for food/feed safety, human health, and environmental protection.

TI Multi-Scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm With Truncated Mean

ID FIREWORKS ALGORITHM
AB A multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) is a quantum population-based algorithm proposed recently. It utilizes the quantum wave function to locate the global optimum of a global numerical optimization problem. As the MQHOA employs the elitism to replace the worst particle in each iteration cycle, it reduces one of the particles in each run, which will cripple the diversity of the population and slow down the convergence speed. Therefore, the particles will be easily trapped into local optima. In this paper, we suggest a new MQHOA with truncated mean stabilization (TS-MQHOA) policy to alleviate the above-mentioned problems. The theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that the truncated mean stabilization strategy helps to diversify the populations and improve the convergence efficiency. The proposed TS-MQHOA is evaluated on a number of dimensionwise unimodal and multimodal CEC benchmark functions, and the computational results are compared with several popular population-based algorithms. The experimental results on complex test problems demonstrate that the proposed TS-MQHOA, in most function evaluations, is able to obtain better convergence toward the global optimum compared with several renowned heuristic algorithms based on swarm intelligence. Meanwhile, the comparative results reveal the competitiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm, especially on high-dimensional function evaluations.

AB This study determined the effect of different lipid sources on growth, feed use, lipid metabolism and antioxidant status of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Juvenile fish (56.9 +/- 4.7 g) were divided into four triplicate groups and fed diets containing 30 g/Kg of fish oil (FO), olive oil (OO), peanut oil (PO) and linseed oil (LO), respectively, for 60 days. Weight gain and feed conversion ratio were not significantly different between the dietary groups, but we observed changes in the fatty acid composition of muscle and intraperitoneal fat reflecting the fatty acid profile of the dietary lipid source. In the hepatopancreas, the highest mRNA level of fatty acid translocase CD36 (FAT/CD36) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT-1A) was both observed in the FO group. In muscle, the expression of FAT/CD36 and CPT-1A in the LO group was significantly higher than that in other groups, except for CPT-1A in the PO group. In addition, the lowest and highest content of malondialdehyde in serum was observed in OO and FO groups, respectively. In summary, dietary lipid source altered the fatty acid composition, potential uptake (FAT/CD36) and oxidation (CPT-1A) of fatty acids, and antioxidant status of grass carp, which should be considered when selecting a lipid source.

The prepared materials were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and vibrating sample magnetometry. This self-assembled nanosystem acted as an efficient magnetically recyclable noble metal-based multifunctional nanocatalyst. It showed excellent catalytic activity and stability for the Heck reaction of iodobenzene and styrene under mild conditions. The methods used to prepare the Pd-Fe3O4 catalysts were simple and low-cost, which will be useful for the large-scale development and application of a magnetically recoverable Pd catalyst.

TI A Clone Selection Based Real-Valued Negative Selection Algorithm
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Excessive detectors, high time complexity, and loopholes are main problems which current negative selection algorithms have face and greatly limit the practical applications of negative selection algorithms. This paper proposes a real-valued negative selection algorithm based on clonal selection. Firstly, the algorithm analyzes the space distribution of the self set and gets the set of outlier selves and several classification clusters. Then, the algorithm considers centers of clusters as antigens, randomly generates initial immune cell population in the qualified range, and executes the clonal selection algorithm. Afterwards, the algorithm changes the limited range to continue the iteration until the non-self space coverage rate meets expectations. After the algorithm terminates, mature detector set and boundary self set are obtained. The main contributions lie in (1) introducing the clonal selection algorithm and randomly generating candidate detectors within the stratified limited ranges based on clustering centers of self set; generating big-radius candidate detectors first and making them cover space far from selves, which reduces the number of detectors; then generating small-radius candidate detectors and making them gradually cover boundary space between selves and non-selves, which reduces the number of holes; (2) distinguishing selves and dividing them into outlier selves, boundary selves, and internal selves, which can adapt to the interference of noise data from selves; (3) for anomaly detection, using mature detector set and boundary self set to test at the same time, which can effectively improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the algorithm has better time efficiency and detector generation quality according to classic negative selection algorithms.

AB Gentiana crassicaulis Duthie ex Burk. and Gentiana macrophylla Pall. are two main sources of Radix Gentianae Macrophyllae (Qinjiao) available in markets, which has a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects and has been extensively used for fighting rheumatoid arthritis. However, they vary in terms of chemical compositions, pharmacological activities, and biomass. In this study, a combined chemical and genetic (HPLC and DNA barcoding) approach was used to compare these two plants. Four predominant bioactive compounds, namely, gentiopicroside, loganic acid, swertiamarin, and sweroside, were used to assess the chemical variations. Based on chemical variations, 15 samples were clustered into two groups through PCA analyses. DNA barcoding utilizing the variable nuclear ITS2 regions were sequenced, aligned, and compared. Together with 61 sequences collected from GenBank, 76 batches of Qinjiao were clustered in two groups according to species origin. The genetic relationships indicated by the ITS2-based NJ tree were consistent with the chemical variations. Thus, the chemical profiles determined by HPLC and DNA profiles obtained from ITS2 region could be applied for the quality control of Qinjiao.

AB This paper addresses the links between three stabilities (attractivity, asymptotic stability, and exponential stability) of switched homogeneous systems with delays and uncertainties. A system has a certain property over a given set S of switching signals if the property holds for all switching signals in S. It is shown that a switched homogeneous system of degree one is exponentially stable over a given set of switching signals if it is attractive or asymptotically stable over the same set. The result is then applied to switched linear systems with delays and uncertainties. Finally, an example follows to show that 'being over a given set of switching signals' is necessary to guarantee the equivalence between different stabilities.

AB Explosive determination is of great importance in national defense and security fields. Simple, quick and reliable analytical techniques have been highly demanded in the field. In this work, we proposed a novel method for simultaneous determination of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and 2,4,6-trinaitrotolunene (TNT) in binary-component polymer bonded explosive (PBX) samples by means of a combination of ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometry with multivariable calibration methods. An orthogonal array design (DAD) was employed to construct the calibration set, which contains 27 reference samples. The calibration models were constructed using Partial Least Square regression (PLS-1) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The variables were selected by the Successive Projection Algorithm (SPA) in MLR model. The predictive ability of the optimized models was validated by a test set including 18 samples. Finally, the two optimized models were successfully applied to simultaneously determine the content of PEN, RDX and TNT in five real binary-component PBX samples. Satisfactory results were obtained for the two models, in which the recovery yields were close to 100% for all the analytes. The computed elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) further shows that the two models have no proportional and constant errors in the predicted concentrations. In addition, the statistical analysis indicates that MLR model with reasonable variable selection (SPA-MLR) could exhibit a slight superiority toward PLS-1 in the system. In a word, UV-spectroscopy in combination with multivariable calibration techniques has high potential to be a simple, quick and accurate analysis method for explosive determination in practice.

AB This experiment was conducted to determine the efficacy of Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134, in different energy and crude protein density diets on ileal amino acid digestibility and intestinal microbial shedding in finishing pigs. Twelve finishing barrows (initial body weight = 75.1 +/- 3.44 kg) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and arranged in a triplicate 4 x 4 Latin square design with four diets and four periods. Diets were formulated with two levels of nutrient density (high energy: 14.6 MJ/kg ME or low energy: 14.2 MJ/kg ME) and two levels of probiotic (0 or 1.0 x 10(9) cfu/kg diet). The coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility (CAID) of crude protein (CP), gross energy (GE), and most of the indispensable amino acids (AA) except for His-Phe and Val were increased (P<0.05) by 5.3%, 6.0%, and 5.2-7.2% in pigs fed the E. faecium compared with non-supplemented groups. The CAID of Cys and Gly was 6.2% and 7.0% greater (P<0.05) in E. faecium groups than non-supplemental groups. Heal and fecal Lactobacilli counts were increased (P<0.05) by 19.9% and 16.6%, and Escherichia coli counts were decreased (P<0.05) by 8.9% and 9.5% in pigs fed the diets supplemented with probiotic, respectively. The CAID of CP, Lys-Met-Thr-Leu-Ile-Cys-Gly as well as the lactobacilli counts were increased in both E. faecium treatments, but values were increased higher in the high density diet. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 1.0 x 10(9) cfu/kg of E. faecium DSM 7134 exerted beneficial effects on the CAID of CP and AA and intestinal lactobacilli shedding, especially was administrated in high energy and crude protein density diets.

AB Ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) were supported on the interior surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different inner diameters to study the effects of CNT channel size on the cellobiose conversion. It was found that the reducibility and catalytic activity of Ru/CNT-in sample was enhanced with the decrease of the carbon channel size and Ru/CNTs-in catalysts showed significantly higher catalytic activities than that of the Ru/CNTs-out sample. The confinement effect of the CNT channel was gradually enhanced with the decrease of the nanotube channel size (inner diameter). The encapsulation of Ru NPs inside the CNT channels improved the Ru reducibility and decreased the leaching of catalytic sites.

AB Non-starch polysaccharides can improve the undesirable properties of starch. In this study, we prepared a gel composite system using arabinoxylan (AX), nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), and wheat starch (WS) to simulate the effects of the interaction between AX and cellulose in the wheat cell wall on the gelatinization properties and digestion of WS. The results indicated that the addition of AX and NFC increased the hardness and viscosity of gelatinized starch compared with the control, with the AX-10%NFC showing the highest gel strength. Structural characterization indicated that increasing the content of NFC facilitated the formation of a homogeneous network in the starch gel, and concurrently enhanced intermolecular associations between starch molecules. Additionally, the R1050/1020 (the ratio of absorbance at 1050 cm-1 to 1020 cm-1 in FTIR) showed that the AX-10%NFC significantly enhanced the short-range order of starch. Moreover, the addition of AX and NFC effectively decreased the digestibility of starch. After 180 min of enzymatic hydrolysis, AX-10%NFC exhibited the lowest hydrolysis rate, which was 12.01 % lower than that of the control. This study investigated the AX-NFC interactions impacting starch characteristics, providing mechanistic insights into modulating starch gelatinization properties and facilitating the development of slow-digesting functional foods.

AB In the context of restoring desertified grassland vegetation, elucidating the intricate composition and stability of soil aggregates, coupled with the essential stoichiometric attributes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), is vital for assessing the intricate soil biogeochemical processes and ecosystem services. However, previous research has predominantly focused on the characteristics of grassland vegetation communities, soil physicochemical factors, and their interrelationships, with limited studies on the properties of C, N, and P stoichiometry. This study examined four desertified grasslands with varying restoration periods (10a, 14a, 20a, and 40a) to assess the long-term restoration effects on soil aggregates and aggregate-associated nutrient stoichiometry in eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. The results showed that as the restoration period progressed, plant diversity and vegetation coverage increased accordingly. The contents of soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN), and total P (TP) in soil aggregates of various depths and sizes, especially in the macroaggregates, gradually increased and peaked after 20 years of restoration. Conversely, the contents of microaggregates and clay-silt fractions generally exhibited a downward trend. After two decades, the desertified grassland's soil aggregates achieved an optimal level of stability. Furthermore, the vegetation restoration resulted in notable changes in soil aggregateassociated C, N, and P stoichiometric of desertified grassland. A marked strong correlation was observed between the composition and stability of soil aggregates and the stoichiometric characteristics of these essential nutrients, with the macroaggregate mass ratio showing a positive relationship with aggregate stability.

AB Different chicken breeds exhibit distinct muscle phenotypes resulting from selective breeding, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenotypic difference. Skeletal muscle is composed of a large number of heterogeneous cell populations. Differences in differentiation and interaction of cell populations play a key role in the difference of skeletal muscle phenotype. In the current study, we performed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the leg muscle of Daheng broiler (DH, cultivated breed) and Tibetan chicken (TC, native breed) at embryonic (E) 10, E14 and E18. A comprehensive cell atlas of embryonic chicken skeletal muscle, consisting of 29,579 high-quality cells representing 6 distinct cell types was built. The differentiation trajectory of Myoblasts and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) was constructed through pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. Our results revealed the different developmental trajectories and dynamic gene expression profiles in 3 subtypes of myoblasts and 5 FAPs subtypes of the two chicken breeds. Tibetan chicken showed earlier embryonic myogenesis and less myoblasts compared with Daheng broiler. By comparing the switch status and switch time of genes in the two breeds, SNRPG,SNRPE,EIF4EBP1 and HSP90AB1 were considered as potentially critical genes for embryonic myogenesis, and the genes MYOG,MYBPH,APOA1, and MGP played dominant roles in the embryonic adipogenesis. Intercellular interaction networks showed that strong and complex intercellular communication was contained during embryonic skeletal muscle growth and development. These findings revealed the differences of molecular mechanisms in the skeletal muscle development between TC and DH chickens. Our data provide a better understanding of skeletal muscle developmental differences between cultivated and native breeds and valuable information for genetic breeding of chicken.

AB Using metagenomics, GC-MS, non-targeted metabolomics, and metatranscriptomics, we investigated the microbial communities and metabolites in two different Lactobacillus plantarum fermentations. Metagenomics revealed Weissella cibaria dominantly contributed to the DACN766-fermented suansun (LPS1) and Lactiplantibacillus pentosus to the DACN760-fermented suansun (LPS2). GC-MS identified 38 and 40 flavor compounds in LPS1 and LPS2, respectively, with p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, acetic acid, hexanal, and propionic acid crucial for aroma development. LPS2 exhibited higher levels of p-cresol and acetic acid, contributing to its stronger sour and pungent flavors, which was achieved by regulating many metabolisms like glycolysis and tyrosine metabolism. In contrast, Weissella cibaria plays a role in mitigating off-flavors, resulting in a milder flavor profile in LPS1. Non-targeted metabolomics indicated 70.78% of differential metabolites were upregulated in LPS1. Conversely, the elevated expression of tryptophan and tyrosine underscores the more pronounced sour and odor-producing characteristics observed in LPS2. Metatranscriptomics highlighted the regulation of genes like XFA, XFT, and XFM, which inhibit the formation of the precursors of p-cresol and indole in LPS2. This integrated multi-omics analysis provides deep insights into the fermentation dynamics, facilitating the targeted selection of Lactobacillus plantarum strains with flavor-regulating capabilities.

AB Available evidence suggests that dynamic functional connectivity can capture time-varying abnormalities in brain activity in resting-state cerebral functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data and has a natural advantage in uncovering mechanisms of abnormal brain activity in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Hence, an advanced dynamic brain network analysis model called the temporal brain category graph convolutional network (Temporal-BCGCN) was employed. Firstly, a unique dynamic brain network analysis module, DSF-BrainNet, was designed to construct dynamic synchronization features. Subsequently, a revolutionary graph convolution method, TemporalConv, was proposed based on the synchronous temporal properties of features. Finally, the first modular test tool for abnormal hemispherical lateralization in deep learning based on rs-fMRI data, named CategoryPool, was proposed. This study was validated on COBRE and UCLA datasets and achieved 83.62% and 89.71% average accuracies, respectively, outperforming the baseline model and other state-of-the-art methods. The ablation results also demonstrate the advantages of TemporalConv over the traditional edge feature graph convolution approach and the improvement of CategoryPool over the classical graph pooling approach. Interestingly, this study showed that the lower-order perceptual system and higher-order network regions in the left hemisphere are more severely dysfunctional than in the right hemisphere in SZ, reaffirmings the importance of the left medial superior frontal gyrus in SZ. Our code was available at: https://github.com/swfen/Temporal-BCGCN.

AB Peatlands are globally important carbon sinks but are frequently drained. Drainage activities reduce overall methane emissions; however they are often accompanied by the construction of ditches, which are potential methane emission hotspots. Yet, the offsets of methane emissions from creating ditches in peatlands under different climate zones and land-use types remain unclear. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis by compiling annual methane emissions from paired near-pristine peatlands and terrestrial portion of drained peatlands and ditches to address this issue. Results showed that ditches occupy approximately 3.8 (95% confidence interval: 3.1 similar to 4.4)% of all drained peatlands. Ditches emit 695 (511 similar to 898) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) methane overall, with the highest emissions observed in (sub)tropics. Globally, ditch emissions offset approximately 12 (10 similar to 14)% for reductions in methane emissions from peatland drainage. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including ditch methane emissions to quantify emission factors for regional to global peatlands affected by drainage.

AB Corporate digital transformation is a significant path for industrial upgrading and sustainable development. This study employs China's accelerated depreciation (AD) policy as a quasi-natural experiment to explore the impacts of tax incentives on the digital transformation of enterprises. Using panel data of China's listed companies from 2010 to 2019, we find that AD policy significantly promotes firms to engage in digitization practices through the channels of firm investment and firm innovation. We also find that the policy effects are more pronounced for firms with a higher level of digitization, firms with stronger financial constraints, non-state-owned enterprises, and firms located in East China. Moreover, we also present a positive relationship betweendigital transformation and firm performance. Our study supplements the literature on the determinants of digital transformation and provides insights into how tax policy shapes firms' incentives to be more digitized.

ID IMPACT
AB Arginine (Arg), a safe basic amino acid, modulates interprotein interactions and impacts the processing characteristics of myofibrillar proteins (MP) in meat products, as numerous studies have demonstrated. This study aimed to explore the effects of varying concentrations of Arg (0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.200 %) on the physicochemical properties and gel behavior of yak MP. Utilizing yak MP as the substrate, we assessed and analyzed the physicochemical attributes and gel performance of the MP-Arg composite system. The findings revealed that Arg facilitates MP unfolding and internal group exposure, effectively mitigating oxidative tertiary structure alterations. Arg exerts potent antioxidant activity on MP, augmenting their water-holding capacity, which ameliorates gel properties. In this experiment, 0.05 % Arg maximally inhibited oxidative damage to MP, with protection being concentration-dependent. Collectively, these findings suggest that Arg effectively inhibits the oxidative degradation of MP structure and promotes the formation of enhanced gel characteristics.

AB Ammonia, a common toxic gas, posed a hazard to both human and chickens. The Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle, helped maintain the internal environment of the organism and supported the protein foundation for the endoplasmic reticulum to be involved in pyroptosis. Thus, the Golgi apparatus has garnered significant attention. The purpose of our research was to explore the mechanisms of Golgin A7 (Golga7) involved in pyroptosis after chicken exposure to ammonia. To reach our goal, we first created an in vitro ammonia model to study the effect of ammonia on chicken splenic lymphocyte pyroptosis. Then, leveraging this model, we established Golga7 and miR-32-5p knockdown and overexpression models to investigate their roles in ammoniainduced pyroptosis. We found the ultrastructural changes in the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria of chicken splenic lymphocytes exposure to ammonia. The damage of mitochondria increased the level of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which caused the down-regulation of miR-32-5p. The miR-32-5p inhibitor increased the expression of Golga7 and pyroptosis-related genes (NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), Cysteine aspartase-1 (Caspase-1), Golgin A3 (Golga3), Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)), which induced the pyroptosis, but when miR-32-5p mimic/si-Golga7 (Golga7 inhibitor) was utilized, these effects were reduced. Our research demonstrated that miR-32-5p/Golga7 regulated NLRP3 involving in the pyroptosis of chicken splenic cells exposed to ammonia. Our study provided a valuable foundation for the prevention and treatment chickens ammonia poisoning in the livestock production.

TI Relaxor induced performance tuning around morphotropic phase boundary in
   Ba0.86Sr0.14Ti0.94Sn0.06
   modified BNT-based ceramics
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
LA English
DT Article
AB BNT-based piezoelectric ceramics exhibit excellent electrical properties at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) with a pivotal relaxation structure. Here, a MPB containing R (R3c) and T phases (P4bm) is formed via inducing Ba0.86Sr0.14Ti0.94Sn0.06O3 in BNT ceramics. Then, lowered polarization anisotropy is produced with many possible polarization directions, which is beneficial for high piezoelectric performance. In particular, an optimized and stabile piezoelectric constant (d(33) = 182 pC N-1) is gained with a dominating R and lesser T phase below the depolarization temperature (Tf-r) due to high ferroelectricity. A large strain (S-uni = 0.426%) is observed when the T phase is dominant due to the transformation from a nonergodic relaxor (NR) to ergodic relaxor (ER) phase along with double-hysteresis loops while Tf-r drops to room temperature. Due to the easily switched domain of the ER phase, an improvement in temperature stability and an increase is revealed for strain under the thermal field and electric field, respectively. Thus, this article elaborates on the performance within the MPB region with a changed relaxor structure, promoting the further development of lead-free piezoelectric ceramic materials.

TI Livestock turnover and dynamic livestock carrying capacity are crucial

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

ID STOCKING RATE; SYSTEMS; DEGRADATION; PROTECTION; REGIONS
AB Alpine grasslands are distributed widely on high-elevated ranges and plateaus from the wet tropics to polar regions, accounting for approximately 3% of the world's land area. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is the highest and largest plateau in the world, and approximately 60% of the plateau consists of alpine grassland, which is used mainly for grazing animals. Livestock structure was determined in Guinan (GN), Yushu (YS) and Maqu counties (MQ) on the QTP by interviewing 235 local pastoralists. Based on data collected from GN, the livestock carrying capacity was calculated using herbage dry matter biomass intake (LCCm) by the livestock, and the metabolizable energy yield (LCCe) and digestible crude protein (LCCp) available in pasture. The pasture area per household differed among the regions of the QTP, which was the main reason for the difference in livestock stocking rate. The householders raised the appropriate proportion of breeding females and young yaks and sheep in GN and MQ, but not in YS, to maintain a constant turnover. Most pasture in YS was used at the community level, especially in summer. The calculated carrying capacities based on metabolizable energy yield (LCCe) of the pasture and dry matter biomass (LCCm) were similar in most months except for August, when the value of LCCe was higher than LCCm. Based on the digestible protein of the pasture, the calculated livestock carrying capacity overestimated the actual carrying capacity during the herbage growing season from May to September. Appropriate practices should be taken in different regions of QTP, such as providing supplementary feed, especially protein, during the forage non-growing season. Livestock carrying capacity should be adjusted dynamically, and calculated by a number of parameters. The stocking rate should be controlled to optimize livestock production and curb or minimize grassland degradation to generate a sustainable system. This study examined the grasslands and LCC on the QTP, but the results could be applied to grasslands worldwide.

DE Carbon dots; Oxygen reduction reaction; Catalyst; Co-doped
ID POROUS CARBON; CATALYST; PERFORMANCE
AB The carbon-based catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic and stable performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which are expected to replace expensive and scarce Pt-based catalysts. However, how to regulate the interaction between silver and carrier carbon dots (CD) to improve electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and stability, has not been systematically studied. In this study, we in-situ synthesized fluorine and nitrogen co-doped CD anchoring Ag nanoparticles by UV irradiation reduction method. The peak potential, onset-potential and half-wave potential of F, N-CD@Ag-0.1 are 0.85 V, 1.056 V, and 0.9 V, respectively, indicating outstanding ORR performance. The current density of F, N-CD@Ag-0.1 remains 97.5 % after 50, 000 s, showing more excellent stability than Pt/C. The impressive ORR catalytic activity and stability of F, N-CD@Ag-0.1 could be attributed to the strong anchoring effect of nitrogen-doped CD on Ag. This effect leads to a significant interaction and charge transfer between Ag and CD, thereby enhancing the charge transfer process during the catalytic reaction. This project aims to design a carbon dot/silver composite catalyst with high ORR catalytic performance and favorable stability. The implementation of this project provides good theoretical guidance for the design of carbon nanomaterial-based catalytic systems.

AB Cold plasma is a nonthermal process used for modification of proteins. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cold plasma technology on the phosphorylation degree, functional and oxidation properties, and structure of casein in sheep milk. Cold plasma treatment for 3-4 min significantly increased the phosphorylation degree and enhanced functional properties, including water-holding capacity, solubility, foaming capacity and stability. Besides, plasma treatment time profoundly influenced protein oxidation, and treatment for 2 and 3 min could be the preferred conditions to minimize protein change. The protein conformation became unstable with the extension of treatment time. Particle size, polymer dispersity index, and microscopy images confirmed alterations in the protein structure following 3 min of processing. Consequently, using cold plasma treatment at 10 kHz 20 kV for 3 min could be suggested for milk protein modification, providing a basis for the application of high-quality caseins in food processing.

AB The influence of Eleutherine bulbosa (EB) extract at various levels (1, 4, 7, 10 or 13 g/kg) on the myofibrillar protein oxidation and moisture migration of yak meat in Fenton oxidation system was investigated. The results showed that inclusion of EB extract in yak meat efficiently inhibited carbonyl formation triggered by hydroxyl radicals. Supplementation of EB extract at 1 - 10 g/kg manifested more contents of the active sulfhydryl, epsilon -NH 2 groups and alpha -helix structure, and higher solubility of myofibrillar proteins (MPs), but alleviated the turbidity of MPs. However, adding high level of EB extract (13 g/kg) induced the loss of free amine and alpha -helix content and resulted in more aggregation of MPs. The SDS -PAGE demonstrated that adding 1 - 7 g/kg EB extract had an obvious protective effect for myosin heavy chain and actin, whereas 10 or 13 g/kg EB extract led to weakened intensities of protein bands. DSC and LF-NMR analysis revealed that 7 g/kg EB extract had appreciable effects on thermal stabilities of MPs, and improved the hydration of yak meat induced by oxidation, while 13 g/kg EB extract accelerated MP structure destabilization and lowered water retention. Our results suggested that incorporation of low levels of EB extract (1 - 7 g/kg) effectively retarded the oxidative damage to MPs and EB extract could be a promising natural antioxidant in meat processing.

TI Nano-enzyme functionalized hydrogels promote diabetic wound healing
   through immune microenvironment modulation
SO BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Non-healing diabetic wounds often culminate in amputation and mortality. The main pathophysiological features in diabetic wounds involve the accumulation of M1-type macrophages and excessive oxidative stress. In this study, we engineered a nano-enzyme functionalized hydrogel by incorporating a magnesium ion-doped molybdenum-based polymetallic oxide (Mg-POM), a novel bioactive nano-enzyme, into a GelMA hydrogel, to obtain the GelMA@Mg-POM system to enhance diabetic wound healing. GelMA@Mg-POM was crosslinked using UV light, yielding a hydrogel with a uniformly porous three-dimensional mesh structure. In vitro experiments showed that GelMA@Mg-POM extraction significantly enhanced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, scavenged ROS, improved the inflammatory microenvironment, induced macrophage reprogramming towards M2, and promoted HUVEC regeneration of CD31 and fibroblast regeneration of type I collagen. In in vivo experiments, diabetic rat wounds treated with GelMA@Mg-POM displayed enhanced granulation tissue genesis and collagen production, as evidenced by HE and Masson staining. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the ability of GelMA@Mg-POM to mitigate macrophage-associated inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis. Overall, these findings suggest that GelMA@Mg-POM holds significant promise as a biomaterial for treating diabetic wounds.
   GelMA@Mg-POM can clear ROS, regulate the immune microenvironment, and promote wound healing in diabetes.

AB Mixed infectious vaginitis poses a serious threat to female reproductive health due to complex pathogenic factors, a long course and easy recurrence. Currently, antibiotic-based treatment methods are facing a crisis of drug resistance and secondary dysbiosis. Exploring effective drugs for the treatment of mixed vaginitis from Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., a natural traditional Chinese medicine with a long history of medicinal use, is a feasible treatment strategy. P. suffruticosa Andr. leaf extract (PLE) has significant anti-bacterial effects due to its rich content of polyphenols and flavonoids. The polyphenols in peony leaves have the potential to make carboxymethyl chitosan form in situ gel. In the current study, PLE and carboxymethyl chitosan were combined to develop another type of natural anti-bacterial anti-oxidant hydrogel for the treatment of mixed infectious vaginitis. Through a series of characterisations, CP had a three-dimensional network porous structure with good mechanical properties, high water absorption, long retention and a slow-release drug effect. The mixed infectious vaginitis mouse model induced by a mixture of pathogenic bacteria was used to investigate the therapeutic effects of CP in vivo. The appearance of the vagina, H&E colouring of the tissue and inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6) confirm the good anti-vaginal effect of CP. Therefore, CP was expected to become an ideal effective strategy to improve mixed infection vaginitis due to its excellent hydrogel performance and remarkable ability to regulate flora.

AB Background The genetic diversity of yak, a key domestic animal on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), is a vital resource for domestication and breeding efforts. This study presents the first yak pangenome obtained through the de novo assembly of 16 yak genomes.Results We discovered 290 Mb of nonreference sequences and 504 new genes. Our pangenome-wide presence and absence variation (PAV) analysis revealed 5,120 PAV-related genes, highlighting a wide range of variety-specific genes and genes with varying frequencies across yak populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on binary gene PAV data classified yaks into three new groups: wild, domestic, and Jinchuan. Moreover, we proposed a 'two-haplotype genomic hybridization model' for understanding the hybridization patterns among breeds by integrating gene frequency, heterozygosity, and gene PAV data. A gene PAV-GWAS identified a novel gene (BosGru3G009179) that may be associated with the multirib trait in Jinchuan yaks. Furthermore, an integrated transcriptome and pangenome analysis highlighted the significant differences in the expression of core genes and the mutational burden of differentially expressed genes between yaks from high and low altitudes. Transcriptome analysis across multiple species revealed that yaks have the most unique differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (between high- and low-altitude regions), especially in the heart and lungs, when comparing high- and low-altitude adaptations.Conclusions The yak pangenome offers a comprehensive resource and new insights for functional genomic studies, supporting future biological research and breeding strategies.

AB Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn) leaf has abundant rhamnogalacturonan-I enriched pectic polysaccharides, which exert various health -promoting effects. Nevertheless, the potential relationship between the chemical structure and the biological function of pectic polysaccharides from Tartary buckwheat leaves (TBP) remains unclear. Therefore, to bridge the gap between the chemical structure and the biological function of TBP, the impacts of ultrasound -assisted Fenton degradation (UFD) and mild alkaline de-esterification (MAD) on structural properties and biological effects of TBP were systematically studied. Compared with the native TBP (molecular mass, 9.537 x 104 Da), the molecular masses of degraded TBPs (TBP-MMW, 4.811 x 104 Da; TBPLMW, 2.101 x 104 Da) were significantly reduced by the UFD modification, while their primary chemical structures were overall stable. Besides, compared with the native TBP (esterification degree, 22.73 %), the esterification degrees of de-esterified TBPs (TBP-MDE, 14.27 %; TBP-LDE, 6.59 %) were notably reduced by the MAD modification, while their primary chemical structures were also overall stable. Furthermore, the results revealed that both UFD and MAD modifications could significantly improve the antioxidant, antiglycation, and immunostimulatory effects of TBP. Indeed, TBP's biological effects were negatively correlated to its molecular mass and esterification degree, while positively linked to its free uronic acids. The findings demonstrate that both UFD and MAD modifications are promising techniques for the structural modification of TBP, which can remarkedly promote its biological effects. Besides, the present results are conducive to better understanding TBP's structure-bioactivity relationship.

AB Enterococcus faecium B13, selected from fermentation chili, has been proven to promote animal growth by previous studies, but it belongs to opportunistic pathogens, so a comprehensive evaluation of its probiotic properties and safety is necessary. In this study, the probiotic properties and safety of B13 were evaluated at the genetic and phenotype levels in vitro and then confirmed in vivo. The genome of B13 contains one chromosome and two plasmids. The average nucleotide identity indicated that B13 was most closely related to the fermentation-plant-derived strain. The strain does not carry the major virulence genes of the clinical E. faecium strains but contains aac(6 ')-Ii, ant (6)-Ia, msrC genes. The strain had a higher tolerance to acid at pH 3.0, 4.0, and 0.3% bile salt and a 32.83% free radical DPPH clearance rate. It can adhere to Caco-2 cells and reduce the adhesion of E. coli to Caco-2 cells. The safety assessment revealed that the strain showed no hemolysis and did not exhibit gelatinase, ornithine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase, or tryptophanase activity. It was sensitive to twelve antibiotics but was resistant to erythromycin, rifampicin, tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. Experiments in vivo have shown that B13 can be located in the ileum and colon and has no adverse effects on experiment animals. After 28 days of feeding, B13 did not remarkable change the alpha-diversity of the gut flora or increase the virulence genes. Our study demonstrated that E. faecium B13 may be used as a probiotic candidate.

AB Nanomaterials present a vast potential as functional materials in environmental engineering. However, there are challenges with nanocomplex for recyclability, reliable/stable, and scale -up industrial integration. Here, a versatile, low-cost, stable and recycled easily metal-polyphenolic-based material carried by wood powder (bioCarMPNs) adsorption platform was nano -engineered by a simple, fast self -assembly strategy, in which wood powder is an excellent substrate serving as a scaffold and stabilizer to prevent the nanocomplex from aggregating and is easier to recycle. Life cycle analysis highlights a green preparation process and environmental sustainability for bioCar-MPNs. The metal-polyphenolic nanocomplex coated on the wood surface in bioCar-MPNs presents a remarkable surface adsorption property (1829.4 mg/g) at a low cost (2.4 US dollars per 1000 g bioCar-MPNs) for organic dye. Quartz crystal microbalance analysis (QCM) demonstrates an existing strong affinity between polyphenols and organic dyes. Furthermore, Independent Gradient Model (IGM) and Hirshfeld surface analysis reveal the presence of the electrostatic interactions, pi - pi interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, adsorption efficiency of bioCar-MPNs maintains over 95% in the presence of co -existing ions (Na + , 0.5 M). Importantly, the reasonable utilization of biomass for water treatment can contribute to achieving the high -value and resource utilization of biomass materials.

AB Quercetin is a unique bioactive flavonoid, and is an excellent antioxidant and has anti-tumor effects by regulating different tumor-related processes like proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and spread. The latest investigations reveal that quercetin may have the capability to influence DNA methylation modification, one of the primary factors in the development of tumors. Despite the fact that quercetin has significant therapeutic properties, its use as an anti-tumor medicine is constrained by its poor solubility, short half-life, and ineffective tumor targeting. Here, we review the structure and properties of quercetin, its capacity for DNA methylation modification in tumors, and the possibility of nanoscale delivery of quercetin for future tumor treatment.
   Quercetin reverses the expression of abnormal genes by regulating DNA methylation, and is an important regulator of gene transcription in tumorigenesis. The use of nanoscale delivery of quercetin increases its bioavailability in cancer therapy.

ID DISCREPANCY
AB Subsampling or subdata selection is a useful approach in large-scale statistical learning. Most existing studies focus on model-based subsampling methods which significantly depend on the model assumption. In this paper, we consider the model-free subsampling strategy for generating subdata from the original full data. In order to measure the goodness of representation of a subdata with respect to the original data, we propose a criterion, generalized empirical F-discrepancy (GEFD), and study its theoretical properties in connection with the classical generalized L2-discrepancy in the theory of uniform designs. These properties allow us to develop a kind of low-GEFD data-driven subsampling method based on the existing uniform designs. By simulation examples and a real case study, we show that the proposed subsampling method is superior to the random sampling method. Moreover, our method keeps robust under diverse model specifications while other popular subsampling methods are under-performing. In practice, such a model-free property is more appealing than the model-based subsampling methods, where the latter may have poor performance when the model is misspecified, as demonstrated in our simulation studies.

AB In recent years, the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), which is widely farmed in China, has been frequently affected by Hepatospora eriocheir. The gut response of mitten crabs to H. eriocheir infection is not yet known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of H. eriocheir infection on the gut microbiota and proteome of E. sinensis. In this study, E. sinensis was divided into two groups based on whether it was infected with H. eriocheir using PCR and Calcofluor white staining. Calcofluor white staining revealed that H. eriocheir was massively aggregated in the gut. Proteomic results showed that 3959 proteins were identified. Under a 1.2 -fold change threshold, 420 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened, including 292 upregulated DEPs and 128 downregulated DEPs. Differential protein expression related to apoptosis and energy metabolism increased, while protein expression related to immune and inflammatory responses and cell motility decreased. In addition, the microbiota results showed that alpha diversity tended to increase, and beta diversity indicated significant differences in gut microbiota between the two groups. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the E. sinensis gut. Compared with the control group, Bacteroidetes were significantly reduced in the infected group, while Firmicutes and Tenericutes were significantly increased. At the genus level, the abundance of Bacteroides, Flavobacterium, Shewanella and Aeromonas decreased significantly, while Candidatus Bacilloplasma, Dysgonomonas, Tyzzerella_3 and Lactovum increased significantly. Microbial function prediction found that most differentially abundant bacteria were related to metabolism. At the same time, correlation analysis between the proteome and gut microbiota found potential roles of differential bacteria and proteins involved in metabolism and immunity. These findings suggest that H. eriocheir infection can alter the gut microbiota composition and proteome of E. sinensis.

AB Capsaicin stress, along with salt stress, could be considered the main stressors for lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented pepper products. Until now, insufficient attention has been paid to salt stress, while the effect of capsaicin on the aroma-producing properties of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) is unclear. The present study attempted to illustrate the effect of capsaicin stress on the aroma-producing properties of L. plantarum CL-01 isolated from traditionally fermented peppers based on E-nose and GC-IMS. The results showed that E-nose could clearly distinguish the overall flavor differences of L. plantarum CL-01 under capsaicin stress. A total of 48 volatile compounds (VOCs) were characterized by means of GC-IMS, and the main VOCs belonged to acids and alcohols. Capsaicin stress significantly promoted L. plantarum CL-01 to produce alpha-pinene, ethyl crotonate, isobutyric acid, trans-2-pentenal, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, 1-penten-3-one, 2-pentanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol-D, and 2-heptanone (p < 0.05). In addition, under capsaicin stress, the contents of 1-penten-3-one, 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol, 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol, isobutanol, 2-furanmethanethiol, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, 1-propanethiol, diethyl malonate, acetic acid, beta-myrcene, 2-pentanone, ethyl acetate, trans-2-pentenal, 2-methylbutyl acetate, and 2-heptanone produced by L. plantarum CL-01 were significantly increased along with the fermentation time (p < 0.05). Furthermore, some significant correlations were observed between the response values of specific E-nose sensors and effective VOCs.

AB Selenite is widely used to increase Selenium (Se) content in cereals, however excessive selenite may be toxic to plant growth. In this study, barley was malted to elucidate the action mechanism of selenite in the generation and detoxification of oxidative toxicity. The results showed that high doses (600 mu M) of selenite radically increased oxidative stress by the elevated accumulation of superoxide and malondialdehyde, leading to phenotypic symptoms of selenite-induced toxicity like stunted growth. Barley tolerates selenite through a combination of mechanisms, including altering Se distribution in barley, accelerating Se efflux, and increasing the activity of some essential antioxidant enzymes. Low doses (150 mu M) of selenite improved barley biomass, respiratory rate, root vigor, and maintained the steady-state equilibrium between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme. Selenite-induced proline may act as a biosignal to mediate the response of barley to Se stress. Furthermore, low doses of selenite increased the glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA) concentrations by mediating the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (AsA-GSH cycle). GSH intervention and dimethyl selenide volatilization appear to be the primary mechanisms of selenite tolerance in barley. Thus, results from this study will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of selenite tolerance in crops.

AB The concentration of intramuscular fat (IMF) is a crucial determinant of yak meat quality. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate IMF in yak remain largely elusive. In our study, we conducted transcriptome sequencing on the longissimus dorsi muscle tissues of yaks with varying IMF contents. We then filtered differentially expressed genes (DEGs), microRNAs (DEMs), and long non-coding RNAs (DELs) to elucidate potential regulatory pathways of adipogenesis in yaks. Overall, our research sheds light on an array of potential mRNAs and noncoding RNAs implicated in IMF deposition and elaborates on the role of HIF1 alpha in yaks. These findings contribute valuable insights that can serve as a guide for further research into the molecular mechanisms governing IMF deposition.

AB Postmortem meat tenderization is a process mediated by a series of biochemical reactions related to muscle cell death. Cell death is considered a sign that muscle has started to transform into meat. Mitochondria play a significant role in regulating and executing cell death, as they are an aggregation point for many cell death signals and are also the primary target organelle damaged by tissue anoxia. Mitochondrial damage is likely to have an expanded role in postmortem meat tenderization. This review presents current findings on mitochondrial damage induced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species during postmortem anaerobic metabolism and on the impact of mitochondrial damage on proteolysis and discusses how this leads to improved tenderness during aging. The underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation of postmortem muscle tenderization likely focus on the mitochondria's role in postmortem cell death and energy metabolism. The death process of postmortem skeletal muscle cells may exhibit multiple types, possibly involving transformation from autophagy to apoptosis and, ultimately, necroptosis or necrosis. Mitochondrial characteristics, especially membrane integrity and ATP-related compound levels, are closely related to the transformation of multiple types of dead postmortem muscle cells. Finally, a possible biochemical regulatory network in postmortem muscle tenderization is proposed.

AB As one of the most important livestock breeds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Tibetan sheep are of great importance to the local economy, agriculture and culture. Its adaptive mechanism in low temperature and low oxygen at highland altitudes has not been reported. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and muscle tissue of sheep at low and highland altitudes. LOC101112291, SELENOW, COL3A1, GPX1, TMSB4X and HSF4 were selected as candidate genes for adapting to plateau characteristics in Tibet Sheep. Besides, glutathione metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, nucleotide excision repair, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, protein digestion and absorption, thyroid hormone synthesis, relaxation signaling pathways may play important roles in the adaptation to plateau hypoxia, and cold tolerance. Structural analysis also showed that sequencing genes related to the adaptation mechanism of Tibet sheep to highland altitude. This study will lay a certain foundation for Tibet sheep research.
   Tibet sheep are an ancient species in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. After a long period of domestication. Tibet sheep adapt to the hypoxic environment of the plateau in terms of physiology and morphology. At the same time, Tibet sheep is also one of the major sources of material for herdsmen in tibetan. In this study, six different tissue samples (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and muscle) of Tibet sheep were analyzed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of different tissues respond to hypothermia condition. The results showed that six key genes and eight important signaling pathways involved in regulating the adaptation of Tibet sheep to the plateau. In addition, there were more alternative splicing (AS) events and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in highland altitude Tibet sheep than in lowland altitude sheep, which was also a concern in the highland altitude adaptability of Tibet sheep.

AB In this work, mussel-inspired surface functionalization of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were coated by in situ self-polymerization of polydopamine (PDA) to synthesize core-shell structural composites (HNTs@PDA), and then incorporated into polyarylene ether nitrile (PEN) matrix. Due to the strong adhesion of the PDA modification layer and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar nitrile group of PEN and the catechol group of PDA, the dispersion and interfacial compatibility of HNTs@PDA in the PEN matrix are improved. The results show that the dielectric constant of PEN/HNTs@PDA 20 nanocomposites reaches 11.56 (1 kHz), which is 3.2 times that of pure PEN. In addition, after heat treatment, a chemical cross-linking reaction occurred between the PEN matrix to form a cross-linked PEN (CPEN) based nanocomposites, which further improved the thermal stability of the nanocomposites. The results show that the T (g) of CPEN/HNTs@PDA 20 nanocomposites reaches 215.5(degrees)C, which is 47.7(degrees)C higher than that of PEN/HNTs@PDA 20. Moreover, the dielectric constant-temperature coefficient of all CPEN nanocomposites is less than 7 x 10(-4 degrees)C(-1) at the temperature range of 25-180(degrees)C. All in all, this work provides a simple and environmentally friendly strategy to adjust the dielectric properties of polymer-based ceramic nanocomposites, which provides a pathway for its application as a dielectric material in the film capacitors field.

AB Introduction: The Gelao ethnic minority of northern Guizhou, China have long possessed extensive traditional knowledge of medicinal herbs. This ethnobotanical study aimed to document and evaluate wild plants used medicinally by the Gelao people, providing insights into their traditional medicine and knowledge systems.Methods: Field research was conducted in Gelao communities of Daozhen, Wuchuan and Zheng'an counties using interviews, surveys and participatory rural appraisal.Results: Quantitative ethnobotanical indices were utilized to assess the cultural significance of 187 herbs identified. The herbs belonged to 84 families, primarily Compositae, and were mostly roots, rhizomes and whole plants. They were used to treat digestive, respiratory and inflammatory disorders, gynecological diseases, bites and other conditions, mainly through decoctions. 25 highly significant herbs (national plant cultural significance index > 1000) were known to protect health. Some function as food and are considered safe. However, the study revealed issues including a declining number of knowledgeable elders and inadequate hygiene controls.Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the Gelao's extensive medicinal plant knowledge and highlight the need for further ethnobotanical research to document and preserve this culturally important tradition. The identified herbs also represent an alternative medicinal resource with potential modern applications pending further investigation of their pharmacology and sustainable use. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into Gelao ethnobotanical knowledge and the potential of indigenous medicine for modern healthcare.

AB Proteus mirabilis, a naturally resistant zoonotic bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, has exhibited an alarming increase in drug resistance. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore alternative antimicrobial agents. Bacteriophages, viruses that selectively target bacteria, are abundant in the natural environment and have demonstrated potential as a promising alternative to antibiotics. In this study, we successfully isolated four strains of Proteus mirabilis phages from sewage obtained from a chicken farm in Sichuan, China. Subsequently, we characterized one of the most potent lytic phages, Q29, by examining its biological and genomic features. Comparative genomic analysis revealed the functional genes and phylogenetic evolution of Q29 phages. Our findings revealed that Proteus mirabilis bacteriophage Q29 possesses an icosahedral symmetrical head with a diameter of 95 nm and a tail length of 240 nm. Moreover, phage Q29 exhibited stability within a temperature range of 37 celcius to 55 celcius and under pH conditions ranging from 4 to 9. The optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) for this phage was determined to be 0.001. Furthermore, the one-step growth curve results indicated an incubation period of approximately 15 min, an outbreak period of approximately 35 min, and an average cleavage quantity of approximately 60 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell. The genome of phage Q29 was found to have a total length of 58,664 base pairs and encoded 335 open reading frames (ORFs) without carrying any antibiotic resistance genes. Additionally, genetic evolutionary analysis classified phage Q29 within the family Caudalidae and the genus Myotail. This study provides valuable research material for further development of Proteus mirabilis bacteriophage biologics as promising alternatives to antibiotics, particularly in light of the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance posed by this bacterium.

However, influence of shrub encroachment on microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) limitations remains unclear. Using the extracellular enzyme stoichiometry model, microbial nutrition limitations in bulk and rhizosphere soils at various soil layers were investigated at non-shrub alpine grasslands (GL) and shrub-encroached alpine grasslands including Spiraea alpina lands (SA), Caragana microphylla lands (CM) and Potentilla fruticosa lands (PF) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We determined C-acquisition (beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG); beta-D-fibrinosidase (CBH)), N-acquisition (beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG); leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)) and phosphorus (P)-acquisition (acid phosphatase (AP)) enzyme activities. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) in top- and sub-soils significantly increased following shrub encroachment. Interestingly, (LAP + NAG) activities in subsoil increased following shrub encroachment. EC: N in subsoil decreased following shrub encroachment. Microbial C and N limitations were found in shrub-encroached and non-shrub alpine grasslands. Furthermore, microbial C and N limitations in bulk topsoil layers decreased following shrub encroachment. Microbial N limitations in subsoil decreased following shrub encroachment. This result indicates that shrub encroachment mitigated microbial C and N limitations. The limitations were gradually mitigated following shrub encroachment, which led to the decrease of the decomposition rate of organic carbon by microorganisms, indicating shrub encroachment might potentially contribute to SOC storage. In addition, the structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that increases of SOC and NH4+-N in top- and subsoils under shrub encroachment could mitigate microbial C and N limitations, respectively. This study provides available information on the environmental variables affecting the stoichiometry of extracellular enzymes following shrub encroachment, and the theoretical basis for the study of C and N cycling in alpine grasslands.

AB With the progress of urbanization in China, the energy-saving renovation of a large number of existing buildings, especially old buildings, has become an important project for the green and low-carbon development of urban renewal. This paper takes the old brick school building in a university in Chengdu as an example. Through field research, the existing problems of the building are analyzed in detail in terms of building function, structure and appearance, and a detailed plan for functional upgrading, structural reinforcement and facade renovation is drawn up, taking into account the actual requirements and environmental status. In addition, solar photovoltaic technology is integrated into the renovation of the building's pitched roof. Through modelling and analysis, the amount of solar energy captured by the photovoltaic roof is quantitatively simulated and the dynamic energy-saving potential of the renovation project under changing actual meteorological conditions is pre-evaluated. The preliminary results indicate that such green renovations can contribute to about 164,066 kWh annual solar energy collection and the self-use electricity from the PV roof accounts for 42-76% of total energy consumption, leading to about 60% building energy consumption conservation. The payback period of such a renovation program is assessed to be about 1.9 years, which is quite economically feasible considering the local energy tariff policy. This paper explores the feasibility and design direction of green and low-carbon renovation and upgrading of old buildings, which can provide a reference for the application of green and low-carbon renovation of local old buildings.

ID PRE-CRASTINATION
AB Although procrastination has been extensively studied, precrastination remains an unsolved puzzle. Precrastination is the tendency to start tasks as soon as possible, even at the cost of extra effort. Using the near bucket paradigm with 81 undergraduate students, this study examined the relationship between precrastination and time perspective, proactive personality, and subjects' differential performance in intertemporal decision-making. The results confirmed the cognitive-load-reduction (CLEAR) hypothesis. Precrastination was found to be positively predicted by the future time dimension of time perspective and negatively predicted by proactive personality. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between precrastination and delay discounting of intertemporal decision-making, which exists only for the loss situation.

AB Genetic improvement of grain quality is more challenging in hybrid rice than in inbred rice due to additional nonadditive effects such as dominance. Here, we describe a pipeline developed for joint analysis of phenotypes, effects, and generations (JPEG). As a demonstration, we analyze 12 grain quality traits of 113 inbred lines (male parents), five tester lines (female parents), and 565 (113x5) of their hybrids. We sequence the parents for single nucleotide polymorphisms calling and infer the genotypes of the hybrids. Genome-wide association studies with JPEG identify 128 loci associated with at least one of the 12 traits, including 44, 97, and 13 loci with additive effects, dominant effects, and both additive and dominant effects, respectively. These loci together explain more than 30% of the genetic variation in hybrid performance for each of the traits. The JEPG statistical pipeline can help to identify superior crosses for breeding rice hybrids with improved grain quality.
   Genetic dissection of hybrids is more difficult than inbreds as nonadditive effects are involved. Here, the authors report a pipeline for joint analysis of phenotypes, effects, and generations and demonstrate its usefulness in identification of loci associated with quality traits and improving predict accuracy in genomic selection of hybrid rice.

AB Reducing the heat transfer temperature difference via reasonable indoor temperature determination and air conditioning system design is a confirmed building energy-saving approach for space cooling and heating. However, the energy-saving mechanism cannot be explained scientifically and comprehensively while maintaining the cognitive level of the heat transfer law. In this paper, based on the same climatic conditions and decreasing range of indoor and outdoor temperature difference, the yearly and monthly absolute energy-saving amount (ESA) and relative energy-saving ratio (ESR) are investigated and compared for cooling and heating, respectively, to reveal the energy-saving mechanism for cooling and heating from the microscopic perspective. Two new concepts, including ESA by temperature difference and behavioral ESA by measure itself, are defined. The yearly ESA for cooling or heating caused by the decreasing of temperature difference is composed of those two factors. For cooling, the contribution rate of the behavioral ESA at those moments within the decreasing range of the temperature difference can be up to 78%, while for heating is only 7%. This work can provide theoretical support for building energy system design optimization and method reference for energy-saving analysis of building air conditioning systems with temperature difference considerations for cooling and heating, respectively.

AB Salmonella spp. are pathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhea, abortion, and death in yak and severely harm livestock breeding. Therefore, it is vital to identify a probiotic that effectively antagonizes Salmonella. To the best of our knowledge, few prior studies have investigated the efficacy of Enterococcus faecium against Salmonella. Here, we evaluated the enteroprotective mechanism of E. faecium in a mouse Salmonella infection model using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) technology, microbial diversity sequencing, and metabonomics. Enterococcus faecium inhibited the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma and promoted the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidota (F/B) ratio and the abundances of Firmicutes and Akkermansia were significantly higher in the E. faecium than in the Salmonella group. Metabonomics and microbial diversity sequencing disclosed five different metabolites with variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 3 that were characteristic of both the Salmonella and E. faecium groups. Combined omics revealed that Lactobacillus and Bacteroides were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with cholic acid, while Desulfovibrio was positively correlated with lipids in both the control and Salmonella groups. Desulfovibrio was also positively correlated with lipids in both the Salmonella and E. faecium groups. Enterococcus faecium antagonizes Salmonella by normalizing the abundance of the intestinal microorganisms and modulating their metabolic pathways. Hence, it may efficaciously protect the host intestine against Salmonella infection.

AB BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 outbreak, most Chinese college students were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. COVID-19-associated impact has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of post-traumatic symptoms disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about the psychological processes that mediate this association. This study investigated the association between COVID-19-associated impact and PTSD and examined whether past stressful events, psychological resilience, and social support have mediating effects on this association.MethodsThe 12,397 valid responses from 31cities in China via an online survey assessed PTSD symptoms, past stressful events, psychological resilience, social support and social-demographic variables. AMOS was used to test the hypotheses of mediating effects.ResultsOn the 39th day of the declared COVID-19 epidemic in China, 6.75% of the surveyed sample showed PTSD symptoms. A positive mediating effect of past stressful events was found between COVID-19-associated impact and PTSD, whereas psychological resilience and social support had negative mediating effects. The fit indices for the path model were found to be significant (beta = 0.28, p < 0.001), COVID-19-associated impact indirectly affects the risk of PTSD through mediating pathways (past stressful events -> psychological resilience -> social support) on PTSD.ConclusionsAttention should be paid to the effects of past stressful events of Chinese college students who were home-quarantined during the COVID-19 epidemic, and strategies should also be implemented to improve social support and develop psychological resilience.

AB IntroductionThis study conducted an ethnobotanical survey of wild medicinal plants in the multi-ethnic areas of Gansu-Ningxia-Inner Mongolia intersection zone. Traditional knowledge of medicinal plant use in the region was compiled to identify important medicinal plants currently used for treating relevant diseases and to determine species with potential for development.MethodsKey informant interviews, semi-structured interviews, participatory rural appraisal methods, and ethnobotanical quantitative evaluation were used to investigate and study the traditional knowledge of local residents' use of wild medicinal plants in the region. The relative importance of the referenced plants was assessed, as well as the prominent species widely used in medicinal applications.ResultsThe study found that the region has a total of 204 wild medicinal plant resources, belonging to 149 genera of 51 families. Among these resources, a total of 50 commonly used plants were identified (44 of which were herbs, some of which were multi-origin), belonging to 27 families, with the most species found in the Asteraceae family, with 11 species. These herbs are mainly used for preventing and treating colds and nourishing health, followed by treatment of fever, stomach problems, and bleeding. The most frequently used medicinal plant in the region is "Ai", which includes Artemisia argyi Levl. et Van. and Artemisia kanashiroi Kitam. All respondents provided information about the use of this medicinal plant to varying degrees, followed by Artemisia annua Linn., Ephedra sinica Stapf, Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz., Sonchus arvensis Linn., Artemisia capillaris Thunb., among others.ConclusionOur investigation gained a wealth of traditional knowledge about the use of wild herbs, using wild herbs, which plays an important role in the lives of local residents. Especially, the herbs and application methods used for treating colds, bleeding, and stomach problems are worthy of further research and development.

AB Background: Zoomorphism, an obverse of conventional anthropomorphism, has been shown in many cases to be a powerful tool with respect to the metaphorical use of animals.Objectives: This study introduced zoomorphism into the instructional video design of pedagogical agents (PAs).Method: We first developed three image sets, each of which corresponded to a type of zoomorphic PA image construct (full panda, a human face with a panda body, and a human body with panda head imagery). Then, we conducted an image-screening experiment in which 177 second-grade students from a primary school were asked to select their favourite PA image for each image construct set. We used a realistic human PA as the baseline. Next, 114 second-grade students from another school were randomly assigned to learn instructional videos on the topic of pandas using a PA with one of four imageries.Results and Conclusions: ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that students presented with PAs with full-panda imagery achieved significantly higher learning performance, learning experience, social presence, and learning interest than those presented with other imageries of PAs. The regression results showed that the effect of zoomorphic PAs with full-panda imagery on learning performance was exerted in a direct way and that its effect on learning experience was mediated by social presence and learning interest.Implications: Our findings suggest that zoomorphic appearance is an essential quality for video learning that merits further investigation for the efficient imagery construction of PAs.

AB Consensus is an important issue in group decision making to make a reliable and scientific decision, and it has become a hot topic recently. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making problems, several aspects of alternatives should be considered in decision-making process. Also, the bounded rational characteristics of decision makers (DMs) may significantly affect the decision results. This paper proposes a multi-criteria consensus model based on prospect theory (PT) to consider the unsymmetrical risk attitudes of DM for gain or loss and on endo-confidence (confidence which is derived by DMs' evaluation information) levels of DMs to determine their weights. First, the reference point in PT is selected and how to measure the prospect consensus degree is presented. Then, the way to identify the expert who need to modify his/her evaluation is given and two programming models are proposed to obtain the updated evaluation. Subsequently, both the overall difference and the endo-confidence level of the DM are used to determine the weights of DMs. Finally, an illustrative example and the comparative analysis are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.

AB Simple Summary Conservation funds and resources have long been globally inadequate, and methods that could maximize conservation outcomes with limited investment, such as umbrella-species strategies, are thus needed to address the current biodiversity crisis. In this study, we summarized 242 published scientific articles and found 213 terrestrial vertebrates that were recommended as umbrella species. We summarized global trends in umbrella species selection and research during the past four decades, with North America, Europe, and Asia over-representing umbrella-related studies, and thus, more umbrella species recommendations have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere. Generally, there has been a bias toward recommending bird and mammal species, wide-ranging species, and non-threatened species, such as umbrellas, and grouses (order Galliformes) and large carnivores have often been recommended as umbrellas across different continents by multiple studies. Given observed biases and trends, we raise concerns about neglecting amphibians and reptiles, the over-preference for wide-ranging and non-threatened species, and recommend little-known species. We argue that conservation umbrella strategies can be cost-effective and successful given that appropriate species are chosen in the right location, and our findings could inform future conservation research and practices using conservation umbrella strategies. The umbrella-species strategy has been proposed as an attainable tool to achieve multi-species and community conservation with limited investment. There have been many umbrella-related studies since the concept's inception; thus, a summary of global study efforts and recommended umbrella species is important for understanding advances in the field and facilitating conservation applications. Here, we collated 213 recommended umbrella species of terrestrial vertebrates from 242 scientific articles published during 1984-2021 and analyzed their geographic patterns, biological features, and conservation statuses to identify global trends in the selection of umbrella species. We found a considerable geographic bias: most studies and, consequently, recommended umbrella species are from the Northern Hemisphere. There is also a strong taxonomic bias, with grouses (order Galliformes) and large carnivores being the most popular umbrella species and amphibians and reptiles being largely overlooked. In addition, wide-ranging and non-threatened species were frequently recommended as umbrella species. Given the observed biases and trends, we caution that appropriate species need to be chosen for each location, and it is important to confirm that popular, wide-ranging species are effective umbrella species. Moreover, amphibians and reptiles should be investigated for their potential as umbrella species. The umbrella-species strategy has many strengths and, if applied appropriately, may be one of the best options in today's conservation research and funding landscape.

AB Simple Summary BPIV3 is a common pathogen causing respiratory disease in cattle and a significant contributing factor to BRDC; however, data on the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 are still scarce in China. The current study sought to investigate the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 in BRDC-affected beef cattle and yaks in China, and the findings suggest that BPIV3 genotype C strains, the dominant strains in China, have a broad geographical distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of the HN and genomic sequences reveals Chinese strains with some unique genetic characteristics, which enhances our knowledge of the prevalence and genetic variation in BPIV3. Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is a common respiratory pathogen that causes respiratory illness in cattle and makes a major contribution to the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC); however, data on the prevalence and molecular features of BPIV3 are still scarce in China. To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of BPIV3 in China, between September 2020 and June 2022, 776 respiratory samples were received from 58 BRDC-affected farms located in 16 provinces and one municipality. Those were screened for BPIV3 using a reverse transcription insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay. Meanwhile, the HN gene and complete genome sequence of strains from different provinces were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The tests showed that 18.17% (141/776) of samples tested were positive for BPIV3, which originated from 21 farms in 6 provinces. Moreover, 22 complete HN gene sequences and 9 nearly complete genome sequences were obtained from the positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on the HN gene and complete genome sequences revealed that the sequences were clustered in one large clade for all Chinese BPIV3 genotype C strains, while overseas strain sequences of BPIV3 genotype C clustered into other clades. Moving beyond the known complete genome sequences of BPIV3 in GenBank, a total of five unique amino acid mutations were found in N protein, F protein, and HN protein in Chinese BPIV3 genotype C strains. Taken together, this study reveals that BPIV3 genotype C strains, the dominant strains in China, have a broad geographical distribution and some unique genetic characteristics. These findings contribute to our understanding of the epidemiological characteristics and genetic evolution of BPIV3 in China.

AB In the development of elastic materials, the non-synergy between stretchability and toughness is a challenge. Herein, we propose a rational design of a composite hydrogel by introducing strongly polarized hydrated Li-ion clusters, electron-withdrawing carboxyl groups, and Sn(II) complexation into hydrogen-bonded poly(acryl-amide) (PAM) network. Weak interaction between Li-ions and amide groups facilitates the rapid flipping and slipping of the PAM chains during stretching, optimizing the stretchability of the hydrogel. This composite also provides an energy-dispersing mechanism based on strong ionic complexation between Sn(II) and amide groups, which improves its toughness. As-prepared composite hydrogel simultaneously exhibits high stretchability (>7000% elongation), ultra toughness of 580 kPa, excellent fatigue resistance and extreme temperature resis-tance (elastic at -60 and 70 degrees C). Due to its excellent comprehensive performances, the present soft material has broad application prospects in agriculture, medicine, construction, and machinery.

AB Selectively targeting the cannabinoid receptor CB2 is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory pain without psychiatric side effects mediated by the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Herein, we report the discovery of 4-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)azepan-2-one derivatives as a new class of CB2 agonists. Systematic structure-activity relationship inves-tigations resulted in the identification of the most potent compound 25r. This compound displayed high selectivity for CB2 against CB1 (CB2 EC50 = 21.0 nM, Emax = 87%, CB1 EC50 > 30 mu M, ratio CB1/CB2 > 1428) with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Especially, 25r demonstrated significant efficacy in the analgesic model of rodent inflammatory pain. All the results suggest that compound 25r could serve as a lead compound for treating inflammatory pain and deserves further in-depth studies.

AB Sperm cryopreservation is one of the most effective methods for the conservation of germplasm re-sources and used of superior sires widely. However, the motility of yak (Bos grunniens) sperm was low after thawing and the proteomics changes in sperm cryopreservation remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the differences between fresh sperm and frozen sperm of yak through the proteomic analysis and thus improve the understanding of sperm cryodamage. The Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) technology was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) before and after freezing. Then, GO and KEGG analysis were conducted to analyze the DEPs enriched signaling pathways. Finally, the DEPs, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 (NDUFS8) were verified by the immunofluorescence technique. The results showed that there were 229 DEPs between fresh and frozen-thawed yak sperm. Compared with the fresh sperm, 120 proteins were up-regulated and 109 proteins were down-regulated in frozen-thawed sperm. The GO annotation showed that the up-regulated proteins enriched in metabolic and cytoskeleton-related processes, including lipoprotein metabolic process, lipid transport, extracellular region and intermedi-ate filament cytoskeleton organization. In contrast, the down-regulated proteins enriched in biological processes including single fertilization, sperm capacitation and response to unfolded protein. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that freezing and thawing affected the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway and the glycerolipid metabolic pathway of yak sperm. Immunofluorescence results showed that the protein expression level of SOD1 protein in the frozen group was significantly lower than that in the fresh group (P < 0.01), and the protein expression level of NDUFS8 protein was significantly higher in frozen group (P < 0.01). This study revealed the DEPs be-tween fresh and frozen-thawed sperm and provides a theoretical basis to further explore the exertion of normal biological functions of yak sperm after freezing and thawing.

AB In this study, we investigated the change in microbiome composition of wild Sichuan takin (Budorcas tibetanus) during winter and spring and analyzed the physiological implications for such changes. Diversity analyses of the microbiome (average 15,091 high-quality reads per sample) in 24 fecal samples (15 from winter, 9 from spring) revealed that spring samples had higher species diversity and were compositionally different from winter samples (P < 0.05). Taxonomic composition analysis showed that the relative abundance increased in spring for Patescibacteria (2.7% vs. 0.9% in winter, P < 0.001) and Tenericutes (1.9% vs. 1% in winter, P < 0.05). Substantial increases in relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Micrococcaceae were identified in spring and winter, respectively. Mann-Whitney U and ANCOM identified seven differentially abundant genera: Enterococcus, Acetitomaculum, Blautia, Coprococcus 1, Lachnospiraceae UCG 008, Ruminococcus 2 and Ralstonia. All seven genera were significantly more abundant in spring (average 0.016-1.2%) than winter (average 0-0.16%), with the largest difference found in Ruminococcus (1.21% in spring vs. 0.16% in winter). The other six genera were undetectable in winter. Functional prediction and pathway analysis revealed that biosynthesis of cofactors (ko01240) had the highest gene count ratios in the winter, followed by the two-component system (ko02020). Seasonal variation affects the gut microbiomes in wild Sichuan takins, with winter associated with lower species diversity and spring with enrichment of cellulose-degrading genera and phytopathogens. Such changes were crucial in their adaptation to the environment, particularly the difference in food abundance.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) is a major regulator of fatty acid oxidation catalyzing the decarboxylation of malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA). Although its involvement in human diseases has been well studied, its role in intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition remains unknown. In this present study, 1726 bp of MCD cDNA was cloned (OM937122) from goat liver, including 5 ' UTR of 27 bp, 3 ' UTR of 199 bp, and CDS of 1500 bp, encoding 499 amino acids. In this present study, although the overexpression of MCD increased the mRNA expression of FASN and DGAT2, the expression of ATGL and ACOX1 was also activated significantly and resulted in a decrease in cellular lipid deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. Meanwhile, the silencing of MCD increased the cellular lipid deposition and was accompanied by the expression activation of DGAT2 and the expression suppression of ATGL and HSL, despite the expression suppression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, including ACC and FASN. However, the expression of DGAT1 was not affected significantly (p > 0.05) by the expression alteration of MCD in this present study. Furthermore, 2025 bp of MCD promoter was obtained and predicted to be regulated by C/EBP alpha, SP1, SREBP1, and PPARG. In summary, although different pathways may respond to the expression alteration of MCD, the expression of MCD was negatively correlated with the cellular lipid deposition in goat intramuscular preadipocytes. These data may be beneficial for enhancing our understanding of the regulation of IMF deposition in goats.

AB Mixing grass with legumes before ensiling is beneficial for improving dry matter and crude protein yield, but additional information is needed to balance nutrient content and fermentation quality. In this study, the microbial community, fermentation characteristics, and nutrient content of Napier grass mixed with alfalfa at different proportions were assessed. Tested proportions included: 100:0 (M0), 70:30 (M3), 50:50 (M5), 30:70 (M7), and 0:100 (MF). Treatments included: (CK) sterilized deionized water; (IN) selected lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum CGMCC 23166 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CGMCC 18233 (1.5 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh weight for each inoculant); and (CO) commercial lactic acid bacteria: L. plantarum (1 x 10(5) cfu/g of fresh weight). All mixtures were ensiled for 60 days. Data analysis was used as a completely randomized design with a 5-by-3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The results showed that with increasing alfalfa mixing ratio, dry matter, and crude protein increased, while neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber decreased both before and after ensiling (p < 0.05), which was not influenced by fermentation. Inoculation with IN and CO decreased pH and increased the lactic acid content compared to CK (p < 0.05), especially in silages M7 and MF. The highest Shannon index (6.24) and Simpson index (0.93) were observed in the MF silage CK treatment (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Lactiplantibacillus decreased with increasing alfalfa mixing ratio, while the abundance of Lactiplantibacillus was significantly higher in the IN-treated group than in other treatment groups (p < 0.05). A higher alfalfa mixing ratio improved the nutrient value, but also made fermentation more difficult. Inoculants improved the fermentation quality by increasing the abundance of Lactiplantibacillus. In conclusion, the groups M3 and M5 achieved the optimal balance of nutrients and fermentation. If a higher proportion of alfalfa needs to be used, it is recommended to use inoculants to ensure sufficient fermentation.

Therefore, this study combines an objective microclimatic monitoring approach with a subjective questionnaire method, to quantify the thermal comfort, and in a further step to investigate its relationship with inhabitants' thermal adaptation and thermal environment, for the outdoor (including public spaces and courtyards), semi-outdoor (referring to the spaces under eaves) and indoor (referring to building interiors) spaces of Linpan. The results show that the neutral temperatures for outdoors and indoors are 26.64 degrees C and 26.84 degrees C, respectively. Air temperatures for all these four types of spaces exceed the inhabitants' thermal comfort. Microclimates are found to have strong influences on thermal comfort in Linpan: underlying surface temperature has the most influence on public spaces; air temperature is the important determinant for courtyards, the spaces under eaves and building interiors. Local residents have stronger preference for improving the air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed outdoors than indoors, because they can adapt better to the indoor environment. Our findings contribute to determining better ways of preserving the Linpan settlement by clearly understanding its thermal environment and thermal comfort requirements.

AB Rumen microorganisms play important roles in the healthy growth of yaks. This study investigated changes in yak rumen micro-biome during natural grazing at the warm seasons and supplementary feeding at cold seasons. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and metagenome analysis were conducted to investigate the structures and functions of yak rumen microbial com-munities. The results indicated that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla. In addition, Bacteroidetes might play a more important role than Firmicutes during the supplementary feeding stage (spring and winter), but less during natural grazing stage (summer and autumn). KEGG analysis showed that the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and fructose and mannose metabolism were the main pathways in the microbial community, which were significantly different between seasons. The carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme) annotation revealed that cellulose was an important carbon source for microorganisms in yak rumen. Glycoside hydro-lases (GHs) were the most abundant class of CAZymes, followed by glycosyl transferases (GTs), which were important to diges-tion of oil, cellulose, and hemicellulose in food. These results contribute to the understanding of microbial components and functions in yak rumen.

AB The fatty acid (FA) composition in the milk of lactating Tibetan women and the consequences of dietary patterns were evaluated. Our results suggested that the milk contained high total saturated fatty acid (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels compared to milk from other regions in China. However, the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are slightly lower. The docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentration was significantly lower (p < 0.05). Linoleic acid (LA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and DHA intakes were below the recommended levels. No significant correlation appeared between the main n-3 FAs in human milk and intake frequency. Collectively, the main n-3 FAs in human milk, including DHA and EPA, may be influenced by carbohydrate intake. Additionally, the Tibetan maternal diet was primarily sufficient with Zanba and buttered tea, but insufficient for fatty fish, vegetables, and fruits, leading to high carbohydrate intake.

AB BackgroundNardostachys jatamansi, an extremely endangered valuable plant of the alpine Himalayas, can synthesize specific sesquiterpenoids with multiple effective therapies and is widely exploited for the preparation of drugs, cosmetics and even religious functions (e.g., well-known spikenard). However, how accumulation trend of the sesquiterpenoids in tissues and the molecular mechanisms underlying the production of the active ingredients are not well understood. MethodsThe single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing were combined to analyse the roots, rhizomes, leaves, flowers and anthocaulus of N. jatamansi. The phytochemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). ResultsA high-quality full-length reference transcriptome with 26,503 unigenes was generated for the first time. For volatile components, a total of sixty-five compounds were successfully identified, including fifty sesquiterpenoids. Their accumulation levels in five tissues were significantly varied, and most of the sesquiterpenoids were mainly enriched in roots and rhizomes. In addition, five aromatic compounds were only detected in flowers, which may help the plant attract insects for pollination. For nonvolatile ingredients, nardosinone-type sesquiterpenoids (nardosinone, kanshone C, and isonardosinone) were detected almost exclusively in roots and rhizomes. The candidate genes associated with sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis were identified by transcriptome analysis. Consistently, it was found that most biosynthesis genes were abundantly expressed in the roots and rhizomes according to the functional enrichment and expression patterns results. There was a positive correlation between the expression profile of genes related to the biosynthesis and the accumulation level of sesquiterpenoids in tissues. Gene family function analysis identified 28 NjTPSs and 43 NjCYPs that may be involved in the biosynthesis of the corresponding sesquiterpenoids. Furthermore, gene family functional analysis and gene coexpression network analysis revealed 28 NjTPSs and 43 NjCYPs associated with nardosinone-type sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. ConclusionOur research results reveal the framework of sesquiterpenoids accumulation and biosynthesis in plant tissues and provide valuable support for further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of sesquiterpenoid regulation and accumulation in N. jatamansi and will also contribute to the comprehensive utilization of this alpine plant.

AB Contradiction between growing plantation economic demand and agro-ecological degradation has always restricted sustainable development of agricultural countries. This study applied the unit inventory analysis to evaluate the productions and discharges of farmland non-point source (FNPS) nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) among China's nine national-level agricultural districts over 1999-2019. On this basis, we quantified the evolutionary relationship between plantation economic output and FNPS pollution based on optimal regression fitting. The results showed that over 1999-2019, farmland cumulative TN and TP discharges for the whole China were approximately 15807 x 104 t and 1312 x 104 t, with prominent district heterogeneity. According to FNPS discharge magnitudes, China's agricultural districts can be classified into three categories: high, moderate and slight discharge zones. Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and Middle-lower Yangtze Plain were identified as the main severely-polluted districts. Mineral fertilizer is the primary contributor to FNPS pollution. Annual FNPS load showed a trend of increasing followed by decreasing, and the peak interval was recorded in 2014-2016. Spatiotemporal dynamics in FNPS discharge intensities were disparate from that in discharge magnitudes. SC has the highest TN discharge intensity, with an annual average intensity of 0.068 t/ha, followed by MLYP (0.044 t/ ha) and HHHP (0.041 t/ha). HHHP has the highest TP discharge intensity, with an annual average intensity of 0.0051 t/ha, followed by SC (0.0038 t/ha) and MLYP (0.0031 t/ha). District-based agro-ecological restoration strategies were accordingly proposed considering FNPS discharge magnitude and intensity concurrently. In most agricultural districts, with the growing economic output in plantation, the FNPS load showed an increase fol-lowed by a decrease or to leveling off. Furthermore, with the increasing TN/TP economic partial productivity, the FNPS TN/TP discharge intensities reached the climax, then declined or tended to be flattening out.

AB The Zn-Ag and Zn-Ag/air hybrid batteries are challenged by the low conductivity and capacity of Ag electrode materials. How to further optimize and tune the surface electronic structure of Ag nanomaterials has become an important topic in the improvement of Ag electrode materials. Herein, the silver nanobelts (Ag NBs) materials were prepared by a fast and simple redox replacement reaction. The special nanobelts structure, with the key surface features of the gully-like morphology, raised Ag mounds and superlattice fringes, are beneficial to tune the surface electron structure and thereby increase the conductivity and electrochemical performance of Ag NBs. As a consequence, the assembled Zn-Ag battery exhibits favorable electrochemical performance in view of the specific capacity of 380.9 mAh gAg- 1. In addition, the hybrid Zn-Ag/air battery shows two-step voltage plateaus of 1.83 and 1.55 V in the Zn-Ag reaction, as well as a voltage plateau of 1.23 V corresponding to the Zn-air reaction. The hybrid battery maintains a high energy efficiency of 76.9% and high rate capabilities, demonstrating an excellent energy-saving feature of this battery. The insights gained from this work may be beneficial for designing the highly-efficient Ag catalysts for electrochemical energy storage.

AB Goats are an important livestock and goat meat is essential to local people. The intramuscular fat (IMF) content has a great influence on the quality of goat meat. The intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation is closely related to the IMF deposition; however, its potential regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. CircRNAs were revealed to be involved in multiple biological progressions. In this study, we took primary goat intramuscular preadipocyte (GIMPA) as the study model to verify the function and mechanism of chi-circ_0006511, which was abundant and up-regulated in mature adipocytes (GIMA). The results showed that the expression level of chi-circ_0006511 gradually increased in the early stage of GIMPA differentiation, and chi-circ_0006511 was confirmed to promote GIMPA lipid droplets aggregation and up-regulate the adipogenic differentiation determinants, further promoting GIMPA differentiation. Mechanistically, chi-circ_0006511 exerts its function by sponging novel-miR-87, thereby regulating the expression of CD36. The results from this study provided novel significant information to better understand the molecular regulatory mechanism of intramuscular preadipocytes differentiation, thereby providing a new reference for the intramuscular fat adipogenesis in goats.

AB Simple Summary The broad adoption of camera traps in wildlife monitoring leads to a better understanding of the distribution and activity patterns of wild animals. In this study, two endangered wild animals distributed in the Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, the tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor), were investigated for habitat suitability and rhythm activity patterns based on 9-year (2012-2021) camera-trap data. The results revealed that the suitable range of the major environmental factors and the distribution range of tufted deer in the reserve were greater than those of sambar. The daily activity peaks in tufted deer and sambar were both at dusk and dawn, but sambar stayed active during the evening. Clarifying the distribution pattern and overlapping relationship of sympatric relative species in the spatio-temporal niche is of great significance to the basic theory of community ecology and integrated management of multi-species habitats in the same landscape. In this study, based on a 9-year dataset (2012-2021) from 493 camera-trap sites in the Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, we analyzed the habitat distributions and activity patterns of tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor). (1) Combined with 235 and 153 valid presence sites of tufted deer and sambar, the MaxEnt model was used to analyze the distribution of the two species based on 11 ecological factors. The distribution areas of the two species were 1038.40 km(2) and 692.67 km(2), respectively, with an overlapping area of 656.67 km(2). Additionally, the overlap indexes Schoener's D (D) and Hellinger's-based I (I) were 0.703 and 0.930, respectively. (2) Based on 10,437 and 5203 independent captures of tufted deer and sambar, their daily activity rhythms were calculated by using the kernel density estimation. The results showed that the daily activity peak in the two species appeared at dawn and dusk; however, the activity peak in tufted deer at dawn and dusk was later and earlier than sambar, respectively. Our findings revealed the spatio-temporal niche relationship between tufted deer and sambar, contributing to a further understanding of the coexistence mechanism and providing scientific information for effective wild animal conservation in the reserve and other areas in the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB The essential of the human cooperative behavior is to find an effective mechanism to promote cooperation. In reality, there is a class of professionals who punish evil and promote good, such as police officers, judges, and volunteers. Their actions and respon-sibilities can profoundly affect the actions of other individuals by fines and bonuses. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a Reward and Punishment Mechanism with weighting (RPMW) for promoting cooperation. The core of RPMW lies in three aspects: (i) A subset of players are tagged as supervisors, who are generated by a random algorithm. If the supervisor chooses to cooperate, she/he acts as the doer of rewards and punishments, otherwise she/he is a general player. (ii) Each supervisor asks their neighbors in turn as well as rewards cooperators and punishes defectors. Bonuses (penalties) are calculated according to a weighting which is the ratio of the number of current evolutionary round cooperators (defectors) to the total of players. (iii) A factor alpha is added to control the intensity of rewards and punishments, and the /3 is denoted as the percentage of supervisors in the group. Furthermore, we do a detailed ablation study on the Reward Mechanism with Weighting (RMW) and Punishment Mechanism with Weighting (PMW) in three social dilemmas. The simulation results show that RPMW can effectively promote cooperation in prisoner's dilemma (PDG), snowdrift game (SDG) and stag-hunt game (SHG). We find that the frequency of cooperation reaches highest when the alpha is at its maximum and the /3 is in a positive impact on evolutionary cooperation. The results prove that RPMW is more effective than RMW and PMW on enhancing cooperation in PDG, SDG.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Simple Summary Herbs, as supplementary feed, have shown positive effects on livestock. The yak is a unique animal on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, and plays important roles in local livelihoods and ecology. Because of the harsh climate conditions, early weaned yak calves often face environmental and nutritional stress. The herbal active ingredients of some herbs improve the antioxidant capacity and immunity of animals. In the current study, early-weaned yak calves were supplemented with three widely used Chinese traditional herbal root extracts to examine whether they can improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrated that the supplementary herbs increased the serum antioxidant capacity, and improved the energy and nitrogen metabolism of the yak calves. Chinese traditional herbs are used widely as feed supplements to improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity of livestock. Twenty early-weaned 4-month-old yak calves (72.3 +/- 3.65 kg) were divided randomly into four groups (n = 5 per group); three groups were provided with supplementary 80 mL/kg DMI of the root water extracts of either Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and one group (control) was not provided with a supplement. Compared to control calves, calves consuming the three herbal extracts increased serum concentrations of albumin (ALB) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but decreased serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05). Calves consuming A. sinensis decreased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC), and increased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total proteins (TP). Serum FFA concentrations increased (p = 0.004) linearly with time in the control group, but not in the groups consuming herbs. Serum metabolomic data demonstrated that A. sinensis and C. pilosula regulate mainly amino acid metabolism, while G. uralensis regulates mainly carbon and amino acid metabolism. It was concluded that the three herbal root extracts, as dietary supplements, improved energy and nitrogen metabolism, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of yak calves.

AB The yaks belong to the genus Bos within the family Bovidae that live in the Tibet Plateau and is an indispensable economic resource for the local herders. Respiratory tract infections are common diseases in yaks caused by various pathogens; however, there have been no reports of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) infection. This study was conducted to investigate the pathogens and analyze their characteristics from the four yak lung samples with severe respiratory tract infection symptoms in the yak farm. Results showed that out of four lung samples, three were identified as BPIV3-positive by RT-PCR. A BPIV3 strain (10(6.5) TCID50/mL) was successfully isolated from the BPIV3-positive lung samples using Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. The isolate caused systemic infection in the BALB/c mice and induced pathological changes in the lungs. Moreover, three complete BPIV3 genomes were amplified from the clinical samples. Phylogenetic trees based on the complete genomes, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), phosphoprotein (P), and large polymerase subunit protein (L) amino acid sequences showed that the complete BPIV3 genomes belonged to BPIV3 genotype C, and clustered into a large branch with the Chinese strains, although the three yak BPIV3 strains were clustered into a small branch. Compared to known BPIV3 genotype C strains in GenBank, the three genomes of yak BPIV3 showed four identical amino acid mutations in the HN, P and L proteins, suggesting a unique genetic evolution of BPIV3 in yaks. This study first isolated and characterized the BPIV3 from yaks, which contributed to the understanding of the infection and evolution of BPIV3 in yaks in the Tibet Plateau.

AB This paper studies the H-infinity control problem of discrete-time delayed switched systems with average dwell time switching signals using event-triggered-mechanism. The event-triggeredmechanism can reduce redundant information transmission. First, employing state-feedback controller, two sufficient conditions are proposed to guaranteeing (i) exponential stability of the disturbance-free closed-loop system and (ii) H-infinity performance of the closed-loop system with disturbance. Moreover, the controller gain is explicitly computed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Second, results obtained for state-feedback controller are extended to those for observer-based state-feedback controller, and both the controller and observer gains are explicitly computed. All conditions are derived by utilizing a properly constructed decay-rate-dependent Lyapunov functional. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the validity of the obtained theoretical results.

AB Slowly time-varying delays are seldom, but do need to be, considered in the context of discrete-time systems. This paper addresses the exponential stability issue of discretetime systems with slowly time-varying delays. The basic idea is to transform, by utilizing the switching transformation approach, the original system with slowly time-varying delays into an equivalent switched system with special switching signal. Different types of delays correspond to different types of switching signals, and the stability issue of the original system is converted into that of a switched system. It is the first time that the method of switched homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function is applied to general delayed systems. Some sufficient exponential stability conditions for the original system are proposed in several situations. It is numerically shown that the conservativeness of the proposed conditions reduces as the degree of the switched homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function increases.

AB The genetic adaptations to harsh climatic conditions in high altitudes and genetic basis of important agronomic traits are poorly understood in Elymus sibiricus L. In this study, an association population of 210 genotypes was used for population structure, selective sweep analysis, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on 88,506 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found 965 alleles under the natural selection of high altitude, which included 7 hub genes involved in the response to UV, and flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic process based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Using a mixed linear model (MLM), the GWAS test identified a total of 1,825 significant loci associated with 12 agronomic traits. Based on the gene expression data of two wheat cultivars and the PPI analysis, we finally identified 12 hub genes. Especially, in plant height traits, the top hub gene (TOPLESS protein) encoding auxins and jasmonic acid signaling pathway, shoot apical meristem specification, and xylem and phloem pattern formation was highly overexpressed. These genes might play essential roles in controlling the growth and development of E. sibiricus. Therefore, this study provides fundamental insights relevant to hub genes and will benefit molecular breeding and improvement in E. sibiricus and other Elymus species.

AB As a new form of online reviews, Q&A reviews have been recently used by many e-commerce platforms to compensate for the weaknesses and problems related to trust and helpfulness found in traditional online reviews. This research documents what motivates people to share products or purchasing knowledge with others through Q&A reviews and why e-commerce platforms should place an emphasis on Q&A reviews. Importantly, our results provide evidence that, when receiving feedback (i.e., comments and likes), people are more likely willing to share knowledge with others and will have a higher level of loyalty. We believe that this study contributes to knowledge sharing and the e-commerce literature, and also has practical implications.

AB In this study, 192 diarrheal fecal samples were collected from 2019 to 2021 for monitoring the molecular prevalence of canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) among dogs in Southwest China, and 113 samples were detected as Carnivore protoparvovirus 1-positive. Surprisingly, 28/113 (24.8%) strains were identified as feline parvovirus (FPV)-like viruses based on the key amino acid (aa) residues in VP2. Further, 6 FPV-like strains were successfully isolated and genome sequenced, and phylogenetic trees based on the genome, VP2 and NS1 sequences showed that the 6 FPV-like strains were most genetically related with FPV instead of CPV-2. Interestingly, the VP2 proteins of the FPV-like virus contained all key aa residues typical for FPV and can be 100% identical to that of FPV, but the VP1 intron and NS1 aa sequences exhibited some unique molecular characteristics. The FPV-like isolate could hemagglutinate swine erythrocyte at pH values between 6 and 8, and replicated efficiently in MDCK cell line; moreover, the virus could cause canine systemic infection via oral administration. Further analysis based on VP2 sequences of FPV and CPV-2 in GenBank revealed that the FPV-like virus had already existed among dogs in 4 Asian countries, and have circulated widely in China. This study first confirmed that the FPV-like isolates could efficiently infect dogs, and has been prevalent among dogs in China. Moreover, this study first reported the genome characteristics of the FPV-like virus in dogs, which may represent a novel evolution pattern involving in the cross-species transmission of the virus from cats to dogs.

AB Most alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau are at different stages of community succession induced by grazing practices. Quantifying the succession sequence and assessing the dynamics of plant composition, ecosystem coupling, and multifunctionality across successional stages are essential for reasonable restoration of degraded alpine meadow. Here, we selected areas with different grazing disturbance histories and used them as a space series (i.e., space-for-time substitution) to study the community succession. Our work quantified the plant succession sequence of alpine meadow induced by grazing with plant functional group approach. The plant succession sequence is from the tall sedge community with erect growth to the short undesirable toxic forbs community with prostrate growth. Ecosystem coupling, ecosystem multifunctionality and their relationships were all the lowest in Stage 4. Compared to Stage 4, the ecosystem multifunctionality index increased in Stages 1, 2, and 3 by 102.6, 89.8, and 207.6%, respectively; the extent of ecosystem coupling increased by 20.0, 16.8, and 21.2%, respectively. Our results indicated that the driving factors of ecosystem coupling and ecosystem multifunctionality were soil factor individual in early successional stage to plant-soil simultaneously in late successional stage. Our results also highlighted the importance of toxic weeds during the late stage of degraded succession and suggest that the expansion of toxic plants is a consequence of their greater suitability from a successional perspective. The findings of this study would provide valuable guidance for optimizing the management and restoration practice of alpine meadow.

AB Spleen plays an indispensable role in the immune system as the largest lymphatic organ in the body. The spleens of yaks at three developmental stages (1 day fetal yak, 15 months juvenile yak and 5 years old adult yak) were sampled and the Tandem mass tag (TMT) quantification method was employed in spleen proteomic analysis. The results showed that 6576 proteins and 529 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the yak spleens at three growth stages. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of DEPs indicated that DEPs were enriched in Oxygen transport, Actin filament movement, DNA replication, Cell cycle process, and Cell macromolecule biosynthesis process, which was conducive to high altitude breathing, protein synthesis and organ growth in yaks. These were indispensable for yak spleen growth and cell metabolism, high altitude adaptation. Those DEPs were further analyzed based on Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways, which principally participated in Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Phagosome, and Glutathione metabolism. Those pathways were associated with some animal life activities in defense against microbial antigens, indicating that with age, the immune function of the yak's spleen continued to increase. Hemoglobin, Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 1 (TRAF1), T cell receptor (TCR), Macrophage receptor, Fc receptors (FcR), and Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of DEPs played roles in immune function in yak spleen directly or indirectly. The dynamic changes of Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2), TRAF1 and Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27 or HSPB1) detected by Immunohistochemistry were consistent with those obtained from TMT proteomic. In conclusion, this study provides extensive and functional analyses of the spleen proteome at three developmental stages and will offer a new insight into key proteins involved in the immune function of yak spleen.

AB Peach gummosis is one of the most widespread and destructive diseases. It causes growth stunting, yield loss, branch, trunk, and tree death, and is becoming a restrictive factor in healthy and sustainable development of peach production. Although a locus has been identified based on bi-parental quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, selection of gummosis-resistant cultivars remains challenging due to the lack of resistant parents and of the complexity of an inducing factor. In this study, an integrated approach of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and comparative transcriptome was used to elucidate the genetic architecture associated with the disease using 195 accessions and 145,456 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated using 2-year phenotypic data and genotypic data, which gave high values of 70 and 73%, respectively. Evaluation of population structure by neighbor-joining and principal components analysis (PCA) clustered all accessions into three major groups and six subgroups, mainly according to fruit shape, hairy vs. glabrous fruit skin, pedigree, geographic origin, and domestication history. Five SNPs were found to be significantly associated with gummosis disease resistance, of which SNPrs285957, located on chromosome6 across 28 Mb, was detected by both the BLINK and the FarmCPU model. Six candidate genes flanked by or harboring the significant SNPs, previously implicated in biotic stress tolerance, were significantly associated with this resistance. Two highly resistant accessions were identified with low disease severity, which could be potential sources of resistance genes for breeding. Our results provide a fresh insight into the genetic control of peach gummosis disease.

AB The Guangyuan Thousand-Buddha grotto is of great value in researching the spread of Buddhism in China. To explore a scientific deterioration degree evaluation method, the authors selected 11 grottos from the middle Tang Dynasty in the Guangyuan Thousand-Buddha grotto as survey objects; a traditional deterioration investigation was undertaken, and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP method) was applied to build a system to calculate the weight of 15 deterioration criteria and evaluate the deterioration degree of the grotto. The results showed that 15 deteriorations can be classified into two categories: stability deterioration and weathering deterioration. Each deterioration has its own weight on affecting the preservation condition of the grotto. In contrast to realistic conditions, the calculation results can quantitatively reflect the preservation condition of the grotto. The results offer a quantitative basis for determining the priority of grotto conservation and verifying the feasibility of the AHP method in helping conservators identify major deteriorations or judge conservation orders. This research proposes a quantitative evaluation method for the deterioration degree of the grotto, which can lay the foundation for further conservation of the grotto.

AB Cellulose derivatives are widely applied in the field of oil and gas exploration. However, this kind of natural polymers always shows poor temperature resistance due to their organic nature. To improve the temperature resistance of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), inorganic nano-SiO2 was introduced onto HEC polymer chains through the silylation coupling technique. And Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), and thermogravimetic analysis (TGA) were used to analyze the nanocomposite. As a result, nano-SiO2 particle is chemically coupled onto hydroxyethyl cellulose molecule, and nano-SiO2/hydroxyethyl cellulose nanocomposite (RJ-HEC) shows excellent thermal stability comparing with HEC polymer. In experiment, thermal aging tests were utilized, and test results suggest that nano-SiO2/hydroxyethyl cellulose (RJ-HEC) nanocomposite can be utilized as thickening agent of water-based drilling fluid, which shows improved rheology stability at 210 degrees C and excellent salt (NaCl) tolerance.

AB Simple Summary Increasing milk fat rate has a good effect on the milk quality of cattleyak. SNPs can help us find potential molecular markers for the milk fat traits of cattleyak, and they can be screened according to molecular markers when they are young. It provides a reference for cultivating high milk fat cattle population in the future. The results of this study suggest that the SORBS1 gene polymorphism is closely related to the milk fat traits of cattleyak, which could be used as a candidate genetic marker for milk fat trait selection in cattleyak. This study provides a new molecular marker and theoretical basis for screening the milk fat traits of cattleyak. It has a certain reference value for the research and improvement of milk quality. This study aimed to find the SNPs in the SORBS1 gene of cattleyak, analyze the relationship between its polymorphisms and the milk fat traits, and find potential molecular markers for the milk fat traits of cattleyak. The polymorphism of the SORBS1 gene in 350 cattleyak from Hongyuan County (Sichuan, China) were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing, and the correlation between these SNPs and the milk production traits of cattleyak was analyzed. The results showed that there were nine SNPs in the CDS and their adjacent non-coding regions of the SORBS1 gene, and all SNPs have three genotypes. The correlation analysis found that the genotypes with superior milk fat traits in the other eight alleles were homozygous genotypes with a high genotype frequency except the g.96284 G > A (c.3090 G > A) (p < 0.05). However, at locus g.96284 G > A, the milk fat percentage, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) of the GA genotype were significantly higher than that of GG and AA genotypes (p < 0.05). Among these SNPs, three SNPs (g.6256 C > T (c.298 C > T), g.24791 A > G (c.706 A > G) and g.29121 A > G (c.979 A > G)) caused the amino acids change. The genotypes of the three SNPs consist of three haplotypes and four diplotypes. The amino acid mutation degree of diplotype H1-H1 (CCAAAA) was the highest, and its milk fat percentage, MUFAs, PUFAs and SFAs were also the highest (p < 0.05). Taken together, we found nine SNPs in the SORBS1 gene that are closely related to the milk fat traits of cattleyak. Moreover, the mutation of amino acids caused by SNPs had positive effects on the milk fat traits of cattleyak. H1-H1 is the dominant diplotype which significantly related to the milk fat traits of cattleyak. This study provides a new molecular marker and theoretical basis for screening the milk fat traits of cattleyak.

AB Polygonum multiflorum (PM), a popular functional food, and a herbal and dietary supplement, is widely used as a tonic in China and East Asia. In recent years, it has attracted great concern for its ability to cause idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (IDILI). However, identifying individuals susceptible to IDILI remains challenging. This is a prospective study. For 6 patients whose serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels after consuming PM were abnormally elevated (susceptible group), 15 patients with normal levels of liver injury markers were matched (tolerant group) based on similar baseline characteristics. ProcartaPlex immunoassays were adopted to quantitatively detect 33 serum cytokines in the two groups of patients before consuming PM, to characterize the cytokine profile and screen differential cytokines. Subsequently, the susceptibility of a potential biomarker to regulate PM-induced liver injury was validated in animal models. There were significant differences in the cytokine profiles between the susceptible and tolerant groups, wherein the susceptible patients showed immune perturbation characterized by high expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines, especially the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (P = 0.006). Among them, the cytokine TNF-alpha had the strongest correlation with ALT, where the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.6, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was more than 0.8. Animal experiments revealed that both PM water extract and its susceptibility component of liver injury, cis-stilbene glucoside, could cause liver injury in the mice pre-stimulated using TNF-alpha. Conversely, administration of the same dose of drugs on control mice did not show any hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, immune perturbation mainly mediated by TNF-alpha may regulate the susceptibility to PM-induced liver injury. This provides a new perspective for the study of susceptibility to IDILI.

AB Litter has been shown to alter the structure and functions of grassland ecosystems, and a knowledge of the effects of litter is essential for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem multifunctionality. However, relatively little is known about the effects of plant litter on ecosystem multifunctionality in alpine meadows. A three-year field experiment was conducted to explore how litter manipulation affects ecosystem multifunctionality. The plant litter treatments that were applied consisted of a range of litter mass levels and three dominant plant species, in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that litter mass manipulation had a negative effect on ecosystem multifunctionality and most individual ecosystem functions (species richness, plant cover, and above-ground biomass) but had a positive effect on plant functional group evenness. In particular, the study found that low or medium amounts of litter (<= 200gm(-2)) were beneficial in maintaining a high level of ecosystem multifunctionality. Furthermore, a structural equation model revealed that ecosystem multifunctionality was driven by indirect effects of litter mass manipulation on plant functional group evenness, plant cover, and species richness. These results suggest that litter-induced effects may be a major factor in determining grassland ecosystem multifunctionality, and they indicate the potential importance of grassland management strategies that regulate the dynamics of litter accumulation.

AB Obesity is a risk factor of many diseases, but could be beneficial to the individuals with bacterial infection. The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between obesity and heart during nonfatal bacterial infection. Male normal (lean) and diet-induced obesity mice (DIO, fed with high-fat diet) were chosen to perform nasal instillation with E. coli to establish a nonfatal acute mouse model. The cardiac histopathology, inflammation and oxidative damage, as well as apoptosis were detected post-infection. The results revealed that the Escherichia coli (E.coli)-infected mice exhibited increased cardiac index, contents of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, leptin and resistin, levels of apoptotic proteins (caspase-3 and caspase-9, and bax/bcl-2 ratio), cardiac pathological changes and oxidative stress. Furthermore, these parameters were more serious in the lean mice than those in the DIO mice. In summary, our findings gave a new sight that E.coli infection impaired heart via histopathological lesions, inflammation and oxidative stress and excessive apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, obesity exerted attenuated effects on the heart of mice with non-fatal infection of E.coli through decreased inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiac tissue.

AB Background During maturation, spermatozoa acquire motility and fertilizing capacity as they transit through the epididymis. In recent years, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been employed in proteomics studies conducted in rat, boar and human. However, there has not been a complete information regarding the proteins associated with sperm maturation in the epididymis. In this study, we employed iTRAQ proteomics to investigate proteins associated with sperm maturation between yak and cattleyak epididymis. Results After a successful sampling and protein extraction, the iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis were performed. We identified 288 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between yak and cattleyak epididymis; 151 were up-regulated while 137 were down-regulated in cattleyak relative to yak. Gene Ontology analysis identified that down-regulated DAPs in cattleyak were mostly enriched in the acetylation of protein component, along with negative and positive regulatory activities. iTRAQ proteomics data showed that the top up-regulated DAPs were mainly enriched in cell communication, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, stress response, post-translational modifications and metabolic functions while the down-regulated DAPs were predominantly associated with sperm maturation, long-term sperm storage, sperm forward motility, sperm-oocyte fusion and regulatory functions. Conclusion These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying male cattleyak sterility.

ID EVOLUTION
AB The multiscale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA) is a competitive heuristic optimization algorithm that has been successfully implemented in many applications. This paper proposes a novel way to optimize MQHOA to further improve its performance. The idea is to use the historical information in the evolutionary iterative process of the algorithm to derive a direction in the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) process and as a multi scale in the M process, then take the guidance information as the parameter to generate a new solution. The combination of these processes, i.e., MQHOA combined with the guidance information, is called GI-MQHOA. The experimental results show that the guidance information is of great significance for the exploration and exploitation of MQHOA. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on the CEC2014 test suite, and shown to be comparable to other state-of-the-art swarm intelligence and heuristic algorithms. The principle of using guiding information is simple and effective and can be easily transplanted to other heuristic algorithms.

AB A series of novel Fe/Co layered double hydroxides modified with glycine (named as FeCo-LDH@G) were prepared and served as high-performance adsorbents for As (V). With a Fe/Co mole ratio of 1:1, the Fe0.02Co0.02-LDH@G adsorbents achieved significant improvements on the adsorption selectivity and capacity for As (V). The As (V) adsorption by Fe0.02Co0.02-LDH@G follows Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The maximum adsorption capacity is 820 mg g(-1) and the equilibrium reaches in 120 min. Under the assistance of electrochemical devices, the Fe0.02Co0.02-LDH@G adsorbent was regenerated and the adsorption capacity for As (V) was dropped only about 13.41% in 5 cycles. These excellent performances make Fe0.02Co0.02-LDH@G as promising As (V) adsorbents for commercial wastewater treatments.

AB A kinetic exchange model is used to investigate the evolution of wealth distribution in a financial market. Assume that the market is characterized by a risky asset (a stock) and a risk-less asset (a bond). The model captures wealth exchanges and speculative trading to affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. We embed a suitable value function into the interactions of wealth to describe that agents allocate their wealth between the risky and risk-less assets. The value function contains the predicted price and present price of the stock to depict reactions of agents toward potential risks. The price prediction and risk estimation affect investment strategies of agents through the value function. After constructing the interactions of wealth, we apply quasi-invariant wealth limits and Boltzmann-type equations to derive a Fokker-Planck equation with underlying equilibrium. When the wealth invested in the risky asset satisfies certain conditions, an explicit stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained to show that the wealth distribution converges exponentially to a close lognormal distribution in the long run. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate our results. ? 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on these phases, the structural evolution, lattice dynamics, electronic and thermal properties are discussed. Results show these phases are stable in energy, mechanics and thermodynamics. Study of the electronic density of states show they are all conductors with metallic property and are mainly made up from ionic bonds. Thermal properties show several atmospheric and high pressure VH2 phases have high Debye temperature, which indicates that they may have an important potential application in high temperature fields.

AB The epididymis is the site of post-testicular sperm maturation, which constitutes the acquisition of sperm motility and the ability to recognize and fertilize oocytes. The role of miRNA in male reproductive system, including the control of different steps leading to proper fertilization such as gametogenesis, sperm maturation and maintenance of male fertility where the deletion of Dicer in mouse germ cells led to infertility, has been demonstrated. The identification of miRNA expression in a region-specific manner will therefore provide valuable insight into the functional differences between the regions of the epididymis. In this study, we employed RNA-seq technology to explore the expression pattern of miRNAs and establish some miRNAs of significant interest with regard to epididymal sperm maturation in the CY epididymis. We identified a total of 431 DE known miRNAs; 119, 185 and 127 DE miRNAs were detected for caput versus corpus, corpus versus cauda and caput versus cauda region pairs, respectively. Our results demonstrate region-specific miRNA expression in the CY epididymis. The GO and KEGG enrichment for the predicted target genes indicated the functional values of miRNAs. Furthermore, we observed that the expression of miR-200a was downregulated in the caput, compared with cauda. Since the family of miR-200 has previously been suggested to contribute to the distinct physiological function of sperm maturation in epididymis of adult rat, we speculate that the downregulation of miR-200a in CY caput epididymis may play an important role of sperm maturation in the epididymis of CY. Therefore, our findings may not only increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulated by the miRNA functions in region-specific miRNA expression in the CY epididymis, it could provide a valuable information to understand the mechanism of male infertility of CY.

AB Previous research reported that KLF3 plays different roles in the regulation of adipose deposition across species. However, the exact function of KLF3 in goat subcutaneous adipocyte remains unknown. Here, the goat KLF3 gene was firstly cloned and showed that the mRNA sequence of the goat KLF3 gene was 1,264 bp (GenBank accession number: KU041753.1) and its coding sequence was 1,037 bp, encoding 345 amino acids with three classic zinc finger domains of KLFs family at its C-terminus. The alignment of the amino acid sequence of KLF3 among various species demonstrated that goat had the highest homology to that of sheep, presenting 99.4% similarity, while the homology similarity to that of mice presented only 93.62% in contrast. Furthermore, KLF3 had highest mRNA level in fat tissue and lowest level in the heart in comparison. Additionally, the mRNA level of KLF3 gradually tended to increase during adipogenesis. Interestingly, overexpression of KLF3 increased lipid accumulation. In line with this, the gain-of-function of KLF3 dramatically elevated the mRNA levels of TG synthetic genes and adipogenic maker genes (p < .01) . Moreover, overexpression of KLF3 upregulated all the potential target genes, except for C/EBP alpha. These results suggested that KLF3 is a positive regulator for subcutaneous adipocyte differentiation in goats.

ID AICHI VIRUSES
AB Caprine kobuvirus (CKoV), a member of the genus Kobuvirus, has only been identified in South Korea and Italy until now. In this study, 24 goat diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 3 farms in Sichuan province, China, and 87.5% (21/24) samples were detected as CKoV positive by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, full-length VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes were simultaneously cloned from 17 clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all CKoV strains were most closely related to porcine kobuvirus based on amino acid (aa) sequences of VP0 and VP3 proteins, but CKoV strains were closely related to with Aichivirus B strains (ferret, bovine, and sheep kobuvirus) based on aa sequences of the VP1 protein. Interestingly, compared with known CKoV strains in the GenBank database, Chinese CKoV strains have unique amino acid changes in VP0 and VP1 proteins. Moreover, the first Chinese CKoV nearly complete genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named SWUN/ F11/2019. Compared with the two known CKoV strains, five aa mutations (S60A, L252I, V267T, I, V 306 L, V331I) were found in the VP0 gene and 7 aa mutations (S57N, G, T243A, V244I, T, A248V, L, S251A, R252H, and M255L) were found in VP1 in the SWUN/F11/2019 genome. This was the first report of the detection and molecular characteristics of CKoV from goats in China, which could be helpful for improving the understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of CKoV.

AB Carbon retention within river corridors influences ecosystem processes of catchments and regulates regional to global carbon budgets. Previous studies lack focus of carbon retention associated with meandering river migration. To fill the gap, this study concentrated on particulate organic carbon (POC) retention by point bars that built via hydrogeomorphic processes within meandering river corridors. We selected a typical meandering river (White River) in Zoige Basin of the Tibetan Plateau to conduct field works in the growing seasons of 2016, 2018, and 2019. We found (i) concentration of POC retained within point bars was 0.17%-2.52%, three to five times significantly lower than on general areas of floodplain, and did not show downstream trends; (ii) POC was homogeneously distributed within individual point bars, whereas the positions pioneer plants invaded had significantly higher concentrations; (iii) the order for POC concentration within the river corridor was: positions of bars without plants (1.08%) < positions of bars with pioneer plants (2.96%) < general area of floodplain (5.65%); (iv) the frequency of pioneer plants invasion increased downstream by advantage of the widened channel. Hydrogeomorphic processes through building point bars exerted an intense influence in modifying the POC concentration within the meandering river corridor.

AB Cattleyak, which are interspecific hybrids between cattle and yak, display much higher growth performances than yak. However, F1 male cattleyak are infertile due to defective testicular development. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a histone deacetylase that is essential for various biological processes, while the roles of testicular SIRT1 in yak and cattleyak are still poorly understood. Here, we found that SIRT1 was localized in various kinds of yak testicular cells except elongated spermatids while it was deficient in cattleyak testis. Further studies indicated that cattleyak testis exhibited decreased histone acetylation levels on H3 and H4. One of SIRT1 co-factors, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), was lost in cattleyak testis at protein level. Expressions of several SF-1 target genes responsible for Sertoli cell development and steroidogenesis, includingSTAR,CYP11A1,CYP26B1, FDX1andHSD3B,decreased significantly in cattleyak testis. In addition, SIRT1-mediated P53 acetylation was not responsible for the cell apoptosis in cattleyak testis. Taken together, our results suggested the deficiency of SIRT1 in yak testis caused inactivation of SF-1 and the impairment of testicular development. This research provides theoretical bases for understanding the mechanism of cattleyak sterility and gives new insights in revealing the roles of SIRT1 in regulating yak testicular development.

AB To gain an insight into understanding how the silica network generated from hydrolysis and condensation of silicic acid, derived from sodium silicate, enhancing hydrothermal stability and mechanical properties of the leather, and particularly which active groups playing a main role for interaction of silica with collagen protein molecules, herein, effects of incorporated amino or carboxyl groups on the properties of silicic acid modified gelatin (GE) membrane were intensively studied. We found when lots of amino groups were introduced by adding a modified melamine, the thermal denaturation temperature, uniformity of pore diameter distribution and mechanical strength of GE membrane distinctly increased, while incorporating plenty of carboxyl groups by adding low polymerization degree acrylic acid polymer, no obvious change of performances of GE film was discovered. In addition, utilization of gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane had a positive effect on the porosity and flexibility of GE membrane. Importantly, our results indicated that hydrogen bonding probably played the most important role toward improving performances of porous GE film when treated with silicic acid. These findings are greatly beneficial for developing a chrome-free tanning technology based on silicon containing materials, and are also suggestive for fabricating porous silica-GE hybrid materials using sodium silicate as a precursor.

AB Proto-oncogene c-Myc plays an essential role in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), since downregulation of c-Myc inhibits intestinal polyposis, which is the most cardinal pathological change in the development of CRC. Herein, a series of novel phenoxy-N-phenylaniline derivatives were designed and synthesized. The cytotoxicity activities of all the derivatives were measured by MTT assay in different colon cancer cells, 4-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-(((4-methoxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)phenoxy)-N-phenylaniline (42) was discovered, the lead compound 42 with excellent cytotoxicity activity of IC50 = 0.32 mu M, IC50 = 0.51 mu M, in HT29 and HCT 15 cells, respectively. Compound 42 had a good inhibitory activity of cMyc/MAX dimerization and DNA binding. Besides, compound 42 could effectively induce apoptosis and induced G2/M arrest in low concentration and G0/G1 arrest in high concentration to prevent the proliferation and differentiation in colon cancer cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the 42 strongly down-regulated expression of c-Myc. Furthermore, during 30 days treatment 42 exhibited excellent efficacy in HT29 tumor xenograft model without causing significant weight loss and toxicity. Consequently, 42 could be a promising drug candidate for CRC therapy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the convergence analysis on the guaranteed robust H-infinity control for master-slave generalized uncertain neural networks (GUNNs). Synchronization problems are raised up due to the existence of the disturbance loading and parameter uncertainties. In order to cope with the encountered robustness issues, a dual geometric sequence division-dependent augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is newly constructed, which contains state variable-based integral forms with unfixed intervals. Meanwhile, the convex combination technique is employed to deal with not only the parameter uncertainties but also the derivative of delay (tau)over dot(t). To ensure the GUNNs to be globally asymptotically stable with the guaranteed H-infinity performance in the case of disturbance and parameters uncertainties, a controller is designed using the liner matrix inequalities technique. Numerical examples show that, in the sense of the prescribed H-infinity performance, this proposed work achieves expected results on the error synchronization system.

AB Recently, various inorganic nanomaterials have been used as fluorescence anisotropy (FA) enhancers for biosensing successfully. However, most of them are size-uncontrollable and possess an intensive fluorescence quenching ability, which will seriously reduce the accuracy and sensitivity of FA method. Herein, we report a two-dimensional DNA nanosheet (DNS) without fluorescence quenching effect as a novel FA amplification platform. In our strategy, fluorophore-labeled probe DNA (pDNA) is linked onto the DNS surface through the hybridization with the handle DNA (hDNA) that extended from the DNS, resulting in the significantly enhanced FA value. After the addition of target, the pDNA was released from the DNS surface due to the high affinity between the hDNA and target, and the FA was decreased. Thus, target could be detected by the significantly decreased FA value. The linear range was 10-50 nM and the limit of detection was 8 nM for the single-stranded DNA detection. This new method is general and has been also successfully applied for the detection of ATP and thrombin sensitively. Our method improved the accuracy of FA assay and has great potential to detect series of biological analytes in complex biosensing systems.

AB The black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) which inhabits high-altitude areas has the largest body size of theworld's 15 crane species, and is classified as threatened by the IUCN. To support further studies on population genetics and genomics, we present a high-quality genome assembly based on both Illumina and nanopore sequencing. In total, 54.59 Gb Illumina short reads and 116.5Gb nanopore long reads were generated. The 1.23 Gb assembled genome has a high contig N50 of 17.89 Mb, and has a longest contig of 87.83Mb. The completeness (97.7%) of the draft genome was evaluated with single-copy orthologous genes using BUSCO. We identified 17,789 genes and found that 8.11% of the genome is composed of repetitive elements. In total, 84 of the 2,272 one-to-one orthologous genes were under positive selection in the black-necked crane lineage. SNP-based inference indicated two bottlenecks in the recent demographic trajectories of the black-necked crane. The genome information will contribute to future study of crane evolutionary history and provide new insights into the potential adaptation mechanisms of the black-necked crane to its high-altitude habitat.

AB This paper studies the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics under a general directed graph. We propose two observer-based output feedback event-triggered control schemes with the novel triggering condition to solve the problem. It is shown that the consensus of the controlled multi-agent system can be achieved asymptotically. The feasibility of the proposed control scheme is further verified by excluding Zeno behavior for each agent. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synthetic promoters (SPs) have many advantages over their natural counterparts, especially with regard to transcriptional activity and tissue specificity. Here, we report a new strategy to construct SPs for efficient and muscle-specific gene expression. First, 19 nucleic acid motifs classified to 3 kinds of transcriptional regulatory elements were rationally selected. A recombinant promoter library was constructed by randomly assembling these motifs. Second, the transcriptional activities of similar to 1200 SPs were screened by intramuscular expression of several reporter genes in different cell lines for activity higher than that of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, with SP-301 finally identified as the strongest. A single intramuscular injection of mice with an SP-301 plasmid expressing mouse growth hormone releasing hormone accelerated mouse growth significantly over 24 days. Third, the muscle specificity of SP-301 was confirmed in transgenic mice. Finally, in comparison with the CMV promoter, SP-301 accelerated translocation and increased the level of plasmid in the nuclei of myoblast cells to a greater extent than in non-muscle cells. Altogether, the study has provided a more rational strategy to construct efficient and tissue-specific promoters, with the promoter SP-301 exhibiting promising potential for establishing an intramuscular gene expression system for therapeutic applications.

AB The Sichuan partridge (Arborophila rufipectus, Phasianidae, Galliformes) is distributed in south-west China, and classified as endangered grade. To examine the evolution and genomic features of Sichuan partridge, we de novo assembled the Sichuan partridge reference genome. The final draft assembly consisted of approximately 1.09 Gb, and had a scaffold N50 of 4.57 Mb. About 1.94 million heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, 17,519 protein-coding genes were predicted, and 9.29% of the genome was identified as repetitive elements. A total of 56 olfactory receptor (OR) genes were found in Sichuan partridge, and conserved motifs were detected. Comparisons between the Sichuan partridge genome and chicken genome revealed a conserved genome structure, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Arborophila possessed a basal phylogenetic position within Phasianidae. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of positively selected genes (PSGs) in Sichuan partridge showed over-represented GO functions related to environmental adaptation, such as energy metabolism and behavior. Pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent analysis revealed the recent demographic trajectory for the Sichuan partridge. Our data and findings provide valuable genomic resources not only for studying the evolutionary adaptation, but also for facilitating the long-term conservation and genetic diversity for this endangered species.

ID 1ST REPORT
AB Severe brown leaf spot disease was observed on Paris polyphylla var. chinensis in Sichuan Province, China, in 2017 and 2018. The initial symptoms were many light-brown small spots with necrotic centres, round or irregular in shape, becoming dark brown, gradually enlarging and eventually coalescing, causing extensive leaf senescence. A fungus was isolated from diseased leaves showing typical symptoms of brown leaf spot. The isolates were cultured on potato sucrose agar, and their morphological characteristics of the causal pathogen were observed under a light microscope. Pathogenicity tests revealed that this fungus was the causal pathogen of the disease. Molecular analyses of the sequences of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) and the RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RBP2) gene were conducted to confirm the identity of the pathogen. The multi-gene phylogeny indicated that the causal agent was Alternaria tenuissima. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. tenuissima causing brown leaf sports on P. polyphylla var. chinensis in China.

AB To fully investigate the diarrhea of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted agents in cancer patients. The relevant studies of the randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) in cancer patients treated with HER2-targeted agents were retrieved, and the systematic evaluation was conducted. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched for articles published until August 2018. Forty-two RCTs and 21 633 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggested that the use of HER2-targeted agents significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade diarrhea (RR, 2.78; 95%CI, 2.37-3.25; P < .00001) and high-grade diarrhea (RR, 4.89; 95%CI, 3.09-7.75; P < .00001). The RRs of all-grade diarrhea and high-grade diarrhea varied significantly according to drug type, control group, and treatment regimen. The RR of all-grade diarrhea varied significantly according to tumor type. Afatinib and neratinib tended to associate with the highest risk of all-grade diarrhea and high-grade diarrhea, respectively. Trastuzumab was associated with the lowest risk of diarrhea. Breast cancer patients tended to have a higher risk of all-grade diarrhea than patients with nonbreast cancer when receiving a HER2-targeted agent. The available data suggested that the use of HER2-targeted agents is associated with a significantly increased risk of diarrhea in cancer patients.

In order to obtain less conservatism, an improved delay partitioning method is introduced, which divides the delay interval into multiple segments with a geometric sequence. A modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed and some less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria are derived by using linear matrix inequalities technique. Then a non-fragile controller is designed. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Wireless sensor networks (WSNs); ambient RF energy harvesting; ambient

AB The ambient radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting technology has recently been regarded as a potential solution for powering the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the ultra-low power density of ambient RF energy is the main impediment to its further application. In this paper, we propose a novel energy efficient cooperative communication scheme (EECCS), which combines energy beamforming communication and ambient backscatter communication, to overcome the energy problem of WSNs powered by ambient RF energy harvesting. Moreover, to further reduce the energy consumption of nodes, we present an optimal resource allocation problem for EECCS. It can be formulated as a signomial geometric programming (SGP), which is nonconvex and NP-hard. We develop a Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm for finding a solution of this SGP problem, which transforms the SGP problem into a sequence of geometric programming (GP) problems that are convex. The simulation results indicate that the EECCS can improve the energy efficiency of the ambient RF powered WSNs and maximize the total amount of data received by the sink.

AB A highly enantioselective (91- > 99% ee) Michael addition of alpha-nitroacetate to alpha,beta-unsaturated pyrazolamide was developed in the presence of a bifunctional squaramide. Satisfactory isolated yields (42%-99%) have been achieved with a wide range of alpha,beta-unsaturated pyrazolamides, albeit acceptor of this type displayed poor reactivity in the precedent reports. The adducts resulting from this protocol are useful synthetic intermediates for further synthetic modification.

AB Background: The mucositis of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies was poorly understood. We conducted this systematic review to fully investigate the mucositis of antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in cancer patients.
   Study design: EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for articles published till December 2017. The relevant randomized controlled trials in cancer patients treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted.
   Results: Thirty-six randomized controlled trials and 15,364 patients were included. The current meta-analysis suggests that the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.24-1.77; P < 0.0001) and high-grade mucositis (RR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.61-2.89; P < 0.00001). The relative risk of high-grade mucositis tended to be higher in colorectal cancer patients than non-colorectal cancer patients.
   Conclusions: The available data suggested that the use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies significantly increases the risk of developing mucositis. Physicians should be aware of mucositis and should monitor cancer patients when receiving anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies.

The effects of the addition of Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3 on phase structure, microstructure, and electrical properties were studied in detail. The rhombohedral-tetragonal (R-T) phase boundary was established in the ceramics with 0.03 <= x <= 0.04. Owing to the both R-T phase boundary and the enhancement of dielectric and ferroelectric properties, an optimal electrical property (e.g., d (33) = 450 +/- 5 pC/N, k (p) = 0.50 +/- 0.02, and T (C) = 252 A degrees C) was attained in the ceramics with x = 0.03. As a result, constructing phase boundary is proved to be a good way to improve the electrical properties in KNN-based ceramics.

AB Recently, theranostic candidates based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) providing the combination of therapy and diagnosis have become one of the most promising system in cancer research. However, poor stability, premature drug release, lack of specific tumor cell targeting, and complicated multi-step synthesis processes still hinder them for potential clinical applications. In this research, the multi-functional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs-DOX) were prepared via a simple assembly process for targeted delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging detection. Firstly, the multi-functional copolymer coating, polyamidoamine (PAMAM), was designed and synthesized by Michael addition reaction, where N,N-bis(acryloyl)cystamine served as backbone linker, and DOX, dopamine (DA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) acted as comonomers. The PAMAM was then directly assembled to the surface of SPIONs by the ligand exchange reaction with SPIONs forming the MNPs-DOX. The hydrophilic PEG moieties provide the nanoparticles with colloidal stability and good-dispersity in aqueous solution. Comparing with the quick release of free DOX, the drug release behavior of MNPs-DOX exhibited a sustained drug release. Because the chemical cleavage of disulfide in the polymer backbone, a high cumulative drug release up to 60% in GSH within 48 h was observed, rather than only 26% in PBS (pH 7.4) without GSH. The MR imaging detection experiment showed that the MNPs-DOX had an enhanced T-2 relaxivity of 126 mM(-1) S-1 for MR imaging. The results of the cytotoxicity assays showed a remarkable killing effect of cancer cells by MNPs-DOX due to the FA tumor-targeting ligand, comparing with non-targeted drug molecules. All the results showed that the as prepared multi-functional magnetic nanoparticles may serve as a promising theranostic candidate for targeted anticancer drug delivery and efficient detection through MR imaging in medical application.

AB In this work, accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations were used to study different effects of G286F and R126 mutations on the activity of CCR5. Potential of Mean Force (PMF) results indicate that there are stable inactive-like states and active-like ones existing in the conformation space of the wild type (WT), confirming that CCR5 could possess to some extent constitutive activity. But the R126N mutation could constrain CCR5 in the inactive state through influencing the TXP motif and limiting the movements of TM5 and TM6. In contrast, the G286F mutation promotes the activity of the receptor by increasing the distance of TM2-TM6 and the flexibility of the intracellular part of TM5 and changing the H-bonding in the TXP motif. The observations from the cross correlation analysis further show that the R126N mutation dramatically reduces the motion correlations between TMs, which should partly contribute to the deactivation of CCR5. Compared with the WT system, TM6 and TM7 in the G286F mutant are loosely correlated with other regions, which should be conducive to drive the movement of TM6 and TM7 toward the active conformation. In addition, the result from the protein structure network (PSN) analysis reveals that the shortest pathways connecting the extracellular and the intracellular domains are highly conserved in the three systems despite the different mutations, in which the hydrogen bond plays a pivotal role. However, the G286F mutation shortens the lifetime of the pathway with respect to the R126N mutation, which may be associated with the different activities of the two mutants. The pathway connecting the ligand-binding site and the G-protein region reveals that the allosteric communication between TM6 and TM7 is enhanced by the R126N mutation while the G286F mutation induces the activation of the G-protein pocket by arousing more residues in the NPxxY region to participate in the pathway.

A total of 120 weanling pigs (24-day-old) were used in a 5-week feeding trial. Pigs were allotted into three dietary treatments: CON, basal diet; LA, CON + 0.1% lactic acid bacteria complex; EF, and CON + 0.1% E. faecium DSM 7134. From days 0 to 14, days 15 to 35, and the overall period, average daily gain was higher (P < .05) in EF than that in CON. Higher gain: feed ratio was also observed in EF compared with CON during the overall period. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen, and gross energy was greater (P < .05) in LA and EF compared with CON on days 14 and 35. Faecal Lactobacillus counts were increased (P < .05) and faecal pH was decreased in LA and EF compared with CON on days 14 and 35. Results of the current study indicated that E. faecium DSM 7134 has better effects on growth performance than lactic acid bacteria complex in weanling pigs.

AB Background: There are limited data on neurobiological correlates of poor insight in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study explored whether specific changes occur in small-world network (SWN) properties in the brain functional network of OCD patients with poor insight.
   Method: Resting-state electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded for 12 medication-free OCD patients with poor insight, 50 medication-free OCD patients with good insight, and 36 healthy controls.
   Results: Both of the OCD groups exhibited topological alterations in the brain functional network characterized by abnormal small-world parameters at the beta band. However, the alterations at the theta band only existed in the OCD patients with poor insight.
   Limitations: A relatively small sample size. Subjects were naive to medications and those with Axis I comorbidity were excluded, perhaps limiting generalizability.
   Conclusions: Disrupted functional integrity at the beta bands of the brain functional network may be related to OCD, while disrupted functional integrity at the theta band may be associated with poor insight in OCD patients, thus this study might provide novel insight into our understanding of the pathophysiology of OCD.

AB A novel redox-sensitvie core cross-linked micelles based on disulfide-linked PEG-polypeptide hybrid polymer were prepared and demonstrated for anticancer drug delivery, where N,N-bis(acrylate) cystamine (BAC) served as cross-linker, allyl-terminated poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) methyl ether methacrylate acted as comonomers. The molecular structure and characteristics of the cross-linked micelle and the precursor were confirmed by H-1 NMR and FT-IR. The cross-linked micelles could be easily degraded into individual linear short chains (M-n = 1800) in the presence of 20 mM glutathione (GSH) by the cleavage of the disulfide linkages from the cross-linker BAC. Doxorubicin (DOX) was selected as a model anticancer drug and encapsulated into the micelles with a decent drug loading content of 21.6 wt%. Compared to the burst release of free DOX in first 6 hours, the in vitro release studies revealed that the micelles exhibited a sustained and high cumulative drug release in GSH (up to 86%) within 24 h, rather than the relatively low release rate of 62% in PBS (pH 7.4). Cell cytoxicity experiments showed that the obtained micelles exhibited nontoxic, and the drug-loaded micelles exhibited high anti-cancer efficacy. All the results showed that the designed cross-linked PEG-polypeptide hybrid micelles may be a promising vehicle for anticancer drug delivery with stimuli-triggered drug release behavior in reducing environment.

AB In the work, we mainly used molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and protein structure network (PSN) to study subtilisin Carlsberg (SC) immobilized onto carbon nanotube (CNT) in water, acetonitrile and heptane solvents, in order to explore activation mechanism of enzymes in non-aqueous media. The result indicates that the affinity of SC with CNT follows the decreasing order of water > acetonitrile > heptane. The overall structure of SC and the catalytic triad display strong robustness to the change of environments, responsible for the activity retaining. However, the distances between two beta-strands of substrate-binding pocket are significantly expanded by the immobilization in the increasing order of water < acetonitrile < heptane, contributing to the highest substrate-binding energy in heptane media. PSN analysis further reveals that the immobilization enhances structural communication paths to the substrate-binding pocket, leading to its larger change than the free-enzymes. Interestingly, the increase in the number of the pathways upon immobilization is not dependent on the absorbed extent but the desorbed one, indicating significant role of shifting process of experimental operations in influencing the functional region. In addition, some conserved and important hot-residues in the paths are identified, providing molecular information for functional modification.

AB Secreted frizzled related protein 5 (SFRP5), an anti-inflammatory adipokine, is relevant to the adipocyte differentiation. In order to clarify its role in regulating intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in Tibetan chicken, the full-length sequence of the Tibetan chicken SFRP5 gene was cloned. The relative expression of SFRP5 gene was detected using quantitative RT-PCR in various tissues of 154 days old Tibetan chicken, as well as in breast muscle, thigh muscle, and adipose tissue at different growth stages. The results showed that SFRP5 gene was expressed in all examined tissues but highly enriched in adipose tissue. Temporal expression profile showed that the expression of SFRP5 was gradually decreased in breast muscle, but was fluctuated in thigh muscle and adipose tissue with the growth of Tibetan chicken. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated that the expression of SFRP5 in breast muscle, thigh muscle and adipose tissue was correlated with IMF content at different levels. The results indicated that Tibetan chicken SFRP5 is involved in IMF deposition.

AB Objective: The aims of this study were to demonstrate the hepatoprotective activity of herpetin (HPT) and the enhanced hepatoprotective efficiency of liposomal herpetin against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in mice. Methods: Herpetin was isolated from Herpetospermum seed and identified by ESI-MS and NMR. To enhance liver targeting and improve solubility of HPT, liposomal HPT was prepared with optimal formulation. The intravenous injection safety of the liposomes was then evaluated. Further, the hepatoprotective effects of liposomal HPT on model mice were investigated by the comparison of different liver marker enzymes and histopathological examination. Results: The prepared HPT liposome showed spherical or ellipsoidal vesicles with the entrapment efficiency of 94.50 +/- 2.15% and particle size of 119.2 +/- 10.7 nm. After 4 days intravenous administration of liposomal herpetin, no obvious damage could be observed at the injection site of each group. The liposomal HPT has no destructive effect on erythrocytes and little influence on whole blood clotting time. Free HPT exhibited only a weak protective function to model mice, whereas an enhanced hepatoprotective activity was observed using liposomal herpetin for treatment. Conclusion: The hepatoprotective efficiency of herpetin is able to be promoted through pharmaceutical application of liposome and liposomal herpetin is a promising new medicine for hepatoprotection.

AB To determine the level of genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among Tibetan yak populations, the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (COIII) genes of 378 yak individuals from 16 populations were analyzed in this study. The results showed that the length of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 gene sequences was 781 bp, with nucleotide frequencies of 29.2, 29.4, 26.1, and 15.2% for T, C, A, and G, respectively. A total of 26 haplotypes were identified, with 69 polymorphic sites, including 11 parsimony-informative sites and 58 single-nucleotide polymorphism sites. No deletions/insertions were found in sequence comparison, indicating that nucleotide mutation types were transitions and transversions. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.562 and 0.00138, respectively, indicating a high level of genetic diversity in Tibetan yak populations. Phylogenetic relationship analysis indicated that Tibetan yak populations are divided into 2 groups.

AB A novel quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, dual-group QPSO with different well centers (DWC-QPSO) algorithm, is proposed by constructing the master-slave subswarms. The new algorithm was applied in the parameter optimization of on-ramp traffic PI controller combining with nonlinear feedback theory. With the critical information contained in the searching space and results of the basic QPSO algorithm, this algorithm avoids the rapid disappearance of swarm diversity and enhances the global searching ability through collaboration between subswarms. Experiment results on an on-ramp traffic control simulation show that DWC-QPSO can be well applied in the study of on-ramp traffic PI controller and the comparison results illustrate that DWC-QPSO outperforms other evolutionary algorithms with enhancement in both adaptability and stability.

AB Achieving microecological balance is a complex environmental challenge. This is because the equilibrium of microecological systems necessitates both the eradication of harmful microorganisms and preservation of the beneficial ones. Conventional materials predominantly target the elimination of pathogenic microorganisms and often neglect the protection of advantageous microbial species. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent physicochemical properties (such as crystalline particles of various dimensions with highly porous network topology, variable local networking structures, diverse compositions with functional groups, high specific surface areas and pore volumes for surface and porous guest molecular adsorption/adhesion/affinity/binding and separation) have been extensively studied as a type of bactericidal material. However, only recently, studies on using MOFs to protect microorganisms have been reported. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms and applications of various MOFs (such as ZIF-8, ZIF-90, HKUST-1, MOF-5, and MIL-101) in both microbial eradication and protection. Insights into previous studies on MOF development, the material-bacteria interaction mechanisms, and potential clinical and environmental applications are also elucidated. MOFs with different framework structures/topologies (zeolite, sodalite, scaffolding, diamond, one-dimensional, and spherical/cylindrical cavities/pore networks), particle dimensions, polyhedral, cubic, rod and open/uncoordinated metal centers or fully coordinated metal centers, and ligand functional groups are discussed to understand the varying degrees of activation and interaction of microorganisms. This review holds potential in guiding future research on the design, synthesis, utilization, and integration of MOFs for the targeted eradication and protection of microorganisms and generating novel MOFs with selective antimicrobial and protective properties. Moreover, this review delivers a timely update and outlines future prospects for MOFs and their interaction with microorganisms, emphasizing their potential as a promising candidate among the next generation of smart materials in the field of ecosystem regulation.

AB Cholesterol (CHO) is an essential lipid in cell membranes and a precursor for vital living substances. Abnormal CHO levels can cause cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, simple and accurate monitoring of CHO levels is crucial for early diagnosis and effective management of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we report a beta-cyclodextrin- based supramolecular photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) biosensor for naked-eye visual CHO detection. This sensor is composed of a poly(acrylamide-co-N-isopropylacrylamide-co-maleic anhydride-beta-cyclodextrin) smart hydrogel with embedding Fe3O4 colloidal chains, which can translate CHO concentration signals into visually detectable color changes of the hydrogel. By carefully selecting a macromolecular crosslinker, a macroporous structure of the hydrogel was achieved, significantly enhancing CHO responsiveness. Molecular docking provides detailed information about the binding mode between MAH-beta-CD and CHO. The cyclohexanol portion and alkyl chain of CHO molecule are inserted into MAH-beta-CD cavity, driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, this sensor demonstrates excellent regenerability and could be facilely regenerated by washing using hot/cold water or acid solution. Furthermore, it is highly selective for CHO and is suitable for detecting actual human serums. Such a beta-CD-based supramolecular PCH biosensor with visualization, excellent regenerability, and high sensitivity and selectivity toward CHO, provides a basis for clinical diagnosis of diseases relative to CHO abnormalities.

AB The invasion of Eimeria causes damage to the intestinal barrier, nutrient leakage, and microbial imbalance in poultry. We aimed to investigate the effects of Eimeria infection on growth performance, intestinal integrity, and cecal microbial diversity and composition of yellow broilers. A total of 180 male yellow broilers were randomly divided into an unchallenged control and an Eimeria challenge treatment group within 18 floor pens (10 chicks/ pen, 9 replicate pens/group). On day 10, 90 chicks received a cocktail of E. maxima, E. acervulina, and E. tenella oocysts (105/chick) to induce coccidial infection, and the other 90 received an aliquot of PBS. The Eimeria challenge resulted in increased bird feed consumption and FCR from day 11 to 21 (all P < 0.01). Higher fecal Eimeria counts, duodenal, jejunal, and cecal lesions were observed in the challenge group on day 12, 15, 15, 18 respectively (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the infected birds had larger livers and small intestines, deeper villus crypt, and decreased expression of Claudin-1 on day 21 (all P < 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that alpha diversity (Sobs, Shannon, Simpson, Ace, or Chao) of cecal microbials was not affected by Eimeria challenge (all P > 0.05). However, the PCoA and LEfSe analyses indicated that the Eimeria challenge altered microbial distribution by decreasing the abundance of Firmicutes and enriching the abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level. At the genus level, Clostridia vadin BB60 and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group were reduced, while Escherichia-Shigella were enriched in the challenged yellow broilers (all P < 0.05). Correlation analyses demonstrated that the birds with higher Lachonospiraceae NK4A136 group and Clostridia vadin BB60, and lower Escherichia-Shigella in their cecal content gained more BW and reached a lower FCR from day 11 to 21 (all P < 0.05). In conclusion, Eimeria infection compromised feed efficiency of yellow broilers by damaging intestinal barrier and shifting cecal microbiota towards colonizers associated with poor performance. Restoring the dysbiotic microbiome could be a potential strategy for improving feed efficiency in yellow broilers under coccidial challenge.

DE Patchouli essential oil; Ulcerative colitis; Reactive oxygen species
ID BLETILLA-STRIATA POLYSACCHARIDE
AB Patchouli essential oil (PEO) is acknowledged as a potent contender for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the limited ability of PEO to be absorbed by the body and its low stability substantially limit its potential uses. Furthermore, UC lesions are mainly concentrated in the rectal and colonic mucosa, with excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, a nanoemulsion of PEO (PEONE) was developed to enhance the stability and bioavailability of a drug. Subsequently, we developed a novel platform for the rectal administration of a ROS/thermo dual-sensitive Bletilla striata polysaccharide-based hydrogel (RTH) co-loaded with PEONE to efficiently treat UC. As expected, the sol-gel transition of PEONE@RTH, after its intrarectal administration, resulted in its extended presence in the colon and facilitated its attachment to the inflammation site. Moreover, PEONE@RTH alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC symptoms by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, repairing the damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier (claudin-1 and occludin), increasing short-chain fatty acid content and inhibiting the MAPK signalling pathway. Additionally, PEONE@RTH exhibits exceptional safety and biocompatibility. Thus, PEONE@RTH has the potential to provide a novel approach for treating UC and other intestinal disorders characterised by similar clinical conditions.

   DESIGN
AB This paper studies the stability problem of sampled-data-based load frequency control (LFC) doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-integrated wind power system (WPS). Firstly, a unified fuzzy DFIG-integrated WPS model is constructed by analyzing the nonlinear aspects of governor and turbine dynamics. Secondly, a sampled-data-based fuzzy proportional-integral control strategy (FPICS) is designed for stabilizing the power system. Thirdly, some new stability criteria are established by Lyapunov theory. Additionally, an improved trapezoidal algorithm is proposed to process the integral term in the controller, which can effectively reduce the consumption of computing resources. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed algorithm and the FPICS are verified through simulations. Note to Practitioners-Due to nonlinearities in the power system arising from the physical limitations of non-reheat governors, this paper aims to design an appropriate control strategy to address the nonlinear issues arising from governor valve position limiting, which may adversely affect the stability of the power system. Specifically, we propose an FPICS to tackle the nonlinearities caused by governor valves. Besides, an improved trapezoidal algorithm, which can dynamically determine and utilize the minimal number of subintervals according to the controller output variation, is designed to fit the numerical values of the controller's integral term. This ensures control signal accuracy while maximizing computational resource savings. Moreover, to enhance the system's tolerance to significant delays and disturbances, this paper considers the time-varying delay in the controller and establishes new stability criteria. Finally, through theoretical analysis and simulation cases, the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed fuzzy control strategy and improved trapezoidal algorithm are validated.

AB The objective of the study was to comprehensively assess flavor and metabolomic disparities in the aroma and taste profiles of kiwi wine (KW) derived from kiwifruits with green (Hayward), red (Donghong), and yellow (Jinshi) flesh. The findings revealed that Hayward wine exhibited the most "floral, fruity and pleasant" aromas, while Donghong wine demonstrated the most "sweet, fullness and balanced" tastes. In KW, a total of 106 compounds were characterized using a flavor-directed research strategy and metabolomics. PCA and PLS-DA effectively differentiated the three types of KW based on their aroma and taste characteristics. Ten volatile compounds (ethyl isovalerate, ethyl hexanoate, isoamyl acetate-D, acetone, hexyl acetate-M, hexyl acetate-D, ethyl isobutyrate, 2-butylfuran, 2-pentylfuran and 2-methylbutanal) and ten non-volatile compounds (malate, lactate, hydroxyacetone, pyroglutamate, succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, galactarate, acetoin, pyruvate and proline) were identified through multivariate analysis as key discriminators of flavor and metabolomic differences among the three types of KW. Furthermore, several metabolic pathways were investigated to distinguish the KW fermented with the three flesh-colored kiwifruits, mainly pertaining to glycerolipid, amino acid, sucrose, butanoate and pyruvate metabolism. This study could offer valuable insights into the effect of flesh colors on the flavor and metabolomic characteristics of KW.

AB Human serum albumin (HSA) serves as a crucial indicator for therapeutic monitoring and biomedical diagnosis. In this study, a near infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, termed BTPA, characterized a donor-pi-acceptor (D-pi-A) structure based on bridged triphenylamine (TPA) was developed. BTPA exhibited outstanding sensitivity and selectivity towards HSA among various analysts, with a remarkable 50-fold fluorescence enhancement with a significant Stokes shift (similar to 190 nm) and a wide linear detection range of 0-20 mu M of HSA. Especially, BTPA displayed selectivity for discrimination of HSA from BSA. Job's Plot analysis suggested a 1:1 stoichiometry for the formation of the BTPA-HSA complex. Displacement assays and molecular docking demonstrated that BTPA binds to subdomain IB of HSA which could effectively avoid interference from most drugs. Besides, BTPA have good biocompatibility and could detect of exogenous HSA with a relatively low fluorescence background. For practical applications, BTPA was tested for detecting HSA levels in human urine without any pretreatment, showing detection capability in the range of 0-10 mu M with a fast response (<30 s), a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.12 mu M and good recoveries (81.7-92.9 %), highlighting the high performance of bridged triphenylamine-based probe BTPA.

AB With the rapid advancement of rural revitalization in China, protecting regional culture and construction techniques of traditional ethnic groups, while incorporating green energy-saving concepts, has become increasingly vital. With Sware ITES2023 as the simulation tool, this article conducts a comparative study on the green building technology and thermal comfort of traditional Tibetan residential houses in Songpan, Sichuan Province, and the new residential houses that villagers have incessantly renovated and built in the past two decades, thus demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of traditional houses and newly-built houses in terms of green building technology elements, such as stone and wood structures, roof floors, walls, doors, and windows, therefore developing an optimized design scheme, which includes the eastern direction of a building's orientation, concrete frame and wooden structure, brick wall and stone masonry, and optimized door and window size selection. This scheme will improve indoor thermal comfort by two to three times by calculation. Through preliminary simulation and deduction, the optimized design scheme combines traditional architectural culture and ethnic characteristics with green and energy-saving concepts. This provides a design paradigm that can be promoted and popularized for the construction of residential buildings in high-altitude ethnic areas of western Sichuan and also lays the foundation for future protection and research of traditional residential architecture.

AB The Yak (Bos grunniens) is a special breed of livestock predominantly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in beef cattle is a vital indicator of meat quality. In this study, RNA-Seq and Protein-Seq were respectively employed to sequence the transcriptome and proteome of the longissimus dorsi (LD) tissue from 4-year-old yaks with significant differences in IMF content under the same fattening conditions. Five overlapping genes (MYL3, ACADS, L2HGDH, IGFN1, and ENSBGRG00000000-926) were screened using combined analysis. Functional verification tests demonstrated that the key gene ACADS inhibited yak intramuscular preadipocyte (YIMA) differentiation and proliferation, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis gene expression, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Furthermore, co-transfection experiments further demonstrated that interfering with ACADS reversed the effect of PPAR alpha agonists in promoting lipid differentiation. In conclusion, ACADS potentially inhibits lipid deposition in YIAMs by regulating the PPAR alpha signalling pathway. These findings offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying yak meat quality.<br />

AB Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the lesion site or specific cells is an important way to achieve "toxicity reduction and efficacy enhancement". Macrocycles have always provided many novel ideas for drug or gene loading and delivery processes. Specifically, macrocycles represented by crown ethers, cyclodextrins, cucurbit[n]urils, calix[n]arenes, and pillar[n]arenes have unique properties, which are different cavity structures, good biocompatibility, and good stability. Benefited from these diverse properties, a variety of supramolecular drug delivery systems can be designed and constructed to effectively improve the physical and chemical properties of guest molecules as needed. This review provides an outlook on the current application status and main limitations of macrocycles in supramolecular drug delivery systems.

AB Beer melanoidins, the final products of the Maillard reaction (MR), play a critical role in determining the flavor stability of beer due to their antioxidant properties. This study investigated the structure, stability, and antioxidant activity of lager beer melanoidins (LBM) and ale beer melanoidins (ABM). The results revealed that ABM possessed a higher browning index and molecular weight, attribute to its relatively intense MR. However, this intensity also led to a more unfolded and disordered structure in ABM. Conversely, LBM outperformed ABM in the FAST index, thermal stability, and total antioxidant activity because the low alcohol content in lager beer reduced oxidation and thermal degradation while boosting the stability and antioxidant activity of melanoidins. As a result, it would offer a novel possibility to improve beer flavor stability by optimizing the brewing process to modify the structural and functional characteristics of melanoidins.

AB Recently, dye and microorganism have become the main sources of water pollution due to the rapid development of modern industries and wantonly draining of living sewage. Therefore, the efficient removal of dye and microorganism from the wastewater have attracted considerable attentions of the scientists and engineers around the world. In this regard, a novel phenyl boronic acid (PBA) modified electro-spun Fe doped carbon nanofibrous membrane, C/Fe@PBA, was fabricated in this study for simultaneously selective removal of dye and efficient inhibition of bacteria in water. Firstly, the C/Fe@PBA displayed selective adsorption towards Congo Red (CR) among other dyes by the adsorption order of CR>Methyl Orange (MO) > Neutral Red (NR) > Methylene Blue (MB) > Malachite Green (MG) > Rhodamine B (RhB) with adsorption ability at 25.75, 8.41, 7.11, 7.02, 5.41, and 3.13 mg & sdot;g(- 1). The pseudo first order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm model is calculated to better match the adsorption process of the as prepared membrane towards CR. After 7 rounds of adsorption desorption or 5 degradation cycles, the carbon membrane showed a removal efficiency of 62.2 % or 57.4 %, respectively. Furthermore, the C/Fe@PBA can be employed as effective catalyst to degrade CR in presence of H2O2 under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation by the photothermal effect, and the possible catalytic mechanisms and degradation pathway were proposed. Moreover, the as prepared membrane exhibited high bactericidal rate of 99.94 % and 97.44 % against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), respectively. In conclusion, the as prepared carbon membrane with ability of selective adsorption, catalytic degradation, and bacterial inhiation is a promising candidate of filtration membrane in practical sewage management.

AB The outstanding performance of advanced oxidation processes based on self-generated active species in the decomposition of antibiotics has attracted widespread attention. Herein, a novel heterojunction flower-shaped microsphere Iron-based Hydroxide/Tungstate Antimony Oxide (FSW) composed of nanosheets with synchronous persulfate activation and photocatalytic properties were proposed to achieve efficient degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) by enhanced active oxidation species. Constructed FSW/PMS/vis system realized the improved removal of SDZ at pH 2-6, with a degradation efficiency of 96.6 % in just 6 min (electron transfer efficiency, 6.19 x 10-4 A/cm2; kinetic rate, 2-ORR). Investigation of density functional theory demonstrated the superiority of FSW catalysts (Eads =-1.63 eV), indicating that FSW can not only enhance the adsorption of PMS but also activate PMS to generate a large number of free radical ions, realizing rapid carrier movement and effective charge transfer, which highlights the application prospects of the system in eliminating antibiotics in environmental water bodies.

AB Resilience refers to a firm's capacity to foresee, prevent, and adapt to disruptive events and environmental changes. Previous research has explored the antecedents of resilience from perspective of resources and capabilities, but there has been limited attention paid to strategic orientation, particularly sustainability orientation (SO). In light of the growing importance of sustainability in response to various social issues, this study investigates how SO in digital context can enhance firm resilience by driving digital business model innovation (DBMI). The study also examines the moderating effects of digital orientation (DO) and environmental dynamism (ED) on the relationship between SO and DBMI based on contingency theory. We tested our hypothesis using survey data from 155 Chinese SMEs. The results show that: (i) SO can improve firm resilience, (ii) DBMI plays a mediating role between SO and resilience, and (iii) the interplay of SO and DO can create stronger DBMI, but the synergy between them will be weakened in more dynamic environment.

AB This study separated, purified, and identified mango polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in Xiaotainong mango, and the inactivation effect and possible inactivation mechanism of mango PPO by ultrasound (US) was investigated. The purified mango PPO, identified as Alfonso mango chloroplast PPO (NCBI number: XP:044462061.1), exhibited specific enzyme activity of 178,192 U/mg, with a yield of 1.2%, which was 9.85-fold higher than crude enzyme solution. Bioinformatics analysis of XP_044462061.1 indicated that the PPO consisted of a stable hydrophilic protein with a molecular weight of 66.77 kDa, an amino acid number of 593, and a structural domain similar to the TYROSINASE_1 (PS00497, tyrosinase) CuA and TYROSINASE_2 (PS00498; tyrosinase) CuB binding regions. The result showed that increased US treatment intensity and time better facilitated PPO inactivation, with a higher US intensity performing better than extended treatment time. US changed and disrupted the secondary and endogenous hydrophobic structures of the mango PPO, altered the exogenous hydrophobicity, and caused PPO molecule aggregation, ultimately leading to PPO inactivation. This article provided a theoretical basis for the application of US technology for processing mango products.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are strongly controlled by plant roots. Yet, how variation of root traits under precipitation change influences SOC stability remains unclear. As part of a 5 -year field experiment manipulating precipitation including 90 % (0.1P), 50 % (0.5P), 30 % (0.7P) decrease, and 50 % increase (1.5P), this study was designed to assess the effects of changing precipitation on root traits and production dynamics by minirhizotron and examine how such influences regulate SOC stability in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai -Tibetan Plateau. We found that root length density (RLD), specific root length (SRL), root branching intensity (RBI), and root residue carbon input (RC input) exhibited no significant response, whereas root turnover (RT), root carbon (C), nitrogen (N) concentrations and C/N ratio were altered by precipitation change with nonlinear trends. Absorptive root RT positively correlated to manipulated precipitation within the interannual precipitation range in topsoil, but it showed no significant change under extreme drought treatment. Alpine meadows can maintain the SOC content and density under varied precipitation. However, it showed significant variation in aggregate stability and organic carbon (OC) distribution in aggregates in topsoil, which were mainly due to the strong direct effects of soil moisture and partly related to RLD and RC input of transport roots. Although subsurface soil aggregate stability and OC associated with aggregates were not modified, our results indicated a risk of SOC stability variation in subsurface soil if absorptive root RT and SRL changed. These findings provide vital information to predict responses of SOC dynamics of alpine meadow to future climate change.

AB Oversampling-based methods achieve impressive performance for classifying imbalanced data. However, many existing oversampling algorithms are still very sensitive to noise. Besides, these algorithms also require one or more parameters, how to set these parameters is very challenging. Furthermore, the generated samples by these algorithms are meaningless or unsafe. To solve these problems, a novel oversampling algorithm for unbalanced classification is presented, named Natural Local Density-based Adaptive Oversampling algorithm (NLDAO). NLDAO has four main advantages: (a) it does not need any parameter due to the use of natural neighbors to calculate local density; (b) it applies a noisy filter to remove noises, which makes the sample boundary cleaner so that the proposed method is robust to noise; (c) it unevenly distributes the generated samples to the minority class, which maintains the original characteristics and enhances the boundary classification ability; (d) it determines the generated region by tracking the sample proportion drop that declines the randomness of the synthesized and reduces the noisy generation. Finally, in experiments, we apply the NLDAO algorithm to artificial datasets to visually demonstrate its effectiveness. Moreover, intensive experiments on real datasets show that NLDAO can achieve better performance than state -of -the -art methods.

AB Natural environmental preservatives are widely used in wooden building materials due to their low toxicity, renewable, and degradable properties. Inspired by the long-lasting durability of Tibetan paper, we propose for the first time to fill the pores of wood materials with the extract of Stellera chamaejasme root to improve their fungal resistance. The extract not only inhibits the secretion of lignin degrading enzymes by fungi but also inhibits the growth of fungal hyphae. Therefore, the growth inhibition rates of wood rot and mold fungi both reach 100% when the concentration of the extract is higher than 0.75%. The composite wood treated with Stellera chamaejasme extract has good fungal resistance. The mass loss rate of composite wood is only 5.26% at 22(degrees)C for 12 weeks during a relative humidity (RH) of 75%, which is 49.34% lower than that of the blank sample. Excellent fungal resistance and easy-to-industrial modification method are beneficial for the further commercialization of wood building materials. Graphical abstractExtract of Stellera chamaejasme root can significantly improve the wood's ability to resist decay and mold.

AB Increased expression of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 represents an inflammatory response in cells and tissues. Macrophage polarization and autophagy are major functions in inflammatory macrophages; however, the cellular functions of the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis in macrophages are not well understood. Here, we examined the role of CXCL10-CXCR3-axis-regulated autophagy in macrophage polarization. First, in non-inflammatory macrophages, whereas CXCL10 promotes M2 polarization and inhibits M1 polarization, CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 induces the opposite macrophage polarization. Next, CXCL10 promotes the expression of autophagy proteins (Atg5-Atg12 complex, p62, LC3-II, and LAMP1) and AMG487 inhibits their expression. Knockdown of LAMP1 by short interfering RNA switches the CXCL10-induced polarization from M2 to M1 in non-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, in inflammatory macrophages stimulated by poly(I:C), CXCL10 induces M1 polarization and AMG487 induces M2 polarization in association with a decrease in LAMP1. Finally, AMG487 alleviates lung injury after poly(I:C) treatment in mice. In conclusion, CXCL10-CXCR3 axis differentially directs macrophage polarization in inflammatory and non-inflammatory states, and autophagy protein LAMP1 acts as the switch controlling the direction of macrophage polarization by CXCL10-CXCR3.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Gentiana species, known as the traditional Tibetan medicine "Bangjian," have been integral to clinical practice for millennia. Despite their longstanding use, our understanding of the variation in chemical constituents and bioactive effects among different species is limited. Aim of the study: In the present study, we aimed to assess the differences in chemical profiles and bioactivities among four Gentiana species (G. veitchiorum, G. trichotoma, G. crassuloides, and G. squarrosa) and explore potential bioactive markers. Materials and methods: The chemical composition of the four Gentiana species was analyzed using UPLC-QEOrbitrap-MS. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was compared through DPPH, ABTS, and reducing power assays. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by measuring the inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-6 (IL -6), and tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF-alpha) by RAW264.7 macrophages. Additionally, compounds strongly correlated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities were identified through spectrum-effect relationship analysis. Results: A total of 50 compounds were identified across the four Gentiana species. In vitro antioxidant assays demonstrated DPPH and ABTS scavenging abilities and reducing power within the concentration range of 62.5-2000 mu g/mL. All four species inhibited the production of NO, IL -6, and TNF-alpha in RAW264.7 cells. Spectrum-effect relationship analysis revealed that gentiascabraside A, gentiatibetine, tachioside, lutonarin, and isotachioside were associated with the highest antioxidant activity; and swertiamarin, tarennoside, eleganoside C, and alpigenoside were associated with the highest anti-inflammatory activity. Conclusions: This study presents, for the first time, the chemical profiles and bioactivities of G. trichotoma, G. crassuloides, and G. squarrosa, which were comprehensively compared with those of G. veitchiorum. The findings provide novel insights to understand the traditional use and/or expand the current use of Gentiana species. Additionally, this research highlights the potential of Gentiana species as natural sources of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, suggesting promising applications in tea production or medicinal contexts in the near future.

AB In recent years, with the growing demand for oceanic exploration, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have gained intensive research interests. In UWSNs, the prevailing routing algorithms predominantly utilize either acoustic or optical waves for data transmission with some of them employing hybrid acoustic-optical strategies. However, none of these algorithms considers the distinct characteristics of both media for heterogeneous data packets characterized by diverse priority (e.g., importance level), which limits their efficiency. A hybrid acoustic-optical routing algorithm based on packet hierarchy and void processing (PHVP) is proposed to address this challenge. The proposed PHVP algorithm employs a hybrid strategy by delivering the data with high importance via optical waves and the ones with low importance via acoustic waves to reduce transmission delay. Besides, the proposed algorithm also employs a hybrid two-stage void handling mechanism, which utilizes the characteristics of both acoustic and optic waves to realize a two-stage void processing strategy. This mechanism reduces the probability of packet loss in void regions and thereby raises packet delivery rate (PDR). In addition, by comprehensively considering the divergence angle and energy of network nodes during routing, the proposed PHVP algorithm reduces the consumed energy in UWSNs and prolongs their lifetime. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed PHVP algorithm significantly obtains about at least 36% and 73% improvements in PDR and network lifetime when compared to the classical routing algorithms adopted in the simulations.

AB This study aimed to investigate the role of the yeast cell wall and membrane in enhancing osmotic tolerance by antioxidant dipeptides (ADs) including Ala-His (AH), Thr-Tyr (TY), and Phe-Cys (FC). Results revealed that ADs could improve the integrity of the cell wall by restructuring polysaccharide structures. Specifically, FC significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the leakage of nucleic acid and protein by 2.86% and 5.36%, respectively, compared to the control. In addition, membrane lipid composition played a crucial role in enhancing yeast tolerance by ADs, including the increase of cell membrane integrity and the decrease of permeability by regulating the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids. The up-regulation of gene expression associated with the cell wall integrity pathway (RLM1, SLT2, MNN9, FKS1, and CHS3) and fatty acid biosynthesis (ACC1, HFA1, OLE1, ERG1, and FAA1) further confirmed the positive impact of ADs on yeast tolerance against osmotic stress.

AB Silicon (Si) and boron (B) are a class of elements called metalloids, which have properties like metals and non-metals. Si is classified as a quasi-essential element, while B is a micronutrient element for plants. Nowadays, numerous discoveries have shown the analogy of silicon and boron in plant nutrition. In this minireview, the molecular mechanisms for the transport of these two metalloids are compared. We also discussed the chemical forms of Si and B and their functional similarity in response to environmental stresses in plants. In conclusion, it can be proposed that cell wall-bound silicon rather than silica might partially replace boron for plant growth, development, and stress responses, and the underlying mechanism is the Si contribution to B in its structural function.

AB Homocitrate is an organic component in the active site of nitrogenases (N2ase), where their cofactors are in the forms of [Delta-MoFe7S9C(R-Hhomocit)(N-his)(S-cys)], [Delta-VFe7S8C(CO3)(R-Hhomocit/homocit)(N-his)(S-cys)], and [Delta-FeFe7S9C(R-Hhomocit/homocit)(N-his)(S-cys)] (FeMo/V/Fe-cos) respectively, which are based on highresolution crystallography, XES (XES = X-ray Emission Spectroscopy), ESEEM (ESEEM = Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation), and cryogenic electron microscopy. The protonated form of FeMo-co is set up on IR (Infra-red), VCD (Vibrational Circular Dichroism) spectroscopies and the comparisons of model complexes with protein structures in different oxidation states. Homocitrate ligand coordinates with molybdenum through its alpha-alcoholic and vicinal carboxyl groups, which is served as a possible proton source during the N2 reduction. Here a brief review has been given on the isolations, spectroscopies and structural characterizations of molybdenum and vanadium homocitrates and their homologs, including citrates, malates, tartrates, lactates and glycolates. The structures and configurations of Mo/V-homocitrato complexes are compared with the coordination environments of molybdenum, vanadium and iron atoms in FeMo/V/Fe-cos. Theoretical calculations for the protonation of alpha-alkoxido group in homocitrate of FeMo-co were also reviewed. A delivery pathway of hydrogen is suggested for the protonation and deprotonation of homocitrate in FeMo/V-cos.

AB Salt is a key ingredient that can both enhance the taste and extend the shelf life of fermented vegetables. However, it is important to note that excessive salt levels can have adverse effects on consumer health. This study aimed to investigate the impact of various salt additions (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% wt/wt) on the flavor profile of fermented ciba pepper, a traditional Chinese fermented chili sauce, using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) in combination with an electronic nose (E-nose). Fermented ciba pepper samples were prepared with different salt additions: 2% (LJA), 4% (LJB), 6% (LJC), 8% (LJD), and 10% (LJE) (wt/wt). The physicochemical and sensory properties of the fermented ciba pepper samples were evaluated. Sensory evaluation indicated that LJC and LJD received higher scores compared to the other groups. The total acid and amino acid nitrogen contents displayed contrasting trends with the salt additions (p < 0.05). The E-nose analysis successfully differentiated the flavor profiles of the ciba pepper samples fermented with varying salt additions. Additionally, the GC-IMS analysis identified a total of 72 volatile compounds, including 14 alcohols, 21 esters, nine aldehydes, four acids, eight ketones, three terpenes, and eight other substances. Notably, the ciba pepper samples with lower salt additions exhibited higher levels of alcohols, aldehydes, and esters. In conclusion, the addition of salt during the fermentation process significantly influenced the formation of flavor compounds in ciba pepper. This study provides valuable insights into ciba pepper fermentation with different salt additions and offers prospects for the development of low-salt fermented ciba pepper products.

AB Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition and increased precipitation are known to alter soil microbial communities. However, the combined effects of elevated N deposition and increased precipitation on soil microbial community dynamics and co -occurrence networks in temperate forests remain elusive. In this study, we conducted a field manipulation experiment by applying N solution and water to the forest canopy to simulate natural N deposition and increased precipitation in a temperate forest. We collected samples in the litter layer, organic soil layer, and mineral soil layer in 2018-2019 after 6-7 years of N and water treatments, and explored how elevated N deposition and increased precipitation regulate soil microbial diversity, community composition, and co -occurrence networks in different soil layers and at different sampling times. We found that the effects of N deposition and increased precipitation on soil microbial communities varied with soil layers and sampling times. Compared to the ambient environment, single canopy N addition (CN) or single canopy water addition (CW) did not affect bacterial Shannon diversity in the mineral soil layer in 2018, but the combined canopy N and water additions (CNW) decreased it in this layer at this time. CN increased fungal OTU richness in the organic and mineral soil layers in 2018; however, CW and CNW did not have an effect on it in the same layer at the same time. CW and CNW, but not CN, significantly affected bacterial and fungal community compositions in the litter layer in 2018 and in the organic soil layer in 2019. In contrast, CN, but not CW or CNW, significantly affected fungal community composition in the litter layer in 2019. CNW exhibited higher complexities of bacterial and fungal co -occurrence networks than CN and the ambient environment, indicating increased precipitation can strengthen the effect of N deposition on the complexity of bacterial and fungal co -occurrence networks. Our findings suggest that increased precipitation alters the effects of atmospheric N deposition on soil bacterial and fungal communities in this temperate forest, depending on soil layer and sampling time. Moreover, both bacterial and fungal community compositions are sensitive to increased precipitation, but the bacterial community composition is more sensitive to N deposition than the fungal community composition in the organic and mineral soil layers in this forest.

AB In analogy to the cell microenvironment in biology, understanding and controlling the active-material microenvironment (ME@AM) microstructures in battery electrodes is essential to the successes of energy storage devices. However, this is extremely difficult for especially high-capacity active materials (AMs) like sulfur, due to the poor controlling on the electrode microstructures. To conquer this challenge, here, a semi-dry strategy based on self-assembled nano-building blocks is reported to construct nest-like robust ME@AM skeleton in a solvent-and-stress-less way. To do that, poly(vinylidene difluoride) nanoparticle binder is coated onto carbon-nanofibers (NB@CNF) via the nanostorm technology developed in the lab, to form self-assembled nano-building blocks in the dry slurry. After compressed into an electrode prototype, the self-assembled dry-slurry is then bonded by in-situ nanobinder solvation. With this strategy, mechanically strong thick sulfur electrodes are successfully fabricated without cracking and exhibit high capacity and good C-rate performance even at a high AM loading (25.0 mg cm-2 by 90 wt% in the whole electrode). This study may not only bring a promising solution to dry manufacturing of batteries, but also uncover the ME@AM structuring mechanism with nano-binder for guiding the design and control on electrode microstructures.
   To better control the electrode microstructure, especially for high-capacity sulfur cathodes, a semi-dry strategy is reported to construct nest-like robust microenvironment of active material skeleton in a solvent-and-stress-less way. Along with compression and lean solvent dosage, the self-assembled dry slurry made by nanostorm technology is bonded by in situ nanobinder solvation. Mechanically robust thick sulfur cathode can be prepared and deliver excellent electrochemical performance.image

AB Efficient demulsification of emulsions is crucial in heavy oil transportation, interfacial reactions, and emulsion polymerization applications. Surfactants that are responsive to the environment have the ability to alter their surface activity in a dynamic manner. However, these types of surfactants typically require a significant amount of energy and may be less efficient. The present study involved the preparation of a surfactant with dynamic covalent bonding and pH-responsive property. This was achieved through the creation of dynamic imine bonds between decyloxybenzaldehyde (DOBA) and sodium 3-amino-1-propanesulfonate (AP) via a Schiff base reaction to synthesize dynamic covalent surfactant CB. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of various pH environments on the conversion rate and interfacial tension of surfactant CB. To achieve this objective, 1H NMR, FTIR, and IFT tests were conducted. The results confirmed the reversible conversion of the dynamic imine bond with pH. Furthermore, the dynamic imine bonded surfactant demonstrated the ability to complete at least three emulsification-breakage cycles. The present investigation introduces a novel approach for the synthesis of pHresponsive surfactants through the utilization of dynamic covalent bonds.

AB Understanding the food-energy-water nexus (FEWN) among industries' input-output activities is vital for the management of regional strategic resources. However, identifying key nexuses and quantifying their effects within an economy-wide dimension remain a challenge. This study integrated the frameworks of social network analysis (SNA) and computable general equilibrium (CGE) methods based on input-output data, presenting a new methodology to assess inter-industrial FEWN in China. Results indicated that: (1) Agriculture and catering industries were the principal food provision industries in the national economy. They also linked production activities among the food, energy, and water (FEW) sectors. (2) Fossil energy extraction industries with high betweenness centrality were the product circulation media in the industrial network. Their increased outputs could clearly boost domestic production. For instance, the yield of most national industries was expected to expand by 0.5 %-1.5 % due to a 10 % increase in coal supply. The electricity and petroleum processing industries with the highest response coefficients were the mainstays of China's economy. They exerted wide-ranging effects on other industries through short input-output paths. (3) Water-related industries could readily use products and services from other sectors and create demand-driven effects on FEW industries. In contrast, the output scale of national industries was not sensitive to changes in water input. These findings also highlighted the importance of conducting a FEWN evaluation within a balanced macroeconomic system. The proposed SNA-CGE analytical framework showcased good applicability and accuracy in the context of China and could serve as a reference method for FEWN research in other regions.

AB Seneca Valley Virus (SVV), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is an emerging porcine virus that can cause vesicular disease in pigs. However, the immune evasion mechanism of SVV remains unclear, as does its interaction with other pathways. STING (Stimulator of interferon genes) is typically recognized as a critical factor in innate immune responses to DNA virus infection, but its role during SVV infection remains poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that STING was degraded in SVV-infected PK-15 cells, and SVV replication in the cells was affected when STING was knockdown or overexpressed. The STING degradation observed was blocked when the SVV-induced autophagy was inhibited by using autophagy inhibitors (Chloroquine, Bafilomycin A1) or knockdown of autophagy related gene 5 (ATG5), suggesting that SVV-induced autophagy is responsible for STING degradation. Furthermore, the STING degradation was inhibited when reticulophagy regulator 1 (FAM134B), a reticulophagy related receptor, was knocked down, indicating that SVV infection induces STING degradation via reticulophagy. Further study showed that in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (PERK)/activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) deficient cells, SVV infection failed to induce reticulophagy-medaited STING degradation, indicating that SVV infection caused STING degradation via PERK/ATF6-mediated reticulophagy. Notably, blocking reticulophagy effectively hindered SVV replication. Overall, our study suggested that SVV infection resulted in STING degradation via PERK and ATF6-mediated reticulophagy, which may be an immune escape strategy of SVV. This finding improves the understanding of the intricate interplay between viruses and their hosts and provides a novel strategy for the development of novel antiviral drugs.

AB The natural neighbor (NaN) method and its search algorithm (NaN-Searching) are widely used in many fields, including pattern recognition and image processing. NaN-Searching fundamentally overcomes the problem of the conventional nearest neighbor algorithm in selecting parameters for datasets with arbitrary shapes and achieves good results. However, this algorithm uses the conventional distance metric as the neighbor judgment criterion, which cannot accurately reflect the overall structure of the dataset in the process of neighbor search. Inspired by Newton's law of universal gravitation, we propose a NaN search algorithm based on universal gravitation (GNaN-Searching). Our algorithm calculates gravitation using the structural features of data points in the dataset, it utilizes the gravitation between data as the neighbor judgment criterion, and inherits the no -parameter and dynamic neighborhood characteristics of the NaN search algorithm. Experimental results show that the natural neighborhood graph obtained by our method has a high performance in the representation of manifold data. We also applied the new method to clustering and outlier detection and achieved satisfactory results.

AB Urine microscopy is an essential diagnostic tool for kidney and urinary tract diseases, with automated analysis of urinary sediment particles improving diagnostic efficiency. However, some urinary sediment particles remain challenging to identify due to individual varia-tions, blurred boundaries, and unbalanced samples. This research aims to mitigate the adverse effects of urine sediment particles while improving multi-class detection perfor-mance. We proposed an innovative model based on improved YOLOX for detecting urine sediment particles (YUS-Net). The combination of urine sediment data augmentation and overall pre-trained weights enhances model optimization potential. Furthermore, we incorporate the attention module into the critical feature transfer path and employ a novel loss function, Varifocal loss, to facilitate the extraction of discriminative features, which assists in the identification of densely distributed small objects. Based on the USE dataset, YUS-Net achieves the mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96.07%, 99.35% average precision, and 96.77% average recall, with a latency of 26.13 ms per image. The specific metrics for each category are as follows: cast: 99.66% AP; cryst: 100% AP; epith: 92.31% AP; epithn: 100% AP; eryth: 92.31% AP; leuko: 99.90% AP; mycete: 99.96% AP. With a practical network structure, YUS-Net achieved efficient, accurate, end-to-end urinary sediment particle detection. The model takes native high-resolution images as input without additional steps. Finally, a data augmentation strategy appropriate for the urinary microscopic image domain is established, which provides a novel approach for applying other methods in urine microscopic images.

AB The reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(thioketal) (mPEG-b-PTK) copolymer was synthesized by enzyme-catalyzed polymerization for the first time. Core crosslinked (CCL) micelles were prepared via thiol-ene click reaction between the double bond of the side chain of mPEG-b-PTK and the thiol group of pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionate) as a crosslinker under UV light. The success of crosslinking was verified by NMR and IR. CCL micelles showed better stability in stability against dilution and storage stability experiments compared with the uncrosslinked (UCL) micelles. The ROS-responsiveness of CCL micelles was characterized by DLS, TEM, NMR, AFM and SEM. In vitro release studies, CCL micelles encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) showed a faster release rate of nearly 100% within 32 h in PBS containing 5 mM H2O2 compared to the control without H2O2. Cytotoxicity test demonstrated good biocompatibility of CCL micelles and low toxicity with cell viability above 82% and 86% in HeLa cells and HUVEC cells, respectively. And CCL DOX-loaded micelles exhibited great anticancer activity with IC50 value about 4.8 mg/L for Hela cells. Finally, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) showed that DOX-loaded micelles had excellent internalization efficiency in HeLa cells. The obtained ROS-responsive CCL micelles held promise for anticancer drug delivery.

AB Single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) dc-dc converter has been applied to light-emitting diode (LED) drivers with its advantages of small volume and low cost. Peak-current-mode (PCM) control of the SIDO converter has the advantages of fast transient performance and suppressed cross-regulation. A PCM-controlled SIDO buck LED driver to achieve independent dimming and to eliminate the steady-state cross-regulation is proposed in this article. The circuit and the principle of the PCM-controlled SIDO buck LED driver are presented, and its small signal model is established based on inductor current ripple. Furthermore, based on control-to-output loop gain transfer functions, control parameters of PCM-controlled SIDO buck LED driver are designed to achieve independent output current regulation of each LED driver. Besides, cross-regulation transfer functions are obtained to investigate the effect of reference signals and control parameters on the transient cross-regulation. Moreover, the effect of capacitor parameters on the stability of the LED driver is analyzed based on the bifurcation diagram. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the independent dimming capability of PCM-controlled SIDO buck LED driver with designed parameters, and the validity of the theoretical analysis on transient cross-regulation and stability of the LED driver.

ID MAXIMUM CORRENTROPY; ALGORITHM
AB Time-series prediction is a popular application that relies on the collection of historical data via sensors, which is then leveraged by predictive models to forecast future values or trends. As an important online predictive model, kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) has attracted much attention over the past decade. The traditional kernel least-mean square (KLMS) is derived based on minimizing the mean square error (MSE) criterion, which inevitably suffers from performance deterioration for nonlinear regression tasks corrupted by non-Gaussian noise. To this end, we, in this article, propose a novel robust KAF algorithm, namely a robust variable step-size kernel normalized LMS (RVSS-KNLMS) algorithm. The fundamental idea of our design is to prevent large outliers from perturbing the model training by limiting the energy of the weight update within a dynamic threshold. By establishing the energy conservation relation, we perform a rigorous analysis of the mean square convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. This analysis allows us to derive a sufficient condition for determining the appropriate step size. In addition, with the pretuned dictionary strategy that serves to simplify the nonlinear system model, we investigate the steady-state excess MSE (EMSE) of the proposed algorithm and arrive at a closed-form solution for prediction. Simulations on synthetic data and real-world data have confirmed the advantages of RVSS-KNLMS. Moreover, the theoretical steady-state analysis has been validated to provide good prediction results.

AB Interface regulation has been widely utilized to improve catalytic performance via tuning the adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, the role of metal-carbide interface in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been poorly understood. Here we construct an interface between Ni and bimetallic NiZn carbide encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni-NZC@NC) through facile pyrolysis of Ni-doped metal-organic frameworks precursor. The Ni-NZC@NC catalyst shows an excellent and stable performance for CO2RR to CO, with a CO Faradaic efficiency of 97.1% and a full-cell energy efficiency of 48.4% at a current density of 300 mA cm-2 in an alkaline membrane assembly electrolyzer. The improved CO production is attributed to the Ni-carbide interface that likely stabilizes the key *COOH intermediate and the nitrogen-doped carbon layer that facilitates *CO desorption. This work highlights the great promise of interface regulation for designing more active, selective, and stable electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion.

AB Economic development and fast growing urbanization in China have caused severe air pollution, with frequent pollution episodes endangering the health of inhabitants and disturbing social activities, and as an expanding metropolis, Chengdu has suffered ever since. The concentration variations of main air pollutants, such as PM10, PM2.5 and NO2, often show periodicity because of meteorological impact and anthropic activities, and display orientation discrepancies due to influences of wind speed (WS), frequency and pollutant sources. These features have complicated the mechanisms of pollution episodes and deepened the difficulty in pollution control evaluation. The WS has significant influences on the periodicity and orientation variations in pollutant concentrations, and quantifying the influence of which is of high significance and provides sustainable foundations for pollution alleviation strategies. Different time-scale cycles (i.e., Diurnal, weekly, seasonal and annual), along with the WS, wind frequency, wind and spatial orientations in urban areas, were analyzed in this paper. Results show that the periodicity of diurnal, seasonal and annual cycles is remarkable, and weekly cycle is obvious by adding the influence of the WS in 16 orientations. The WS has direct impacts on pollutants varying in the range of 1.5-2.5 m/s, and has a remarkable diffusion effect on pollutants once above 2.5 m/s. Over heavy pollution hours in diurnal, weekly, annual cycles and transitional seasons, the WS had more significant influences on pollutants, and whereas the wind frequency is not the main impact factor for orientation variations. For Chengdu, the northeast orientation is suitable to construct a wind panel with a remarkable diffusion effect on pollutants, while air pollutions in the northwest and southwest orientations were severe with the WS below 1.5 m/s, and pollution diffusion in the north-northwest orientation was the worst. This work can provide guidance and reference for urban planning optimization and air environment protection in cities with air quality control considerations impacted by city wind.

AB Simple Summary Chicken infectious anemia (CIA) is a prevalent immunosuppressive disease that affects poultry and is caused by the chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV). It primarily induces aplastic anemia in chickens and usually leads to subclinical infections in adult chickens. Recently, a severe disease outbreak occurred on a large-scale layer hen farm in Guangxi Province, China, housing approximately 1,000,000 20-week-old hens. The outbreak resulted in an alarming average of 550 daily deaths over a span of 10 days. Clinical symptoms prompted laboratory investigations for common avian diseases and bacterial infections in the affected layer hens. The test results revealed the presence of CIAV exclusively, strongly suggesting its significant role as the causative pathogen in this outbreak. Consequently, our study aimed to investigate the etiology and molecular characteristics of the CIAV strains present on this farm. Through our research, we identified three prevailing strains of CIAV, and subsequent animal infection experiments confirmed the high pathogenicity of the GX21121 strain. These strains caused characteristic lesions and resulted in 100% mortality in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks from 4 to 29 days post-infection (dpi). Additionally, we conducted a genetic analysis to determine the evolutionary relationships among the strains and explore the possibility of recombination. In summary, our study has provided valuable insights into the pathogenicity and genomic characteristics of the recently isolated CIAV strains. This information can serve as a reference for the prevention, control, and traceability of CIA in poultry farms. Chicken infectious anemia (CIA) poses a significant threat to the chicken industry in China. Due to its non-specific symptoms, the disease is often overlooked. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the etiology and pathology of CIA in Guangxi Province, China. Three strains of the chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) were isolated from liver samples of diseased 20-week-old chickens. The complete genomes of these strains were sequenced, and experiments on specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks revealed that the GX21121 strain exhibited high virulence. Histopathological examination of the deceased chickens showed liver cell necrosis, fibrous serous exudation, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage in liver tissues, and congestion in lung and renal tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of the genome revealed that the three strains had a close genetic relationship to the Heilongjiang wild-type strain (GenBank KY486144). The genetic evolution of their VP1 genes indicated that all three CIAV isolates belonged to genotype IIIc. In summary, this study demonstrated the genomic diversity of three CIAV strains in adult layer hens. The isolation and characterization of the GX21121 strain as a highly virulent isolate provide valuable information for further investigations into the etiology, molecular epidemiology, and viral evolution of CIAV.

AB Lysine-specific histone demethylase 2 (Kdm2a) is a regulatory factor of histone modifications that participates in gametogenesis and embryonic development. The mis-regulation of Kdm2a can lead to aberrant gene expression, thereby contributing to abnormal cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. However, due to the potential confounding effects that are secondary to the loss of Kdm2a function from the soma in existing whole-animal mutants, the in vivo function of Kdm2a in spermatogenesis for male fertility remains unknown. Herein, we focus on exploring the spatiotemporal expression profile and biological functions of Kdm2a in the spermatogenesis and fertility of male mice. A testis-specific knockout Kdm2a model (Kdm2a cKO) was established by using the Stra8-Cre/loxP recombinase system to explore the roles of Kdm2a in male fertility. Our results showed that Kdm2a was ubiquitously expressed and dynamically distributed in multiple tissues and cell types in the testis of mice. Surprisingly, Kdm2a-deficient adult males were completely fertile and comparable with their control (Kdm2aflox/flox) counterparts. Despite the significantly reduced total number of sperm and density of seminiferous tubules in Kdm2a cKO testis accompanied by the degeneration of spermatogenesis, the fertilization ability and embryonic developmental competence of the Kdm2a cKO were comparable with those of their control littermates, suggesting that Kdm2a disruption did not markedly affect male fertility, at least during younger ages. Furthermore, Kdm2a homozygous mutants exhibited a lower total number and motility of sperm than the control group and showed notably affected serum 17b-estradiol concentration. Interestingly, the transcriptome sequencing revealed that the loss of Kdm2a remarkably upregulated the expression level of Kdm2b. This effect, in turn, may induce compensative effects in the case of Kdm2a deficiency to maintain normal male reproduction. Together, our results reveal that Kdm2a shows spatiotemporal expression during testicular development and that its loss is insufficient to compromise the production of spermatozoa completely. The homologous Kdm2b gene might compensate for the loss of Kdm2a. Our work provides a novel Kdm2a cKO mouse allowing for the efficient deletion of Kdm2a in a testis-specific manner, and further investigated the biological function of Kdm2a and the compensatory effects of Kdm2b. Our study will advance our understanding of underlying mechanisms in spermatogenesis and male fertility.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cumulus granulosa cells (CGCs), an important type of ovarian somatic cells, carries out various functions related to oogenesis, follicular development, and steroidogenesis. Studying the biological mechanisms involved in the development and function of CGCs makes a great contribution to understanding the reproductive regulation in female animals. Stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) is an important Ca2 thorn -regulated glycoprotein hormone that exhibits high expression levels in ovaries. In this study, we cloned the coding sequence of the yak STC1, predicted the structure of STC1 protein, detected the expression and localization of STC1 in yak ovaries, and analyzed the functions of STC1 in yak CGCs. The CDS (coding sequence) region of yak STC1 gene was found to be 744 bp and encoded 247 amino acids. Homology comparison revealed that STC1 protein was highly conserved among mammals. The STC1 mRNA displayed dynamic expression profiles in different stages of yak ovaries, and the highest expression was found in the follicular phase. Regarding localization, STC1 protein was widely distributed in various kinds of yak ovarian cells, including oocytes, mural granulosa cells, CGCs, and thecal cells. Repressing the expression of STC1 resulted in defective proliferation and survival of yak CGCs. In addition, knockdown the expression of STC1 repressed the secretion of progesterone and promoted the secretion of estrogen. Overexpression of STC1 partially rescued the proliferation of CGCs and resulted in opposite effects on the secretion of progesterone and estrogen. Several apoptosis and steroidogenesis-related genes, including BAX, BCL2, HSD3B1, HSD17B1, CYP11A1 and CYP17A1 showed altered expressions after repressing or increasing the expression of STC1 in yak CGCs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on the role of STC1 in yak CGCs, and the outcomes offer fresh insights into the mechanism governing yak reproduction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: The endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha-X-box binding protein-1 (IRE1 & alpha;-XBP1), has been considered as a critical factor of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) in proliferation and osteogenesis. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of XBP1s, which was cleaved by IRE1 & alpha; on the proliferation and osteogenesis of hPDLCs. Methods: ERS model was induced by tunicamycin (TM); cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay; pLVXXBP1s-hPDLCs cell line was established by lentivirus infaction; expression of ERS-related protein including eIF2 & alpha;, GRP78, ATF4 and XBP1s, autophagy-related P62 and LC3, and apoptosis-related Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were detected by Western Blot; expression of osteogenic genes was detected by RT-qPCR, and senescence of hPDLCs was explored by & beta;-galactosidase staining. Furthermore, the interaction between XBP1s and human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) was examined by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT).Results: The results showed an increase in proliferation of hPDLCs from 0 to 24 h when ERS was induced by TM treatment (P < 0.05). XBP1s overexpression induced hPDLCs proliferation, upgraded autophagy and degraded apoptosis significantly (P < 0.05). In pLVX-XBP1s-hPDLCs, the ratio of senescent cells was markedly decreased after several passages (P < 0.05); After infection with pLVX-BMP2 lentiviral supernatant, IFAT result showed that XBP1s and BMP2 well co-located in the cytoplasm of pLVX-XBP1s-hPDLCs and PERK-ATF4 ERS branch was activated, meanwhile, there were obviously more mineralized nodules and mRNA expression of osteogenesisrelated genes was continually up-regulated (P < 0.05).Conclusions: XBP1s promotes the proliferation via regulating the autophagy and apoptosis, and enhances expression of osteogenic genes in hPDLCs. The mechanisms in this regard need exploring further for periodontal tissue regeneration, functionalization and clinical applications.

AB BackgroundSustainable strategies for enteric methane (CH4) mitigation of dairy cows have been extensively explored to improve production performance and alleviate environmental pressure. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and exogenous enzyme (EXE) supplementation on milk production, nutrient digestibility, enteric CH4 emissions, energy utilization efficiency of lactating Jersey dairy cows. Forty-eight lactating cows were randomly assigned to one of 4 treatments: (1) control diet (CON), (2) CON with 25 g/d XOS (XOS), (3) CON with 15 g/d EXE (EXE), and (4) CON with 25 g/d XOS and 15 g/d EXE (XOS + EXE). The 60-d experimental period consisted of a 14-d adaptation period and a 46-d sampling period. The enteric CO2 and CH4 emissions and O-2 consumption were measured using two GreenFeed units, which were further used to determine the energy utilization efficiency of cows.ResultsCompared with CON, cows fed XOS, EXE or XOS + EXE significantly (P < 0.05) increased milk yield, true protein and fat concentration, and energy-corrected milk yield (ECM)/DM intake, which could be reflected by the significant improvement (P < 0.05) of dietary NDF and ADF digestibility. The results showed that dietary supplementation of XOS, EXE or XOS + EXE significantly (P < 0.05) reduced CH4 emission, CH4/milk yield, and CH4/ECM. Furthermore, cows fed XOS demonstrated highest (P < 0.05) metabolizable energy intake, milk energy output but lowest (P < 0.05) of CH4 energy output and CH4 energy output as a proportion of gross energy intake compared with the remaining treatments.ConclusionsDietary supplementary of XOS, EXE or combination of XOS and EXE contributed to the improvement of lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, and energy utilization efficiency, as well as reduction of enteric CH4 emissions of lactating Jersey cows. This promising mitigation method may need further research to validate its long-term effect and mode of action for dairy cows.

AB Potassium ions (K+) play crucial roles in many biological processes. Abnormal K+ levels in the body are usually associated with physiological disorders or diseases, and thus, developing K+-sensitive sensors/devices is of great importance for disease diagnosis and health monitoring. Herein, we report a K+-sensitive photonic crystal hydrogel (PCH) sensor with bright structural colors for efficient monitoring of serum potassium. This PCH sensor consists of a poly(acrylamide-co-N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-15-crown-5-acrylamide) (PANBC) smart hydrogel with embedded Fe3O4 colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs), which could strongly diffract visible light and endow the hydrogel with brilliant structural colors. The rich 15-crown-5 (15C5) units appended on the polymer backbone could selectively bind K+ ions to form stable 2 : 1 [15C5](2)/K+ supramolecular complexes. These bis-bidentate complexes served as physical crosslinkers to crosslink the hydrogel and contracted its volume, and thus reduced the lattice spacing of Fe3O4 CPCs and blue-shifted the light diffraction, and finally reported on the K+ concentrations by a color change of the PCH. Our fabricated PCH sensor possessed high K+ selectivity and pH- and thermo-sensitive response performances to K+. Most interestingly, the K+-responding PANBC PCH sensor could be conveniently regenerated via simple alternate flushing with hot/cold water due to the excellent thermosensitivity of the introduced PNIPAM moieties into the hydrogel. Such a PCH sensor provides a simple, low-cost and efficient strategy for visualized monitoring of hyperkalemia/hypokalemia, which will significantly promote the development of biosensors.

AB Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial for follicle development through the regulation of granulosa cell (GC) function in some mammals, but its mechanism is unclear in yak (Bos grunniens). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of VEGF on the viability, apoptosis and steroidogenesis of yak GCs. First, we investigated the localization of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR2) in yak ovaries by immunohistochemistry analysis and evaluated the effect of culture medium containing different VEGF concentrations and culture times on the viability of yak GCs by Cell Counting Kit-8. Then, optimal treatment with 20 ng/mL VEGF for 24 h was selected to analyze the effects of this compound on intracellular reactive oxygen species levels by DCFH-DA kit, cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry, steroidogenesis by ELISA kit and the expression of the related genes by RT-qPCR. The results showed that VEGF and VEGFR2 were highly coexpressed in GCs and theca cells. GCs cultured in medium containing 20 ng/mL VEGF for 24 h significantly improved cell viability, decreased ROS production, promoted the transition from G1 phase to S phase (P < 0.05), increased the expression of the CCND1 (P < 0.05), CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, and PCNA genes (P < 0.01) and decreased the expression of the P53 gene (P < 0.05). This treatment significantly reduced GC apoptosis (P < 0.05) by promoting the expression of BCL2 and GDF9 (P < 0.01) and inhibiting the expression of BAX and CASPASE3 (P < 0.05). VEGF promoted progesterone secretion (P < 0.05) accompanied by increased expression of HSD3B, StAR and CYP11A1 (P < 0.05). Taken together, our findings highlight the beneficial influence exerted by VEGF in improving GC viability and reducing ROS production and the apoptosis rate through the modulation of related gene expression.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this work, two low-temperature co-fired silicate ceramics (CaMg0.9-xLi0.2CoxSi2O6, x = 0.15-0.75, CMLCS; CaMg0.9-yLi0.2SrySi2O6, y = 0, 0.05, 0.1-0.5, CMLSS) were synthesized via solid-state reaction method with 0.5 wt%LBSCA glass addition. CMLCS and CMLSS were densely sintered at 925 degrees C, and had good chemical compatibility with silver. Optimal microwave dielectric properties (Er = 6.71, Qxf = 30124 GHz, and zf =-79.06 ppm/degrees C) and (Er = 6.78, Qxf = 32530 GHz, and zf=-52.99 ppm/degrees C) were obtained for CMLC0.15S and CMLS0.05S respectively. With increase in Co and Sr substitution, XRD and Raman spectra showed that second phases were produced, and densification process of CaMgSi2O6-based ceramics was promoted. Dielectric con-stant was influenced by relative density, Raman shift and second phase. The parameter Qxf was affected by the FWHM of Raman peaks as well as extrinsic factors that affected the temperature coefficient of resonant fre-quency. Therefore, the results suggested the potential of these two ceramics as candidates for LTCC application.

AB The evolution of electrical properties with an electric field (E) was compared between single-phase BT ceramic and phase-coexistence BT-based (BTS-0.15BCT) ceramic. The dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and strain properties are all found to be electric field-dependent, especially for BTS-0.15BCT ceramic with small domains and easy polarization rotation induced by phase coexistence. High ferroelectric and strain properties are obtained in this ceramic because sufficient domain switching can easily be achieved. The high dielectric constant can be further elevated after poling this ceramic due to the E-induced multiphase transitions. Dynamic piezoelectric measurement reveals that the dynamic piezoelectricity can reach to similar to 740 pC/N, which is much higher than the static value (similar to 620 pC/N) of poled BTS-0.15BCT ceramic. However, the converse piezoelectric coefficient will decrease at high E, because of the quick decrease in dynamic dielectric response caused by clamped polarization at high E. All the results demonstrate that phase-coexistence BT-based ceramic shows electric field-related properties due to the soft structure, whereas it cannot be observed in BT ceramic with stable phase structure and large domains. This work reveals the evolution difference and structure origin of electrical properties in BT-based piezoceramics with different phase structures.

AB Simple SummaryTo investigate seroprevalence and identify the risk factors associated with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Pakistan's northern border region, 385 serum samples were compiled from 75 flocks/herds in seven sub-regions in this region, including sheep (n = 97), goats (n = 142), cattle (n = 60), and buffaloes (n = 86) and tested using an FMDV 3ABC-Mab-bELISA for detection of antibody to FMD virus non-structural protein. The results showed that an overall apparent seroprevalence in this region was 67.0% of the total analyzed samples, the seroprevalence in sheep, goats, cattle, and buffaloes were 51.5%, 71.8%, 58.3%, and 82.5%, respectively. From the different risk factors investigated, age, sex, species of animal, seasons, flock/herd size, farming methods, outbreak location, and nomadic animal movement in search of water and pasture from region to region were found to be significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the seroprevalence of FMD. FMD remains a significant disease of ruminants in Pakistan's northern border region. Sero-epidemiology and identification of associated risk factors of FMD is essential to bind the consequence of FMD in the region.The present cross-sectional survey was carried out to investigate the distribution and risk factors of FMD in Pakistan's northern border regions. About 385 serum samples were compiled from small ruminants (239) and large ruminants (146) and tested using 3ABC-Mab-bELISA. An overall apparent seroprevalence of 67.0% was documented. The highest seroprevalence of 81.1% was reported in the Swat, followed by 76.6% in Mohmand, 72.7% in Gilgit, 65.6% in Shangla, 63.4% in Bajaur, 46.6% in Chitral and lowest 46.5% in Khyber region. Statistically significant variations in seroprevalence of 51.5%, 71.8%, 58.3%, and 74.4% were recorded in sheep, goats, cattle, and buffaloes, respectively. From the different risk factors investigated, age, sex, species of animal, seasons, flock/herd size, farming methods, outbreak location, and nomadic animal movement were found to be significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the seroprevalence of FMD. It was concluded that proper epidemiological study, risk-based FMD surveillance in small ruminants, vaccination strategy, control measures for transboundary animal movement, collaborations, and awareness programs need to be practiced in the study regions to investigate the newly circulating virus strains in large and small ruminants and associated factors for the wide seroprevalence to plan proper control policies to bound the consequence of FMD in the region.

AB Carbon-use efficiency (CUE) has been widely used as a constant value in many earth system models to simulate how assimilated C is partitioned in ecosystems, to estimate ecosystem C budgets, and investigate C feedbacks to climate warming. Although correlative relationships from previous studies indicated that CUE could vary with temperature, and relying on a fixed CUE value could cause large uncertainty in model projections, however, due to the lack of manipulative experiment, it remains unclear how CUE at the plant (CUEp) and ecosystem (CUEe) levels respond to warming. Based on a 7-year manipulative warming experiment in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the QinghaiTibet Plateau, we quantitatively distinguished various C flux components of CUE, including gross ecosystem productivity, net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity, ecosystem respiration, plant autotrophic respiration, and microbial heterotrophic respiration and explored how CUE at different levels responded to climate warming. We found large variations in both CUEp (0.60 to 0.77) and CUEe (from 0.38 to 0.59). The warming effect on CUEp was positively correlated with ambient soil water content (SWC) and the warming effect on CUEe was negatively correlated with ambient soil temperature (ST), but was positively correlated with warming-induced changes in ST. We also found that the direction and magnitude of the warming effects on different CUE components scaled differently with changes in the background environment, which explained the variation in CUE's warming response under environmental changes. Our new insights have important implications for reducing modelling uncertainty of ecosystem C budgets and improving our ability to predict ecosystem C-climate feedbacks under climate warming.

AB In this study, the electron transfer effects of different nitrogen functional groups on palladium on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Pd/N-CNT) catalysts for the Heck reaction were systematically investigated. Pd/N-CNTs were synthesized using a practical and scalable method via chemical vapor deposition and wet impregnation to precisely control the percentage of the different N species. Structural elucidation and catalytic performance testing revealed that the synthesis temperature significantly affected Pd/N-CNT structure. Moreover, the Pd-graphitic N complex was identified as the active-site in the Heck reaction, whereas the Pd-pyridinic N com-plex functioned as an inhibitor, while the Pd-pyrrolic N and Pd-NOx complexes were spectators.

AB Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) has attracted extensive attention due to its merits in transmission latency, bandwidth, and security. However, its performance is usually significantly limited by the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects. Thus, many schemes have been proposed to enhance its performance via various optimizations at the transmitter, but most of them neglected the wavefront optimization at the receiver. Although traditional adaptive optics based on wavefront detection (AOWD) technology employing wavefront phase sensor (e.g. Shack-Hartmann sensors) and compensator (e.g. deformable mirror) was proposed to alleviate wavefront distortion, it introduced extra challenges in miniaturizing receivers for UOWC. Addi-tionally, traditional AOWD technologies usually employed costly and large computing systems, which reduced their feasibility in reality. In this paper, a novel compensation technology is proposed to optimize the distorted wavefront at the receiver based on the wavefront sensorless adaptive optics (WSAO) technique using improved genetic algorithm (GA). Instead of using the wavefront phase-detector, the proposed technology measures the light intensity via a small photo -detector (PD) and outputs voltage signals though the employed GA to manipulate the deformable mirror (DM) for wavefront compensation. The simulation results indicate that the proposed technology effectively improves the intensity distribution and the Strehl Ratio (SR) of the transmission light in UOWC.

AB This study established a direct role for FADS2 regulating TAG and fatty acid synthesis by SREBP1 transcriptional regulation in dairy goat, providing new insights into fatty acid metabolism in mammary gland of ruminants.
   Lay Summary The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) biosynthesis in mammals. This study aimed to investigate the function and transcriptional regulation mechanism of FADS2 in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). The content of triacylglycerol (TAG) was enhanced with lipid droplet accumulation in FADS2-overexpressed GMECs. Overexpression of FADS2 was positively correlated with elevated concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in GMECs. Furthermore, site-directed mutation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays simultaneously demonstrated that FADS2 was directly regulated by SREBP1 transcriptional factor binding to sterol regulatory element (SRE) in vitro and in vivo. In addition, genetic ablation of SRE1 and SRE2 in the genome resulted in a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of FADS2 via the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system. Altogether, this study discovered that the SREBP1 exerts control on FADS2 to regulate milk fatty acids, and provides a theoretical approach for improving milk quality via genetic approaches.
   Goat milk provides benefits to human health due to its richness in bioactive components, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in PUFAs biosynthesis. However, its role and transcriptional regulation mechanisms in fatty acid metabolism in dairy goat remain unclear. Here, our study revealed that the FADS2 gene was highly expressed during the peak lactation compared with the dry period, early lactation, and late lactation. The content of triacylglycerol (TAG) was enhanced with the increasing mRNA expression of TAG synthesis genes (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1/2, DGAT1/2) in FADS2-overexpressed goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). Overexpression of FADS2 was positively correlated with the elevated concentrations of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in GMECs. BODIPY staining showed that FADS2 promoted lipid droplet accumulation in GMECs. To clarify the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of FADS2, 2,226 bp length of FADS2 promoter was obtained. Deletion mutation assays revealed that the core region of FADS2 promoter was located between the -375 and -26 region, which contained SRE1 (-361/-351) and SRE2 (-191/-181) cis-acting elements of transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Overexpression of SREBP1 enhanced relative luciferase activity of the single mutant of SRE1 or SRE2, vice versa, and failed to alter the relative luciferase activity of the joint mutant of SRE1 and SRE2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and site-directed mutation assays further demonstrated that SREBP1 regulated the transcription of the FADS2 gene by binding to SRE sites in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the mRNA levels of FADS2 were significantly decreased by targeting SRE1 and SRE2 sites in the genome via the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system. These findings establish a direct role for FADS2 regulating TAG and fatty acid synthesis by SREBP1 transcriptional regulation in dairy goat, providing new insights into fatty acid metabolism in mammary gland of ruminants.

AB The robustness of the traditional A* algorithm of path planning is poor due to its excessive number of traversal nodes, slow search speed, and large turning angle. Aiming to solve the above problems, a multi-scenario adaptive A* algorithm based on extended neighborhood priority search is proposed. Firstly, this algorithm designs the heuristic function that can adapt to various scene changes by quantifying the scene map information, and the search weight is adjusted adaptively to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the algorithm. Secondly, the search strategy based on extended neighborhood priority is adopted to improve the orientation of the algorithm, and the redundant node removal strategy is used to smooth the path to reduce the number of traversed nodes and the turning angle. Finally, simulation tests are conducted in several representative map environments. The test results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional A* algorithm due to its stronger robustness and significantly improved performance metrics, with an 84.95% reduction in the number of traversal nodes, an 83.84% reduction in the number of path nodes, a 62.28% reduction in turning points on the path, a 77.38% reduction in the total turning angle, and a 58.47% reduction in the search time.

AB Uncontrolled bleeding is one of the most important causes threatening human health, but quick hemostasis remains a challenge. We prepared porous cryogels with poly beta-cyclodextrin (P beta-CD) and quaternary ammoniated chitosan (QCs). P beta-CD acts as a "water-grabbing agent" to assist QCs' ability to absorb and concentrate blood rapidly. The rat-tail amputation model and liver injury model exhibited that cryogels had excellent hemostatic performance. Moreover, cryogels showed good antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. Therefore, these cryogels can be used as potential hemostatic materials.

AB Simple Summary ACADL long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, not only a key enzyme in the initiation step of fatty acid oxidation, but also plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation. In our study, we found that ACADL promotes intramuscular adipocyte differentiation in goats via the TNF signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of adipocytes differentiation in goat intramuscular adipocytes. Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposits help improve meat quality such as marbling, juicy, flavor and tenderness. Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL) is a key enzyme for catalyzing fatty acid oxidation, and studies have shown ACADL is involved in the deposition and differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes. However, the effect of ACADL on intramuscular adipocytes differentiation in goats needs further study. In this study, to explore the mechanism of ACADL on the development of goat intramuscular adipocytes, we constructed an over-expression plasmids and a SI-RNA of ACADL to explore the function of ACADL on the development of goat IMF. It was found that overexpression of ACADL promoted the differentiation of goat intramuscular adipocytes, and promoted the expression of fat cell differentiation marker genes lipoprotein lipase (LPL), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), APETALA-2-like transcription factor gene (AP2), CCAT enhancer binding protein (CEBP alpha), preadipocyte Factor 1 (Pref-1) and CCAT enhancer binding protein (CEBP beta), and the opposite trend occurred after interference. In addition, we screened of this related tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway by RNA-Seq. So, we validate the signaling pathway with inhibitor of TNF signaling pathway. In summary, these results indicate that ACADL promotes intramuscular adipocytes differentiation through activation TNF signaling pathway. This study provides an important basis for the mechanism of IMF development.

AB Convergent evolution provides powerful opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of complex traits. The Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) and Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) belong to different subfamilies in Bovidae, but both have evolved similar superfine cashmere characteristics to meet the cold temperature in plateau environments. The cashmere traits of cashmere goats underwent strong artificial selection, and some traces of domestication also remained in the genome. Hence, we investigated the convergent genomic signatures of cashmere traits between natural and artificial selection. We compared the patterns of convergent molecular evolution between Tibetan antelope and Siberian ibex by testing positively selected genes, rapidly evolving genes and convergent amino acid substitutions. In addition, we analyzed the selected genomic features of cashmere goats under artificial selection using whole-genome resequencing data, and skin transcriptome data of cashmere goats were also used to focus on the genes involved in regulating cashmere traits. We found that molecular convergent events were very rare, but natural and artificial selection genes were convergent enriched in similar functional pathways (e.g., ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) in a variety of gene sets. Type IV collagen family genes (COL4A2, COL4A4, COL4A5, COL6A5, COL6A6) and integrin family genes (ITGA2, ITGA4, ITGA9, ITGB8) may be important candidate genes for cashmere formation and development. Our results provide a comprehensive approach and perspective for exploring cashmere traits and offer a valuable reference for subsequent in-depth research on the molecular mechanisms regulating cashmere development and fineness.

AB Tourism is currently one of the important development industries in many countries and regions, and a healthy environment is an important basis and carrier for the sustainable development of the tourism economy. Ensuring a harmonious relationship between tourism, the economy, and the environment has become one of the keys to achieving sustainable development of tourism destinations. Based on panel data on tourism, the economy, and the environment from nine provinces along the Silk Road Economic Belt from 2015 to 2019, this study has built a comprehensive evaluation index system of the tourism-economy-ecological environment (TEE). The entropy evaluation method, comprehensive evaluation model, and coupling and coordination degree model were used for quantitative analysis of the coordination development level and for assessing the spatial-temporal evolution patterns of coupling coordination for the TEE system in nine provinces along the Silk Road Economic Belt. The results show that the value of the TEE system is generally on the rise. Still, the growth rate of tourism and the economy subsystem is significantly higher than that of the environment subsystem. The coupling coordinating the development of the TEE system shows an increasing trend with a high degree of coupling. The coordination degree is relatively low, with significant gradient differences and apparent polarization. The main constraint to the coordinated development of the Silk Road Economic Belt is tourism and the economy.

ID ACTIVATION
AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ershiwuwei Zhenzhu Pill (EZP), a representative and classic formula in Tibetan medicine, is commonly used in the treatment of various cerebrovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke (IS). Nevertheless, their efficacy and potential mechanism in treating IS have yet to be investigated.Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of EZP in the treatment of IS based on network pharmacology and experimental verification.Materials and methods: The chemical profile of EZP was characterized using ultra-performance liquid chroma-tography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The targets related to the compounds in EZP were predicted by the Swiss Target Prediction and Target Net platform, and targets of IS were collected from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of targets was constructed and analyzed by the STRING database and Cytoscape software, version 3.7.1. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed, and an ingredient-target-pathway network was constructed. Ultimately, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established to evaluate the anti-IS effects of EZP by detecting the neurological deficit score, HE, Nissl and TCC staining, and inflammatory factors, and the expression of key protein targets was detected by western blotting.Results: A total of 129 components were identified in EZP. Network pharmacology revealed 3136 compound targets and 2826 disease-related targets, and 412 overlapping proteins were obtained as potential therapeutic targets. The PPI network results showed that 6 key targets (AKT1, SRC, VEGFA, TP53, TNF and EGFR) were core targets of EZP in the treatment of IS. Western blotting demonstrated that the expression levels of AKT1, VEGFA, TP53, SRC, TNF and EGFR in the brain tissue of MCAO rats were significantly changed after treatment with EZP compared to the model group.Conclusions: EZP ameliorated IS in MCAO rats. The underlying mechanism might be associated with inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis, promoting angiogenesis and protecting neurons by regulating multiple targets and pathways.

AB At present, customers' low satisfaction and loyalty to city express service have restricted the development of city express. It is particularly important to analyze the factors causing customers' low satisfaction and loyalty, which will promote the development of city express industry effectively. Based on SERVQUAL model and CCSI model, this paper constructs a new evaluation index system from the perspective of service quality. Through this new system, this paper first explores the factors that affect customers' satisfaction and loyalty, respectively, by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and hierarchical regression analysis, taking the expected and perceived service quality as conversion variables. And then it analyzes the common factors that affect customers' satisfaction and loyalty comprehensively. These two analyses will provide reference for solving the problem of low customer satisfaction and loyalty of city express enterprises. The results show that popularity and credibility, delivery time commitment, and mailing security are the common main factors affecting customer satisfaction and loyalty. Easy-to-understand receipts, the three-level index corresponding to the empathy dimension, is the most significant factor affecting customers' loyalty in city express industry; Delivery time commitment, the three-level index corresponding to the reliability dimension, is the most significant factor affecting customers' loyalty in city express industry.

AB Rh catalysts exhibit unexpected high activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline conditions, making them potential anodic catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Nevertheless, the MOR mechanism on Rh electrodes has not been clarified thus far, which impedes the development of high-efficiency Rh-based MOR catalysts. To investigate it, a combination of in situ electrochemical techniques called attenuated total refection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) is used. Cyclic voltammograms of MOR at Rh electrodes show considerable activity in alkaline media rather than acidic media, although the real-time ATR-SEIRA spectral results demonstrate that methanol can rarely self-decompose on Rh at open-circuit conditions. Meanwhile, in combination of ATR-SEIRAS and IRAS results, CO2 and formate are thought to be MOR products, suggesting a dual-pathway mechanism ("CO2 pathway" and "formate pathway"). Specifically, COad species, which are the major intermediates in the CO2 pathway, can produce at lower potentials and be oxidized into CO2 at a potential of 0.5-0.75 V. Concurrently, the formate can be produced from 0.5 V and diffuse into the bulk electrolyte to become one of the MOR products, while the further electrochemical conversion of formate to CO2 is essentially negligible. More directly, the apparent selectivity (r) of the CO2 pathway is estimated to reach ca. 0.63 at 0.9 V, confirming the potential-dependent selectivity of MOR at Rh surfaces. This study might provide fresh insights into the design and fabrication of effective Rh-based catalysts for MOR.

AB Although the fruit of Ficus tikoua Bur. has been consumed by montanic people in China for centuries, its chemical and biological composition was still unclear. A series of comprehensive investigations on its chemical constituents and bioactivities were carried out for the first time. As a result, six compounds were isolated and identified as the main components in this fruit. GC-MS analysis of the lipid components demonstrated that Ficus tikoua Bur. fruit contains some wholesome constituents such as fatty acids, vitamins, triterpenoids, and phytosterols. The fatty acids are mainly composed of linolenic acid (61.27%) and linoleic acid (22.79%). Furthermore, this fruit contains a relative high content of crude protein (9.41 +/- 0.03%), total amino acids (9.28%), and total polyphenols (0.86 +/- 0.01 g/100 g). The analysis of monosaccharide composition showed that the total polysaccharide mainly consists of glucose, glucuronic acid, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, galacturonic acid, and rhamnose. The polysaccharide, polyphenol, water, ethanol, and flavonoid extracts exhibited prominent antioxidant activity determined by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAPS methods. Meanwhile, the total polysaccharide exhibited significant immunomodulatory effect by enhancing the release of cytokines and expression of iNOS and COX-2 in RAW264.7 cells, significantly decreasing the expression of c-Jun and p65 proteins in the cytoplasm; increasing the translocation of c-Jun and p65 to the nucleus; and regulating the phosphorylation level of Akt, PI3K, and PDK1 in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study proved that the fruit of F. tikoua is a reliable source of functional food.

AB The conformational properties of hydrolysates derived from brewer's spent grain protein (BSGP) pretreatment with and without ultrasound were investigated, and the effect of BSGP hydrolysate (BSGPH) supplementation on the brewer's yeast growth and fermentation performances were examined. Results demonstrated that BSGPH had substantial influences on the biomass, viability, sugar consumption, and ethanol production of yeast. Specifically, medium supplemented with hydrolysates derived from BSGP pretreated with ultrasound (UBPH) for 4-h hydrolysis (UBPH-4) increased biomass by 7.7%, viability by 9.78%, sugar consumption by 37.16%, and ethanol yields by 20.20% (v/v), respectively, compared with the blank. UBPH-4 exhibited a looser morphology and disordered secondary structure, with a decrease in alpha-helix and increased random coil. Meanwhile, a higher proportion of short peptides and hydrophilic amino acids in UBPH-4 might account for its preferred bioactivity. All findings revealed that UBPH were effective nitrogen sources for yeast growth and fermentation.

AB Due to its prominent secretory activity, adipose tissue (AT) is now considered a major player in the crosstalk between organs, especially with skeletal muscle. In which, exosomes are effective carriers for the intercellular material transfer of a wide range of molecules that can influence a series of physiological and pathological processes in recipient cells. Considering their underlying roles, the regulatory mechanisms of adipose-secreted exosomes and their cellular crosstalk with skeletal muscle have received great attention in the field. In this review, we describe what is currently known of adipose-secreted exosomes, as well as their applications in skeletal muscle pathophysiology.

AB Herein, an albumin-enriched nanocomplex was developed for the solubilization and intravascular administration of clopidogrel bisulfate (CLP). In particular, CLP nanoparticles (HS-CLP-NPs) were synthesized via an improved nab-technology method using Solutol HS-15, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was further enriched on the nanoparticle surface forming a protein corona (BH-CLP-NPs). BH-CLP-NPs displayed an average size of 163.4 +/- 10.5 nm, a zeta potential of 1.85 +/- 0.03 mV, an encapsulation efficiency of 99.9%, and a drug loading capacity of 32.9%. The cumulative release of CLP from BH-CLP-NPs reached about 60% within 168 h. The pharmacokinetic study on the CLP metabolite indicated that the BSA-enriched nanoparticle showed greater in vivo exposure. Pharmacodynamic studies in the renal ischemia/reperfusion injury rat model further demonstrated the renal protective effect of systemically administered BH-CLP-NPs against acute kidney injury with significantly downregulated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Overall, the albumin-enriched nanocomplexes offer a neat and efficient strategy for the development of poorly water-soluble drugs to achieve intravascular administration.

AB Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus that causes respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, is widely spread worldwide, but there is no effective drug or vaccine against it. This study investigated the optimal Selenium Nano-Particles (SeNPs) addition concentration (2 - 10 mu g/mL) and the mechanism of PDCoV effect on ST (Swine Testis) cell apoptosis, the antagonistic effect of SeNPs on PDCoV. The results indicated that 4 mu g/mL SeNPs significantly decreased PDCoV replication on ST cells. SeNPs relieved PDCoV-induced mitochondrial division and antagonized PDCoV-induced apoptosis via decreasing Cyt C release and Caspase 9 and Caspase 3 activation. The above results provided an idea and experimental basis associated with anti-PDCoV drug development and clinical use.

AB The objective of this study is to determine the effect of freeze-thaw condition on the fermentation characteristics, microbial community, and aerobic stability of oat (Avena sativa) silage in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Oat forage was harvested at milk ripening stage, ensiled in vacuum-sealed bags, and then stored at (1) a constant temperature of 20 degrees C, as a control (20 group) or (2) subjected to freeze-thaw condition (alternating 20 and -5 degrees C every 12 h; S group). The quality and microbial community in the silage were measured after 1, 3, 7, 14, and 60 days of ensiling, and the aerobic stability was measured after 60 days of ensiling at room temperature or at the two treatment temperatures. The results showed that the higher the pH, the lower the concentration of lactic acid and the ratio of lactic acid/acetic acid of the samples under freeze-thaw condition, as compared to those stored at 20 degrees C. The dry matter content of 20 groups was significantly higher than S group (p < 0.05). While ash, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP), and water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) had no significant difference between two groups. Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., and Weissella spp. were the most prevalent bacterial genera in all groups. The abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in the 20 group was the highest on day 3 of ensiling (p < 0.05), and it reached the peak on day 14 in the S group, but the abundance in the S group did not exceed 50% during whole fermentation process. The abundance of Enterobacterales and the count of Escherichia coli in the S group was significantly higher than 20 group (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the lactic acid concentration was significant correlated with Lactobacillus spp. in 20 group, while correlated with Leuconostoc spp. in S group. The aerobic stability of the S group was lower than that of the 20 group (p < 0.05). The present study indicates that the freeze-thaw condition led to insufficient fermentation degree of silage by limiting the fermentation of Lactobacillus spp. and severely reduced the aerobic stability of oat silage.

AB Simple Summary The homeobox a5 (Hoxa5) is not only a critical developmental transcription factor, but also plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. In our study, we found that Hoxa5 promotes goat subcutaneous preadipocyte adipogenic and inhibits its proliferation. This provides a theoretical basis for the regulation of goat subcutaneous preadipocyte differentiation and proliferation. The homeobox a5 (Hoxa5) plays considerable roles in the differentiation and lipid metabolism of adipocytes. However, the current knowledge about the mechanistic roles and functions of Hoxa5 in goat subcutaneous preadipocyte remains unclear. Therefore, Hoxa5 loss-of-function and gain-of-function was performed to reveal its functions in adipogenesis. For differentiation, overexpression of Hoxa5 notably increased the expression of adipogenic genes (PPAR gamma, CEBP/alpha, CEBP/beta, AP2, and SREBP1), as well as promoted goat subcutaneous preadipocyte lipid accumulation. Knockdown of Hoxa5 mediated by siRNA technique significantly inhibited its differentiation and suppressed the accumulation of lipid droplets. Regarding proliferation, overexpression of Hoxa5 reduced the number of cells stained with crystal violet, and inhibited mRNA expression of the marker genes including CCNE1, PCNA, CCND1, and CDK2, and also significantly reduced EdU-positive rates. Consistently, knockdown of Hoxa5 demonstrated the opposite tendency. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that Hoxa5 promotes adipogenic differentiation of goat subcutaneous preadipocyte and inhibits its proliferation in vitro.

AB A one-pot, two-step aza-Michael/Michael/Michael process was developed to diastereospecifically construct C6a,C10acis-hydrophenanthridines in a highly enantioselective manner (83-99% ee). The tricyclic products were provided in 50-99% isolated yields, sequentially promoted by bifunctional squaramide and diamine in a one-pot operation. This doubly annulative protocol indicated that the complicated polycyclic structures could be easily constructed via full employment of the available reaction sites of readily prepared precursors.

AB Aichivirus C is an emerging virus in goats, but its biological significance remains unknown. In this study, 18 diarrheic and 16 non-diarrheic faecal samples of kids were collected from a farm with an on-going diarrheic outbreak in Sichuan Province, China in May 2021. Of these samples, 77.8% (14/18) of diarrheic samples were detected as Aichivirus C positive by RT-PCR, which was significantly higher than that of non-diarrheic faces (0%, p < .001); meanwhile, other common diarrhoea-causing pathogens in goats were not detected in diarrheic samples, except for two samples that were detected as caprine enterovirus positive, suggesting that Aichivirus C was associated with goat diarrhoea. Furthermore, five Aichivirus C strains were successfully isolated from positive samples using Vero cell lines and two isolates were further plaque-purified, named SWUN/F5/2021(10(-6.7)TCID(50)/0.1 mL) and SWUN/F6/2021(10(-7)TCID(50)/0.1 mL). Interestingly, Aichivirus C strain could cause systemic infection in experimental kids via oral administration, with the main clinical manifestation being severe watery diarrhoea. Histopathological changes observed in the duodenum and jejunum were characteristic, with shedding of mucosal epithelial cells. In addition, the virus was detected in tissues of diarrhoea kids naturally infected with Aichivirus C, exhibiting pathological changes similar to those of experimental infections. Overall, this study first isolated Aichivirus C and confirmed its pathogenicity in kids, with further study needed to better understand the virus pathogenicity. As Aichivirus C has been detected in South Korea, Italy and the USA and widely prevalent in southwest China, the results obtained here have significant implications for the diagnosis and control of diarrhoea in goats.

AB Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is generally thought of as a mild, but highly contagious, enteritis of young dogs. This study was to investigate the molecular detection and characteristics of CCoV in Chengdu city, Southwest China. 218 canine fecal samples were collected from four animal hospitals and one animal shelter from 2020 to 2021. Fifty-nine CCoV-positive samples were detected by RT-PCR, including 40 CCoV-I, 25 CCoV-IIa, one CCoV-IIb and 10 untyped. To further analyze the genetic diversity of CCoV, we amplified ten complete spike (S) genes, including four CCoV-I and six CCoV-II strains. The amino acid sequence obtained in this study revealed 85.95% +/- 12.55% homology with the reference strains. Moreover, in the N-terminal structural domain, there were two amino acid insertions (17QQ18) in two strains of CCoV-I and four amino acid insertions (95IGTN98) in CCoV-IIb strain. Interestingly, we identified that the S1/S2 cleavage site of the S protein of CCoV strains (SWU-SSX3 and SWU-SSX10) were consistent with feline coronavirus (FCoV). In the evolutionary tree, a strain of CCoV-I (SWUSSX10) was found to be more closely related to FCoV, while SWU-SSX7 of CCoV-IIb was more closely related to coronavirus from the Chinese ferret badger. In addition, for the first time, recombination in a CCoV-IIb strain was found to occur between two subtypes occurring in the C domain of the S1 subunit, with a breakpoint starting at 2141 nt. The results enriched the epidemiological information of CCoV and provided an important reference for the prevention of CCoV in Chengdu city, Southwest China.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB In space-based Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), due to high satellite orbits, several Ad Hoc cells within the observation range of the satellite are vulnerable to interference by an external signal. To increase efficiency in target detection and improve system security, a blind source separation method is adopted for processing the conflicting signals received by satellites. Compared to traditional methods, we formulate the separation problem as a clustering problem. Since our algorithm is affected by the sparse-ness of source signals, to get satisfactory results, our algorithm assumes that the distance between two arbitrary mixed-signal vectors is less than the doubled sum of variances of distribution of the corresponding mixtures. Signal sparsity is overcome by computing the Short-Time Fourier Transform, and the mixed source signals are separated using the improved PSO clustering. We evaluated the performance and the robustness of the proposed network architecture by several simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in not only improving satellite signal receiving ability but also in enhancing space-based AIS security.

AB Background: This study aimed to investigate the effect of phenyllactic acid as an additive on silage fermentation and bacterial community of reed canary grass (RCG, Phalaris arundinacea L.) on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. At the heading stage, RCG was harvested, chopped and ensiled in small bag silos. The silage was treated without (control, 1.0g/ mL sterile water, on a fresh matter basis (FM)) or with phenyllactic acid (PLA, 3 mg/mL, FM), antimicrobial additive (PSB, a mixture of potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate, 2%, FM), lactic acid bacteria inoculant (LABi, L. plantarum + L. curvatus, 1 x 10(6) cfu/g, FM) and PLA + LABi, and then stored in a dark room at the ambient temperature (5 similar to 15 degrees C) for 60 days.
   Results: Compared with control, PLA decreased lactic acid, acetic acid and ammonia-N contents, and subsequently increased CP content of RCG silage. PLA enhanced the growth of lactic acid bacteria and reduced the count of yeasts (P < 0.05) in RCG silage, with reduced bacterial richness index (Chao1), observed operational taxonomic units and diversity index (Simpson). In relative to control, moreover, PLA and PLA + LABi increased the relative abundance of Lactococcus in RCG silage by 27.73 and 16.93%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Therefore, phenyllactic acid at ensiling improved nutritional quality of RCG silage by advancing the disappearance of yeasts and the dominance of Lactococcus.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB African swine fever (ASF), caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), is an acute, deadly, infectious disease of domestic pigs and wild boars and has a tremendous negative socioeconomic impact on the swine industry. ASF is a notifiable disease to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Currently, no effective vaccine or treatment against ASF is available. Early detection and rapid diagnosis are potentially significant to control ASF spread with the emerging ASFV mutant strains and non-classical symptoms. In this study, we developed a real-time recombinase-aid amplification (RAA) assay to detect the ASFV genome rapidly. Thirty samples were detected using commercial lysis buffer for DNA extraction and equipped with a portable testing instrument. The results showed that the sensitivity of RAA was 10(3) copies per reaction at 95% probability in 9 min at 39 degrees C. The method was universally specific for three strains of ASFV, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens, including foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), pseudorabies virus (PRV), and porcine parvovirus (PPV). The coefficient of variation (C.V) of repetitive experiments was 0%, and the coincidence rate was 100% compared to the real-time qPCR. 123 field samples were detected by the real-time RAA assay, and the results showed that the clinical coincidence rate of the real-time RAA assay was 98% compared to the real-time qPCR assay. The advantages of this method were as follows: the extraction of DNA can be performed on site, the DNA template is directly used, a small battery-powered instrument is easily available, and the on-site diagnostic process is finished within an hour. These suggest that this assay could be used to detect different genotypes of ASFV and play a vital role in the control of ASF.

AB The construction of ecological civilization education for art education in China's colleges and universities is based on the ecological environment. After understanding the basic situation of students, it cultivates college students' artistic exercise and lifelong artistic consciousness. The devel-opment of college art education is based on the existing campus environment, with college teachers and students as the main participants. Based on the principles of education ecology, we understand better that the art education system for college students has never been a closed system. It is an open and interactive system. The ecological environment of art education has intertwined and compli-cated, and it is restricted by many ecological factors. The various problems in the development of college students' personality indicate that there are many problems in college students' art edu-cation. If we want to improve and solve the current problems in college students' art education, we must explore scientific and comprehensive art education strategies. This article proposes the con-struction of an ecological civilization education system in art education under the background of "Internet +" education, starting from the internal and external ecological environment, exploring college students' art education countermeasures, improving college students' art education prob-lems, and promoting college students to develop a new type of healthy personality.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as the most important class of pharmacological targets regulate G-protein and beta-arrestin-mediated signaling through allosteric interplay, which are responsible for different biochemical and physiological actions like therapeutic efficacy and side effects. However, the allosteric mechanism underlying preferentially recruiting one transducer versus the other has been poorly understood, limiting drug design. Motivated by this issue, we utilize accelerated molecular dynamics simulation coupled with potential of mean force (PMF), molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) and protein structure network (PSN) to study two ternary complex systems of a representative class A GPCR (mu-opioid receptor (mu OR)) bound by an agonist and one specific transducer (G-protein and beta-arrestin). The results show that no significant difference exists in the whole structure of mu OR between two transducer couplings, but displays transducer-dependent changes in the intracellular binding region of mu OR, where the beta-arrestin coupling results in a narrower crevice with TM7 inward movement compared with the G-protein. In addition, both the G-protein and beta-arrestin coupling can increase the binding affinity of the agonist to the receptor. However, the interactions between the agonist and mu OR also exhibit transducer-specific changes, in particular for the interaction with ECL2 that plays an important role in recruiting beta-arrestin. The allosteric network analysis further indicates that Y148(3.33), F152(3.37), F156(3.41), N191(4.49), T160(3.45), Y106(2.42), W293(6.48), F289(6.44), I248(5.54) and Y252(5.58) play important roles in equally activating G-protein and beta-arrestin. In contrast, M161(3.46) and R165(3.50) devote important contributions to preferentially recruit G-protein while D164(3.49) and R179(ICL2) are revealed to be important for selectively activating beta-arrestin. The observations provide useful information for understanding the biased activation mechanism.

AB In a multi-sever scenario, a two-party remote user authentication scheme is faced with various kinds of security threats. The introduction of biometric technology can effectively improve the security on the user side and the resistance to password guessing attack. Therefore, many biometrics-based user authentication schemes have emerged in the last few years. However, in some recent authentication schemes, a server can easily impersonate a legal user by using the shared secret key and a randomly selected identity. In this study, we first analyze a study of these schemes and indicate the security weakness and vulnerability that might allow attacks. Then, we present an improved biometrics-based three-factor authentication scheme for multi-server environments that inherits most of the advantages of the original scheme and introduces digital signature to address the common security problem. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also has a simplified the authentication procedure and improves execution efficiency. Analysis results, including security analysis and performance comparison, indicate that the new scheme has good efficiency and is robust against various known attacks.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a microarray assay for the simultaneous detection of the H5, H7, H9, N1, N9 and N2 genes of the avian influenza virus (AIV) using a Nanogold-streptavidin and silver-stain-enhanced nucleic acid dot-blot hybridisation system. The conserved sequences of H5 genes from H5N1, H7 genes from H7N9, H9 genes from H9N2, N9 genes from H7N9 and N2 genes from H9N2 AIV were cloned, together with that of N1 obtained commercially, and were used as templates for generating the probes using biotin-labeled primers, which targeted the conserved regions of H5, H7, H9, N1, N9 and N2 genes, respectively. The oligonucleotide probes were diluted using the spotting buffer and ddH(2)O, and each probe was then spotted to each specific position on the microarray. The PCR products including biotin-labeled lambda, NP, H5, H7, H9, N1, N9 and N2 were mixed, 200 mu L of which was then added to the microarray chamber after denaturing. Following a hybridization incubation at 45 degrees C for 120 min, the microarray was then incubated with nanogold-streptavidin about 4 mu g/mL for 30 min. After the supplementary of 200 mu L of silver buffer A and silver buffer B in the chamber, the hybridization results were assessed by direct visualization in the dark at room temperature.
   The microarray assay was optimized and its specificity, sensitivity and stability were evaluated. The optimal conditions comprised a probe concentration of 50 mu mol/L, a hybridization temperature of 45 degrees C and a hybridization time of 2 h. The optimal concentration of nanogold-streptavidin was 4 mu g/mL and the optimal staining time was 7 min. The results of specificity evaluation showed that no cross-binding of the probes with each other and no cross-hybridization with Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus and infectious laryngotracheitis virus was observed. The optimized microarray assay was significantly more sensitivity than the reverse-transcription PCR assay. The microarray was available after storing at less 90 d at 4 degrees C. The optimized microarray assay was validated on clinical specimens and the results showed that it had over 95.6 % correlation with reverse-transcription PCR method. Therefore, the microarray assay could be used for the high throughput detection of AIV infections due to H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2.

AB The fusion (F) and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are viral entry proteins and are recognized as the major virulence determinants. Previously, a lentogenic NDV virus (CE16) was derived from a mesogenic strain (CI10) through sequential passages in chick embryos. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed that the two homologous strains shared the same F protein but differed in HN with two amino acid (aa) substitutions (A215G and T430A). To elucidate the molecular reasons for virulence attenuation, two original plasmids (HN-CI10 and HN-CE16) and two single-point mutants (G215A and A430T) reverse-mutated from HN-CE16 were constructed to analyse the known biological functions of HN. The results showed that the A430T substitution significantly weakened the haemadsorption (HAd) activity, increased the neuraminidase (NA) activity, improved the fusion-promoting activity, and enhanced the cleavage-promoting activity of HN-CE16. However, G215A failed to induce obvious functional changes. Therefore, the aa residue HN430 may play a key role in determining virulence. To test this hypothesis, further studies on A430T were conducted through reverse genetics using an infectious cDNA clone. At the viral level, the A430T-mutated virus showed dramatic promotion of viral plaque formation, propagation, and pathogenicity in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates a new virulence site associated with HN protein functions, viral propagation, and pathogenicity. All these findings could lay a foundation for illuminating the molecular mechanism of NDV virulence.

AB It has been found that fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF-FGFR) signaling can regulate the expression of adipocyte differentiation genes. FGF9 is one of the members of FGFs that mainly binds receptors FGFR2 and FGFR3. FGF9 is highly expressed in the adipose tissue of humans and mice, but there are few reports on the role of FGF9 in goat intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, this study explored the effect of FGF9 on adipocyte differentiation through cell culture, interference, and overexpression. The expression of receptors FGFR1-FGFR4 in adipocyte differentiation and their effects on differentiation were detected to screen receptor gene of FGF9. Finally, the interaction between FGF9 and the receptor was tested by cotransfection. Our results showed that FGF9 interacts with FGFR2 to inhibit goat intramuscular adipocyte differentiation by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref1), which is a data support for subsequent pathway research.

AB The identification of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and its driving factors are crucial for air pollution prevention and control. The factors that influence PM2.5 in different regions exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity. Current research has quantified the spatial heterogeneity of single factors but fails to discuss the interactions between factors. In this study, we first divided the study area into subregions based on the spatial heterogeneity of factors in a multi-scale geographically weighted regression model. We then investigated the interactions between different factors in the subregions using the geographical detector model. The results indicate that there was significant spatial heterogeneity in the interactions between the driving factors of PM2.5. The interactions between natural factors have significant uncertainty, as do those between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and socioeconomic factors. The interactions between socioeconomic factors in the subregions were consistent with those in the whole region. Our findings are expected to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms at play among the aforementioned drivers and aid policymakers in adopting unique governance strategies across different regions.

TI Interlayer polarizability in twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID MAGIC-ANGLE
AB Many of the intriguing properties of bilayer graphene (BLG) are related to interlayer electronic coupling. Since this coupling is sensitive to an applied electric field perpendicular to the layers, we develop a strategy for determining interlayer coupling by decomposing the total electric dipole polarizability, which measures the response of electrons to applied fields, into site-specific contributions and consequently the intralayer and interlayer components. The interlayer polarizability is evaluated from field-induced electron density variations computed with a first-principles approach for twisted BLG quantum dots (QDs). Changes in interlayer polarizability dominate the polarizability variation with twist angle. In addition to the well-recognized strong coupling in the Bernal stackings, enhanced coupling is revealed for the structures at small and size-dependent twist angles when AB stacking first appears in the outermost shell of the QD. The values of these magic angles depend on the QD size. This paper not only provides an approach for measuring interlayer coupling strength but also indicates the existence of strong interlayer coupling even at small twist angles, which could be important for understanding the properties of twisted BLG.

AB In this study, the reduced graphene oxide modified nickel foam (abbreviated as RGO-Ni) was used as catalytic cathode to reduce CO2/bicarbonate to produce organics in catholyte (containing 0.45 M KHCO3), driven by bioelectrochemical system. The characterization of electrode materials were tested by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Cyclic Voltammetry curves (CV). The reduction products was analyzed by Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). The power generation and the faradic efficiency of the reduction process was determined. The results indicated the RGO-Ni electrode showed much higher catalytic activity than Ni electrode or graphene oxide modified Ni electrode (GO-Ni). The results of GC-MS indicated the reduction products were ethanol (as primary product) and acetone (as by product). Over the RGO-Ni cathode, after 6 h reaction in catholyte with CO2 continuously aerated, the final concentration of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was 389 mg L-1, and the concentration of ethanol was 167 mg L-1. The process maximum power density was 0.52 W m- 2 over RGO-Ni electrode, almost 17 times of the value (0.03 W m-2) using Ni cathode. The faradaic efficiency of the process was calculated as 70%, and the reduction mechanism of CO2/bicarbonate was suggested.

AB CO2-switchable oligomeric surfactants have good viscosity-reducing properties; however, the complex synthesis of surfactants limits their application. In this study, a CO2-switchable "pseudo "-tetrameric surfactant oleic acid (OA)/cyclic polyamine (cyclen) was prepared by simple mixing and subsequently used to reduce the viscosity of heavy oil. The surface activity of OA/cyclen was explored by a surface tensiometer and a potential for viscosity reduction was revealed. The CO2 switchability of OA/cyclen was investigated by alternately introducing CO2 and N-2, and OA/cyclen was confirmed to exhibit a reversible CO2-switching performance. The emulsification and viscosity reduction analyses elucidated that a molar ratio of OA/cyclen of 4:1 formed the "pseudo "-tetrameric surfactants, and the emulsions of water and heavy oil with OA/cyclen have good stability and low viscosity and can be destabilized quickly by introducing CO2. The findings reported in this study reveal that it is feasible to prepare CO2-switchable pseudo-tetrameric surfactants with viscosity-reducing properties by simple mixing, thus providing a pathway for the emulsification and demulsification of heavy oil by using the CO2-switchable "pseudo "-oligomeric surfactants.</p>

AB In this investigation, to maximize the desired immunoenhancement effects of PsEUL and stimulate an efficient humoral and cellular immune response against an antigen, PsEUL and the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) were coupled using the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N '-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) reaction to yield a novel delivery system (PsEUL-OVA). The physicochemical characteristics and immune regulation effects of this new system were investigated. We found the yield of this EDC method to be 46.25%. In vitro, PsEUL-OVA (200 mu g mL(-1)) could enhance macrophage proliferation and increase their phagocytic efficiency. In vivo, PsEUL-OVA could significantly increase the levels of OVA-specific antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b) titers and cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-gamma) levels. Additionally, it could activate T lymphocytes and facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). These findings collectively suggested that PsEUL-OVA induced humoral and cellular immune responses by promoting the phagocytic activity of macrophages and DCs. Taken together, these results revealed that PsEUL-OVA had the potential to improve immune responses and provide a promising theoretical basis for the design of a novel delivery system.

AB Mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis and also responsible for serious threat to public health. Koumiss is a fermented mare's milk product, used as traditional drink. Here, we explored the effect of koumiss on gut microbiota and the host immune response against M bovis infection. Therefore, mice were treated with koumiss and fresh mare milk for 14 days before M bovis infection and continue for 5 weeks after infection. The results showed a clear change in the intestinal flora of mice treated with koumiss, and the lungs of mice treated with koumiss showed severe edema, inflammatory infiltration, and pulmonary nodules in M bovis-infected mice. Notably, we found that the content of short-chain fatty acids was significantly lower in the koumiss-treated group compared with the control group. However, the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis-related proteins in the lungs of koumiss-treated mice were significantly decreased. Collectively, these findings suggest that koumiss treatment disturb the intestinal flora of, which is associated with disease severity and the possible mechanism that induces lungs pathology. Our current findings can be exploited further to establish the "gut-lung" axis which might be a novel strategy for the control of tuberculosis.

AB Sufficient conditions characterizing the globally uniformly exponential stabilization of impulsive systems under two event-triggered impulsive control strategies are obtained. For the first strategy, the specific triggering condition is verified continuously, while for the second one that is discretely monitored. The second relied on a positive constant is the discrete-time version of the first one in order to reduce the computational burden. The analysis of the minimum time between two consecutive events for two control strategies is available in this paper. Moreover, the data dropout of impulsive control signals in event triggered condition is studied and the maximal permissible dropout rate is estimated under each strategy. An example and its simulation is given to demonstrate the results. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is a major cause of morbidity in dogs and is associated with several viral pathogens. The viral diversity associated with CIRD was investigated by analyzing the viral communities from nine CIRD-affected dogs using metagenomics. The results identified 10 mammalian viruses, including canine parvovirus, canid alphaherpesvirus 1, canine kobuvirus, Felis catus papillomavirus 3, canine respiratory coronavirus, canine adenovirus 2, Canis familiaris polyomavirus (DogPyV), canine coronavirus, human papillomavirus and canine pneumovirus (CPnV). Interestingly, CPnV and DogPyV were first discovered in China. Further investigation in 107 samples in China using specific PCR found only two CPnV positive strains in 51 CIRD samples and none in 56 healthy samples. Furthermore, a complete nucleotide sequence of CPnV strain SMU-2020-CB19 and a partial nucleotide sequence of strain SMU-2020-CB14 were obtained. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that both novel CPnV strains were a close match to the detected swine orthopneumovirus strain in USA, but distantly related to other CPnV strains. Here, the first discovery and characterization of orthopneumovirus in dogs with CIRD in China were reported, highlighting the need for further research on pathogenicity and transmission in China.

AB In the view of complexity theory, the emergency behavior of individual is nonlinear and influenced not only by individual variables but also by many other environmental variables. Based on complexity perspective, this article explored why employees' taking charge behavior occurs in organizations from a multilevel approach. Specifically, this study has explored the cross-level interactive effect of organization-level factor (organizational justice climate and psychological safety climate) and individual-level factor (organizational identification) on employees' taking charge behavior. Using a total of 806 valid matching questionnaires from 91 firms in China, this study found that first, organizational identification is positively related with employees' taking charge behavior. Second, distributive justice climate positively moderates the influence of organizational identification on employees' taking charge behavior. Third, psychological safety climate negatively moderates the influence of organizational identification on employees' taking charge behavior. According to our results, organizational policies and practices should be made to foster employees' identification with the organization, to construct a fair environment within the organization, and to convince employees that taking charge behavior will not entail political risks, especially for those employees with low organizational identification.

AB City landscape is an element of city image, and city landscape logo should also belong to the entire system of the city image logo. Since the reform and opening up, China's economic construction industry has attracted worldwide attention, and the improvement of people's living standards has led to the continuous development of urban construction. The original urban style is gradually replaced by high-rise buildings, the differences between cities are getting smaller and smaller, and the people living in them have gradually abandoned the inheritance of various cultures and customs. This paper aims to study the urban landscape information map and its model system based on remote sensing images. With the support of remote sensing image technology and geographic information system platform, the urban landscape information map model system is developed, which can vividly reflect the changes in the urban landscape pattern. The urban landscape information map is used to display and reveal the spatial evolution of the urban landscape in the process of urban development. Result of empirical analysis: it summarizes the methods of geoscience information map and urban landscape information map and establishes the goal and content of researching urban landscape information map. And it provides a basis for solving the problems of urban development and urban management. In 2021, Shanghai's urban areas have occupied more than 80%. It is conceivable that the area of arable land must be very small, but the area of green land still accounts for 40%; compared with last year, it is still an increase of 6%.

AB In this study, our aim is to investigate the effect of dimer procyanidin B2 [epicatechin-(4 beta-8)-epicatechin] (PB2) on porcine skeletal myofiber gene expression in vitro. Our data showed PB2 promoted the protein expression of slow myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in porcine myotubes, concomitant with the increases in mRNA levels of MyHC I, MyHC IIa and Tnni1. We also found PB2 activated AMPK signaling in porcine myotubes. NRF1 and CaMKK beta that are two important upstream factors of AMPK, and Sirt1 and PGC-1 alpha that are two major downstream factors of AMPK, were also up-regulated by PB2. The mechanism study showed the effect of PB2 on slow-twitch myofiber gene expression was abolished by AMPK inhibitor compound C or by AMPK alpha 1 siRNA. Together, we found PB2 induced porcine skeletal slow-twitch myofiber gene expression by AMPK signaling pathway.

AB Introduction The genus Aster plants have been widely used for thousands of years in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for the clearing of heat, detoxification, and the treatment of seasonal pandemic diseases. Although the presence of several flavonoid compounds in Aster has been reported by previous studies, the diversity of secondary metabolites within and among species is relatively unknown.
   Objective The metabolite profile of one Aster species was systematically compared with those of other taxa to find potential chemotaxonomic markers, delimit species, and assess chemodiversity.
   Method Samples of the above-ground parts of 11 Aster species were collected and their metabolites were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Unsupervised principal component analysis, supervised orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis, heatmap analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis were employed to analyse 95 representative samples from 11 Aster species and determine species-specific chemical markers based on a metabolomics database.
   Results Six phenolic acids and flavonoids were detected and quantified in all Aster species, suggesting that these compounds may be common constituents in the Aster genus. Metabolite analysis showed terpenoid compounds to be potential chemical markers for interspecies differentiation. Ent-kaurane-type diterpenoid glycosides were the main class of compounds in all Aster species except for A. farreri, which mainly contained oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids. Diterpenoid glycosides were low-content chemotaxonomic markers and were detected for the first time in Aster species from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   Conclusion Chemotaxonomy and metabolomics were used to support the phylogenic relationships of the Aster genus.

AB Technical analysis indicators are widely used in the field of quantitative investment, and they are usually utilized to assist in the search for profitable buy and sell points. In order to make better use of technical indicators, a method of trying to improve the performance of technical indicators by using neural network models is proposed in this work. The method tries to utilize neural network models to learn the possible patterns or features of price and volume before the profitable buy or sell points indicated by technical indicators. In modeling, a certain length of historical market data before the buy and sell points indicated by technical indicators is taken as model inputs, and whether or not can these buy and sell points meet certain profit standard is taken as labels. We validate our method on stock indexes, stocks and futures, and the results show that our method can improve the performance of several simple but common strategies based on technical analysis indicators.

AB Alkyl aluminum compounds are widely applied in organic reactions because of their high reactivities, low toxicities, and ease of preparation. The cross-coupling reaction of an organoalane compounds with organic electrophiles using a transition-metal catalyst or catalyst-free provides a simple method to synthesize a large variety of compounds and shows a higher functional group tolerance than organolithium and magnesium, which allows for additions to aldehydes in the presence of nitro, ester, hydroxyl, amino, nitrile and lactone moieties. Therefore, many organoalane reagents have found the most applications in cross-coupling reactions in recent years. In this paper, the recent research results about the alkylaluminum reagents applied in cross-coupling reactions are reviewed, involving various reaction systems.

ID INSPIRED EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM
AB Research on the merging of quantum mechanics and intelligence algorithms has received extensive attention in recent years. When applying quantum mechanics to intelligent algorithms, the first noteworthy problem is the representation of solutions in the form of a probability superposition. In the recently proposed multi-scale quantum harmonic oscillator algorithm (MQHOA), the representation of the solutions is not a superposition of the probability distributions, but a single distribution. This incorrect representation of the superposition state reduces the diversity of the solutions and limits the performance of the algorithm. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, a multiple-population-based mechanism that uses a quantum superposition is presented for MQHOA, which increases the search capacity of the algorithm by enhancing the diversity of the solutions. With the proposed method, the eigenstate is represented by the different size and distribution subpopulations of the particles. The optimization process is the process of continually changing the size and the distribution of the subpopulations to make the superposition state collapse to the ground state. The multiple-population based superposition state greatly increases the diversity of the optimization system and enhances the movement efficiency of the particles. The effectiveness of the method based on the performance of the algorithm was thoroughly investigated by comparing the method with the original MQHOA and several well-known intelligent algorithms on unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions and on a real-world charge management problem for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the multiple-population-based superposition state used by the proposed method. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is overexpressed and hyperactivated in a variety of human tumours, including breast cancer, thus representing a promising target for breast cancer treatment. In the present study, we evaluated the activities of a novel Stat3 inhibitor named Statmp-151 in the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and the murine mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1. The in vitro results showed that Statmp-151 inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner and suppressed the phosphorylation of Stat3 in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry (FCM) assays revealed that Statmp-151 affected mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, Statmp-151 inhibited cell migration, as shown by analysis of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9. Finally, in a 4T1 tumour-bearing mouse model, intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg/day Statmp-151 significantly suppressed the growth of tumours without obvious toxicity. These results indicated that Statmp-151 might be a potential candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which causes a highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals, is notable for epithelial cell tropism, resulting in the appearance of vesicles on the feet and in and around the mouth in infected animals, while FMDV infection in neonatal animals is also associated with not only epithelial lesions, but also muscle-associated lesions, which leads to myocarditis, resulting in high-mortality. However, critical knowledge about the non-epithelial tropism of FMDV is still lacking. In this paper, the current progress of the FMDV non-epithelial tropisms is summarized and the possible role of the key viral and cellular components involved is discussed.

AB To investigate the viral communities in diarrhoeal faeces of Tibetan pigs, 146 diarrhoeic samples were collected from 16 pigs farms on the Tibetan plateau. Nineteen viruses belonging to eleven viral taxonomic families were identified in a pooled library. Metagenomics analysis revealed that the viruses were mainly small linear and circular DNA viruses. Furthermore, sequences of 10 NS1 genes and two complete genomes of PBuVs were obtained by PCR amplification. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that the PBuVs from Tibetan pigs displayed more abundant genetic diversity than those from domestic pigs. This is the first description of the faecal viral community in Tibetan pigs associated with diarrhoea.

AB In this study, lead-free 0.6(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-0.4(Sr0.7-xCaxBi0.2)TiO3 ceramics (abbreviated as 6BNT-4SC(x)BT, x= 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 mol) were prepared by a traditional solid-state method. The effects of Ca2+ on phase structure, state transformation, ferroelectric and energy storage properties, and electrostrictive performance of 6BNT-4SCBT-x ceramics were comprehensively investigated. Co-occupied Bi3+, Na+, Sr2+ and Ca2+ ions induced the inhomogeneous distribution of A-site ions and charge, which resulted in polar nano-regions (PNRs) for relaxor ferroelectrics. 6BNT-4SC(x)BT ceramics present the ergodic relaxor state of polar rhombohedral PNR5 and weakly polar tetragonal PNR5 at room temperature. When the Ca2+ content was increased, 6BNT-4SC(0.01)BT ceramics showed the properties of weakly polar tetragonal PNR5 (with lowest T-p similar to 71 degrees C). 6BNT-4SC(x)BT ceramics exhibit electrostrictive effect Q(33) (similar to 0.045 m(4)/C-2) and high energy storage efficiency. Moreover, large Q(33) ( > 0.0421 m(4)/C-2) indicates good electrical field stability. This result is a significant advancement in the area of lead-free electrostrictive materials, which has a great prospect in BNT-based ceramics.

AB Lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) are virulence determinants ofGlaesserella parasuis, a pathogen of the respiratory tract of pigs. We previously reported that disruption of thegalUorgalEgene inG. parasuisresults in increased sensitivity to porcine serum, indicating that the galactose catabolism pathway is required for polysaccharide formation inG. parasuis. Here, we evaluated the role of theHAPS_0849gene in LOS synthesis. TheG. parasuisSC096HAPS_0849mutant produced a highly truncated LOS molecule, although a small fraction of intact LOS was still observed, and this mutant was found to be more sensitive to serum than the parental strain. HAPS_0849 was overexpressed and purified for biochemical assays, and this protein exhibited phosphoglucomutase (PGM) activity. Heterologous expression of apgmgene fromEscherichia coliin theHAPS_0849mutant led to restoration of the wild-type LOS glycoform, further demonstrating the PGM function of HAPS_0849 inG. parasuis. The autoagglutination and biofilm formation ability of this strain were also investigated. Disruption ofHAPS_0849led to an increased tendency to autoagglutinate and form more biofilms, and these enhanced phenotypes were observed in the absence of glucose. In addition, LOSs fromHAPS_0849,galUandlgtBmutants had similar truncated glycoforms, while LOSs from thegalEandlex-1mutants exhibited another type of defective LOS pattern. These findings imply that HAPS_0849 may function upstream of GalU in the generation of glucose 1-phosphate. In conclusion, our results preliminarily described the functions ofHAPS_0849inG. parasuis, and this gene was partially required for LOS synthesis.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potent regulators of gene expression and are widely expressed in biological systems. In reproduction, they have been shown to have a significant role in the acquisition and maintenance of male fertility, whereby deletion of Dicer in mouse germ cells leads to infertility. Evidence indicates that this role of miRNAs extends from the testis into the epididymis, controlling gene expression and contributing to regional variations in gene expression. In this study, RNA sequencing technology was used to investigate miRNA expression patterns in the yak epididymis. Region-specific miRNA expression was found in the yak epididymis. In all, 683 differentially expressed known miRNAs were obtained; 190, 186 and 307 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified for caput versus corpus, corpus versus cauda and caput versus cauda region pairs respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results showed endocytosis as the most enriched pathway across region pairs, followed by protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, spliceosome and biosynthesis of amino acids in region pair-specific hierarchical order. Gene ontology results showed varied enrichment in terms including cell, biogenesis, localisation, binding and locomotion across region pairs. In addition, significantly higher miR-34c expression was seen in the yak caput epididymidis relative to the corpus and cauda epididymidis.

The structural analysis reveals that each Cu+ in all complexes adopts an almost ideal trigonal planar geometry, with three coordinate NP2, and the C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are observed in the packing structures. DFT studied indicate the ingredients of the HOMOs and LUMOs for neutral copper (I) complexes 1b, 2b and 3b are different from cationic copper (I) complexes 1a, 2a and 3a, in accordance with the distribution of Mulliken atomic charges. Meanwhile, neutral copper (I) complexes 1b, 2b and 3b have fascinating broad blue-green emission bands at room temperature, while cationic copper (I) complexes 1a, 2a and 3a exhibit the existence of multiple emission peaks. Furthermore, the maximum phosphorescent lifetime and quantum yield at room temperature, for all copper (I) complexes, are 1143 mu s and 8.82%, respectively. In addition, in order to measure the practical application of these complexes, the selection of complex 1b is used to fabricate the LED, which emits a bright warm-white light.
   Structural characterization, DFT studied, luminescent properties of cationic/neutral three-coordinated copper (I) complexes and its application in light-emitting diodes have been studied. At room temperature, the maximum phosphorescent lifetime and quantum yield are up to 1143 mu s and 8.82%, respectively.

AB In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a direct re-modulation scheme for an IM/DD OFDM-WDM-PON. By adjusting the modulation index of the downstream OFDM data via its peak-to-peak laser driving voltage (Vpp), the proposed scheme directly modulates the upstream OFDM data onto the received wavelength at the optical network unit without employing any downstream data erasing technique or using any reflective semiconductor optical amplifier. Thanks to the reduced modulation index of the downstream data, the upstream data can be detected at the optical line terminal by simply regarding the residual downstream signal in the uplink as noise. And a 10-Gb/s symmetrical bi-directional transmission with the BER performance below 3.8x10(-3) is experimentally demonstrated.

AB Ethnophatmacological relevance: Persicaria orientalis (L.) Spach (internationally accepted and only valid name; synonym: Polygonum orientale L.; family: Polygonaceae), which is named Hongcao in China, is a Chinese herbal medicine that has a wide range of pharmacological effects including treatment to rheumatoid arthritis, coronary heart disease, hernia, carbuncle sore, enhance immunity, antimicrobial, osteogenic and dilated bronchiectasis.
   Aim of this review: This review aims to provide systematically organized information on traditional uses of Persicaria orientalis (L) Spach (P. orientalis) and to critically analyze evidences in phytotherapeutic, botanical, and pharmacological literatures that support its therapeutic potential in treatment to human diseases. Isolation of additional compounds and detailed pharmacological investigations are key areas to investigate.
   Materials and methods: Relevant information on P. orientalis was collected through published scientific materials (including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, ACS, CNKI, Scifinder, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar) and other literature sources (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2015 edition, Chinese herbal classic books and PhD and MSc thesis, etc.).
   Results: Traditional uses were compiled in this review, including classic prescriptions and historical applications. Approximately 70 compounds, mainly including flavonoids, phenolics, lignans, limonoids and steroids, have been isolated and identified from P. orientalis. Among them, flavonoids were main components. Crude extracts and pure compounds isolated from P. orientalis exhibited various pharmacological activities, such as protection against ischemia and hypoxia-induced myocardial cells and hypoxia/reoxygenation cardiomyocyte, increase the blood flow in myocardium, expanding bronchus, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, and antithrombotic effects and so on.
   Conclusions: P. orientalis is a valuable source with therapeutic potential on a wide range of diseases especially cardiovascular-system disorders. Though most traditional uses of P. orientalis are supported by in vitro/vivo pharmacological studies, however, there is still a lack of researches on active pharmacodynamic ingredients as well as in-depth and in-vivo mechanistic studies. Therefore, isolation and identification of more active compounds (especially flavonoids), their structure-activity relationship and studies on pharmacodynamic mechanisms by more elaborative in-vivo studies on P. orientalis may be focused on in order to confirm efficacy of reported therapeutic effects of P. orientalis and help explore it's therapeutic potentials. Furthermore, research designs of pharmacological studies based on traditional uses of anti-rheumatoid arthritis through cell lines and animal models should also be considered as key research topics.

AB Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) is thought to be a key regulator in lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, adipogenic differentiation, gene expression, and inflammatory response. However, it is not clear whether RXR alpha has any role in intramuscular preadipocyte of goat. In the current investigation, we report that adenovirus overexpression of RXR alpha promotes lipid accumulation in intramuscular adipocyte and up-regulates the expression of positive indicator genes (PPAR gamma and GLUT4). Next, knockdown of RXR alpha does not affect adipogenesis of intramuscular adipocyte. This phenomenon may be caused by the compensatory increase of RXR gamma. In addition, we found that KLF8 mediates the positive role of RXR alpha. Knockdown of KLF8 by siRNA attenuated the effect of RXR alpha on adipocyte differentiation. Importantly, the promoter activity of KLF8 is enhanced when overexpression of RXR alpha. Taken together, our data suggest that RXR alpha promotes the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes in goat through targeting KLF8, but it could be replaced by RXR gamma. These results provide new insights into the quality improvement of goat meat.

AB Aloe-emodin, which is isolated from Rheum palmatum L. and Aloe vera, has been proved to possess good antiproliferative activity. A series of Aloe-emodin derivatives were designed and synthesized; in addition, they were evaluated as inhibitors of proliferation of human breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231), human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (A549), and human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells. The biological activity results showed that 4a, 4c, and 4d exhibited better antiproliferative activity than aloe-emodin for MDA-MB-231 cells at a concentration of 3 mu M, and only 4a and 4d exhibited better antiproliferative activity for A549 cells at the same concentration level.

AB Previous meta-analytic studies have revealed that set-shifting ability contributes to achievement in math and reading equally during childhood, but less is known about whether set-shifting ability plays an equally important role in achievement in different school subjects during high-school learning. To fill this research gap, the current study examined the association between set-shifting ability and academic achievement among 10th-grade Chinese adolescents who attended high school (N = 221). Meanwhile, we further explored the possible mechanisms underlying this association by testing the mediating role of math abilities (i.e., arithmetic and algebraic ability). Set-shifting ability was measured through a task-switching task in which participants continuously change task rules based on color and shape sets. Academic achievement was indexed by curriculum-based examination scores. Based on exploratory factor analyses, the achievement scores could be classified into two categories: (a) science and math achievement, including math, physics, chemistry, biology, and geography scores; and (b) humanities achievement, comprising Chinese, English, history, and politics scores. Arithmetic ability and algebraic ability were measured by participants' ability to perform calculations and solve algebraic equations, respectively. Correlation and regression analyses found that set-shifting ability was related to science and math achievement, but not to humanities achievement. Furthermore, the association between set-shifting ability and science and math achievement is partly mediated by algebraic ability. Together, these results suggest that set-shifting ability plays a domain-specific role in achievement. That is, set-shifting ability is specifically linked to science and math achievement in Chinese adolescents, and this specific link may be partly mediated by algebraic ability.

AB We developed Cold Isostatic Joining (CIJ) which is an environmental friendly room temperature joining method. This technique extends cold sintering process to joining of glasses. By optimizing the CIJ conditions a shear stress (18 MPa) comparable to bulk fused silica was achieved. The technique surpasses other joining methods (e.g. adhesive bonding and brazing), because it is insensitive to thermal degradation. Unlike pressure-less silicate bonding, pressure assisted CIJ resulted in a thin joining interlayer (approximate to 27 nm) which maintained its integrity after being heated up to 1000 degrees C. The in-line transmittance (92%) was identical to un-joined material over the full spectrum making the joining nearly undetectable. The mechanism of CIJ formation and joining were clarified using X-ray diffraction (XRD and pole figure), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in line transmittance measurements. The cold joining method could find applications in the field of optics and semiconductors for wafer and lens bonding.

AB This letter studies a wireless powered sensor network (WPSN) where the senor nodes harvest energy from the power beacons by wireless power transfer (WPT). In order to improve the energy transfer efficiency of WPT, a WPT scheme with energy beamforming is presented to power the sensor network. Moreover, for the sake of maximizing energy efficiency (EE), we present a resource assignment optimization problem for this scheme, which is nonconvex because of the fractional form of the objective function. So we develop a low complexity algorithm to resolve this problem. Compared to other traditional algorithms (e.g., Dinkelbach [1]) for solving this type of problem, whose objective function is of fractional form, it works with lower time complexity. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme.

AB Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm (MQHOA) is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm proposed recently. It has been proved effective and efficient to deal with unimodal and multimodal problems. Although the mechanism of replacing the worst particle with the fittest individual in MQHOA helps to fasten the iteration process, it can easily lead to premature convergence. Instead of direct replacement, several migration strategies are proposed to maintain the diversity of the population and help to obtain the global optima in difficult function evaluations. The impacts of the migration strategies and individual stabilization on the improvement of the algorithms in their effectiveness, reliability, accuracy and efficiency are well researched. A variety of multi-dimensional unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions are applied to illustrate the optimization performance of the proposed algorithms. Some of the best competitors in MQHOAs with migration strategies are selected to compare with several state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms. Experimental results presented suggest some conclusions: First, the individual stabilization mechanism does not significantly improve the performance of MQHOA. Second, random migration does not obviously help MQHOA perform much better. Third, migration strategies significantly affect the performance of MQHOA, and some of MQHOAs with migration strategies are very competitive to deal with numerical optimization problems.

TI Influence of alfalfa seed belts on yield component and seed yield in
   mainland China - A review
SO LEGUME RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
DE Alfalfa seed; Cultivation measures; Production area; Yield
AB Alfalfa is widely cultivated and the seed yield differs in different regions due to the climate environment and so on in China. In order to obtain higher yield, alfalfa seed production must choose the most suitable area. Therefore, according to the geographical and climatic conditions, the alfalfa seed production area can be divided into four belts: Hexi Corridor belt, Hetao Plainbelt, the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains belt and the Hotanbelt in mainland China. Under different cultivation measures, the seed yield of four alfalfa seed production zones, varied in the range of 360-1833 kg/hm(2), 234.96-1560. 1kg/hm(2), 179.10-1197.33 kg/hm(2), 225-300 kg/hm(2), respectively. These different cultivation measures can provide theoretical guidance for alfalfa seed production in different production zones.

AB Outer membrane protein P2 (OmpP2) of the virulent Haemophilus (Glaesserella) parasuis has been shown to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The OmpP2 protein is composed of eight or nine surface-exposed loops, but it is unclear which of them participates in the OmpP2-induced inflammatory response. In this study, we synthesized linear peptides corresponding to surface-exposed loops L1-L8 of OmpP2 from the virulent H. parasuis SC096 strain to stimulate porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro. We found that both L7 and L8 significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-23 and the chemokines CCL-4 and CCL-5 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we constructed ompP2 Delta Loop7 and ompP2 Delta Loop8 mutant SC096 strains and extracted their native OmpP2 proteins to stimulate PAMs. These mutant proteins induced significantly less mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines than SC096 OmpP2. Next, the amino acid sequences of L7 and L8 from 15 serovars of H. parasuis OmpP2 were aligned. These sequences were relatively conserved among the most virulent reference strains, suggesting that L7 and L8 are the most active peptides of the OmpP2 protein. Furthermore, L7 and L8 significantly upregulated the NF-kappa B and AP-1 activity levels based on luciferase reporter assays in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, our results demonstrated that both surface-exposed loops L7 and L8 of H. parasuis OmpP2 induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines possibly by activating the NF-kappa B and MAPK signalling pathways in cells infected by H. parasuis.

AB Neboviruses (NeVs) is an important causative agent of calf diarrhea. Here, 354 diarrhoeic samples were collected from yak on 55 farms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. 22.0% of the diarrhoeic samples were detected as NeVs-positive by RT-PCR assay. Phylogenetic analysis of 78 NeVs RdRp fragments showed that 69 strains were closely related to NB-like strains, and the remaining 9 strains were clustered into an independent branch, which may represent a novel RdRp genotype. Two complete NeVs genomes (YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH) were successfully sequenced with 7459 nt and 7460 nt in length, respectively. The genomes of the two strains only shared 68.1%-69.3% nt identity with all six known NeVs genomes, and phylogenetic trees based on its genome, VP1, RdRp, VP2, P34, NTPase, P30, VPg and 3CLpro proteins suggested that the two strains may represent a novel NeVs strain with novel VP1 genotype and novel RdRp genotype. Notably, 11.5% NeVs strains were screened as the novel NeVs strains based VP1 and RdRp sequences. These novel NeVs strains were detected from 6 farms in two counties, indicating that the novel NeVs has spread in local region. To best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of NeVs in yak. Moreover, a novel NeVs strain was identified based on complete genome. These results contribute to further understand the prevalence and genetic evolution of NeVs.

ID IMMUNE ALGORITHM
AB A task scheduling algorithm is an effective means to ensure multi-core processor system efficiency. This paper defines the task scheduling problem for multi-core processors and proposes a multi-objective constraint task scheduling algorithm based on artificial immune theory (MOCTS-AI). The MOCTS-AI uses vaccine extraction and vaccination to add prior knowledge to the problem and performs vaccine selection and population updating based on the Pareto optimum, thereby accelerating the convergence of the algorithm. In the MOCTS-AI, the crossover and mutation operators and the corresponding use probability for the task scheduling problem are designed to guarantee both the global and local search ability of the algorithm. Additionally, the antibody concentration in the the MOCTS-AI is designed based on the bivariate entropy. By designing the selection probability in consideration of the concentration probability and fitness probability, antibodies with high fitness and low concentration are selected, thereby optimizing the population and ensuring its diversity. A simulation experiment was performed to analyze the convergence of the algorithm and the solution diversity. Compared with other algorithms, the MOCTS-AI effectively optimizes the scheduling length, system energy consumption and system utilization.

ID EQUINE ARTERITIS VIRUS
AB Duck hepatitis A virus type 3 (DHAV-3) infection is characterized by severe hepatitis. In recent years, DHAV-3 has become widespread in Asia and has led to economic losses. Conventional methods for DHAV-3 detection usually depend on the use of larger equipment that is not portable and is not fit for on-site diagnoses. In this study, a rapid reverse transcription insulated isothermal (RT-iiPCR) technique was developed for the on-site detection of DHAV-3 based on the POCKIT (TM) system in a convenient device. The concentration of primer pairs and probes were optimized for amplification of the DHAV-3 VP3 gene of DHAV-3, with no amplification of 12 other duck pathogens. The detection limit of viral RNA was 3.85 x 10(1) copies/mu L, and the analytical sensitivity and specificity levels were both 100% in the detection of 40 liver samples. Furthermore, 97.5% of the RT-iiPCR results were in agreement with those of rRT-PCR, with a kappa value of 0.93. This method is time-saving and better suited to field diagnoses because of its portable device.

AB We fully investigate the skin toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in cancer patients. The studies about randomized controlled trials in cancer treatment with EGFR-TKIs were retrieved and the systematic evaluation was conducted. The results suggest that EGFR-TKIs significantly increase the risk of skin toxicities including all-grade rash, pruritus, dry skin, and high-grade rash, pruritus. However, the risk of high-grade dry skin did not increase. Rash was the most common toxicity. Physicians should be aware of skin toxicities and should monitor cancer patients when receiving EGFR-TKIs.

AB The denoising and detection of transient disturbances are two important subjects for power quality monitoring and analysis. To effectively denoise and detect transient disturbances under noisy conditions, an improved iterative adaptive kernel regression method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method has advantages in that it does not need to estimate the noise variance or a filter threshold, and has both denoising and detection capabilities for transient disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides excellent denoising effects, which can not only suppress noise effectively but also preserve disturbance features of sudden change points well. Additionally, it provides good detection and location performance for single and combined transient disturbances, even under strong noise conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is further verified by using real disturbance data.

AB Rh gets close attention recently since it might improve C1 pathway efficiency toward ethanol oxidation reaction. Considering COad species are the vital intermediates for the C1 pathway, thus we fundamentally investigate the CO adsorption and oxidation on Rh surface. The results show that the formation of COad layer on Rh is more sluggish in alkaline media, may be due to the high OH- concentration induced bigger electronegativity of Rh electrode. This local environment change also leads to the onset potential of COML oxidation in 0.1 M NaOH negatively shift about 200 mV (at ca. 0.43 V) with respect to that in 0.1 M H2SO4. The oxidation of COML on Rh in alkaline media might be divided into two potential sections. One may follow the Eley-Rideal mechanism at 0.45-0.55 V with OH- ions directly attracting the surface weakly adsorbed COL species; the other is the oxidation of COML species through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This work may provide some fundamental supporting for fabricating highly efficient ethanol oxidation catalysts.

AB Two Bacillus atrophaeus strains, the first being a highly stress-resistant ATCC 9372 strain and the Ua strain identified from a chromium mine by our lab, differ in their abilities to tolerate and remove Uranium (VI) from contaminated water. An increase in U(VI) concentration in growth media led to a decrease in the tolerance and bio-remedial capacity of both strains. However, under high concentrations of U(VI) in the growth media, the ATCC 9372 strain demonstrated a higher tolerance and a higher removal capacity than the Ua strain. Two approaches, transcriptome sequencing and transgenic technology, were used to elucidate the relationship between particular genes within these two strains and their U(VI) removal capacity. Sequencing confirmed the expression of two genes unique to the Ua strain, previously designated ytiB and ythA. They encode putative proteins that show the highest levels of identity to carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome bd terminal oxidase I, respectively. Using the pBE-S DNA vector, ytiB and ythA were transformed into the ATCC 9372 strain of Bacillus atrophaeus. Under a U(VI) concentration of 120 mg/L, the removal rates of the transgenic ATCC 9372-ytiB and ATCC 9372-ythA strains decreased by 7.55% and 7.43%, respectively, compared to the removal rate of the control strain transformed with empty plasmid. The results suggest that both ythA and ytiB genes have a negative influence on the uranium removing capacity of Bacillus atrophaeus. This finding will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of uranium removal by bacteria.

AB Passive solar technologies are traditionally considered as cost-effective ways for the building heating. However, conventional passive solar buildings are insufficient to create a relatively stable and comfortable indoor thermal environment. To further increase the indoor air temperature and reduce the heating energy consumption, a hybrid heat collecting facade (HHCF) is proposed in this paper. To analyze the thermal performance of the HHCF, a heat transfer model based on the heat balance method is established and validated by experimental results. Meanwhile, the energy saving potential of a room with the HHCF is evaluated as well. When the HHCF is applied to places where heating is required in the cold season while refrigeration is unnecessary in hot season, the HHCF can reduce the heating need by 40.2% and 21.5% compared with the conventional direct solar heat gain window and the Trombe wall, respectively. Furthermore, a series of parametric analyses are performed to investigate the thermal performance of the room with HHCF under various design and operating conditions. It is found that the thermal performance of the HHCF mainly depends on the window operational schedule, the width and the absorptivity of heat collecting wall, and the thermal performance of the inner double-glass window. The modeling and the parametric study in this paper are beneficial to the design and the optimization of the HHCF in passive solar buildings.

AB This article for the first time reveals the impact of the damping property of materials on its sand-fixing durability. Based on the turbulence of wind, it could be regarded as a kind of periodic mechanical force. So, when polymers are used to fix sand, they would constantly perceive a periodic force of wind. And, this force would give rise to yielding fracture and fatigue of polymer, so that the sand-fixing durability of material could be weakened significantly. To impair the periodic force of wind and extend the durability of sand-fixation polymer materials, we, for the first time, introduce the designing principle of macromolecular damping material, that can transform external mechanical force into own thermal energy, into the preparation of sand-fixing materials. In this work, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) emulsions with different dangling chain have been synthesized successfully in order to improve their damping properties. The effects of the prepared PVAc with gradually growing dangling chain length have been investigated on their damping properties, on the sand stabilization strengths and sand-fixing durability. And the relationship between the damping property and the sand-fixing property of PVAc was built by simulating wind tunnel test. The experimental results show that, introducing the dangling chain could significantly improve the damping temperature range and extend the anti-wind erosion time of PVAc. It has to be noticed that, introducing the dangling chain, will provide a double effects for the sand stabilization strength of materials, i.e., it can improve both the flexibility of the side-chain and the internal friction of the molecular chains. Wind tunnel test verified that introducing the dangling chain can raise the damping performance of material and convert more periodic force of wind into the friction heat of molecular chain, and thus impair the damage of wind on the materials and improve their anti-wind erosion properties. These findings suggest that the damping material applied in sand fixation is a bright idea and successful method for improving the sand-fixing durability. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

AB An efficient cascade aza-Michael-Michael sequence for the preparation of tetrahydroquinolines has been established. Three contiguous stereogenic centers are created with high levels of enantioselectivities (79-99% ee) and exclusive diastereoselectivities in the presence of a bifunctional squaramide. This approach is compatible with a broad range of beta,gamma-unsaturated alpha-ketoesters and 2-aminochalcones. Our protocol indicated that beta-site of beta,gamma-unsaturated alpha-ketoester is an available pro-nucleophilic site. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nebovirus is a new genus within the family Caliciviridae and is a causative agent of calf diarrhea. The limited nebovirus genomic sequences that are currently available has hampered understanding of nebovirus genetic evolution. The aim of the present study was to determine the genomic characterization of strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH, which was previously identified as being similar to the novel genotype strain Bo/DijonA216/06/FR based on partial capsid sequences. Our results show that the complete RNA genome of strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH is 7453 nucleotides (nt) in length and shares 79.0%-83.5% nt identity with all available nebovirus genomes in the GenBank database. A phylogenetic analysis based on its complete genome sequence revealed that strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH clustered into an independent branch. Two interesting characteristics were observed in the genome of strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH. First, the major capsid protein (VP1) of strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH shares 96.6% amino acid (aa) identity with strain Bo/DijonA216/06/FR but shares only 75.2%-76.8% aa identity with other nebovirus strains and has an even lower identity in the P2 domain (61.1%-65% aa identity). Second, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH is more closely related to NB-like strains than it is to strain Bo/DijonA216/06/FR, and a recombination event was identified within the 3' end of the RdRp in strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH. In conclusion, the results in this study indicate that strain Bo/LZB-1/17/CH may represent a novel nebovirus strain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a recombinant event in nebovirus RdRp.

AB Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is one of the most serious parasitic zoonosis in Asia. Shiqu County is the most important endemic area of AE in China. Our primary objective is to find out the risk factors for Echinococcus multilocularis infection in domestic dogs in Shiqu County during the summer herding period. A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from 60 ranchers in October 2016. Nested PCR (nPCR) was performed to amplify regions of the mitochondrial12S rRNA gene of E. multilocularis. The results showed that the infection rates of AE in dogs from Qiwu, Yiniu, Changshaganma, Derongma, Mengyi, and Xiazha villages were 5, 5, 10, 20, 10, and 5%, respectively. It should be stressed that the infected dogs will shed eggs through feces and may have a habit of preying on rodents, the intermediate host of the parasite, and become re-infected. This investigation confirmed the presence of E. multilocularis infection in dogs in Shiqu and revealed the risk factors associated with the infection during summer herding.

AB Contents The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism that regulates pre-implantation development of the yak (Bos grunniens). We determined the transcriptomes of in vitro-produced yak embryos at two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell stages, and morula and blastocyst using the Illumina RNA-seq for the first time. We obtained 47.36-50.86million clean reads for each stage, of which, 85.65%-90.02% reads were covered in the reference genome. A total of 17,368 genes were expressed during the two-cell stage to blastocyst of the yak, of which 7,236 genes were co-expressed at all stages, whereas 10,132 genes were stage-specific expression. Transcripts from 9,827 to 14,893 different genes were detected in various developmental stages. When |log(2) ratio|1 and q-value <0.05 were set as thresholds for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we detected a total of 6,922-10,555 DEGs between any two consecutive stages. The GO distributions of these DEGs were classified into three categories: biological processes (23 terms), cellular components (22 terms) and molecular functions (22 terms). Pathway analysis revealed 310 pathways of the DEGs that were operative in early pre-implantation yak development, of which 32 were the significantly enriched pathways. In conclusion, this is the first report to investigate the mechanism that regulates yak embryonic development using high-throughput sequencing, which provides a comprehensive framework of transcriptome landscapes of yak pre-implantation embryos.

AB High-velocity shock loading was applied over an elemental Nb and Si granular mixture (atomic ratio of 5:3) using the flyer plate technique to produce niobium silicide compounds, with flyer velocities of up to 2.23 km/s and 2.63 km/s employed in two separate treatments. Although it was ascertained that both velocities were sufficient to initiate a chemical reaction between the reactant mixtures, the extent of the shock-induced chemical reaction varied with the impact velocity. Whereas the lower impact velocity (2.23 km/s) led to a partial chemical reaction and localized products of NbSi2, Nb3Si, as well as unreacted Nb and Si, the higher impact velocity (2.63 km/s) brought about a complete shock-induced chemical reaction producing single-phase Nb5Si3 bulk product that matched the atomic ratio of Nb/Si in the mixture.

AB Water pollution has caused much attention nowadays. Photocatalysis as a kind of advanced oxidation technology has been widely studied in the field of environmental pollution control. As a stable nonmetal photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 assisted by H2O2 was investigated for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. The combination of g-C3N4 and H2O2 has much higher activity than that of pure g-C3N4 or H2O2. Neutral solution is preferred for the high phtotocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 with H2O2. The effect of the amount of catalyst, H2O2 concentration and RhB concentration was investigated. Photocatalytic mechanism study using radical scavenger showed free radicals O-2(-) and center dot OH are the main active species. g-C3N4 assisted by H2O2 showed good photostability and repeatability after five cycles of degradation experiment.

AB The mid-infrared (mid-IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) capabilities of Mg-IV-V-2 (IV = Si, Ge, Sn; V = P, As) are systematically assessed by the first-principles calculation. The results show that the compounds in this group except MgSiP2 and MgSnP2 have moderate birefringence values to fulfill the phase-matching conditions. In particular, MgGeP2 and MgSiAs2 possess relatively large band gaps and almost three to four times larger static SHG coefficients than the benchmark material AgGaSe2, exhibiting good potential for mid-IR NLO application. According to the detailed analysis of the electronic structures, it is found that the dominant SHG contributions are from the orbitals of the asymmetry anionic unit [IV-V-2](2-). Moreover, the further evaluation reveals that MgSiAs2, MgGeAs2, MgSnP2 and MgSnAs2 are not thermodynamically stable and the new synthesis strategy (i.e. synthesis under non-equilibrium conditions) should be considered.

AB Introduction: Anticancer enzymes play important roles in cancer treatment. The anticancer enzyme has been in clinical use to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia for many years. Other types of anticancer enzymes have been investigated in laboratory studies and clinical trials.
   Area covered: This paper will provide perspectives on the indications, anticancer mechanisms, enzymatic characteristics (such as molecular weight, organism source, and kinetic parameters) and pharmacokinetic behaviors of anticancer enzymes and their delivery systems by systematically analyzing available literature. The pharmacodynamics of anticancer enzyme delivery systems has also been summarized.
   Expert opinion: Anticancer enzymes kill cancer cells by depleting important nutrients required for growth or producing metabolite toxic to tumor cells. Suitable enzyme delivery systems have demonstrated promising effects on the pharmacokinetics, bioactivity and application of anticancer enzymes. Their current limitations and future potential are analyzed.

ID FUSION
AB Automatic finger vein recognition systems have attracted more attentions in recent years. In order to implement a high performance system, an important step is to localize the region of interest accurately. A problem in previous ROI localization methods is that some useful finger vein information is lost in the final cropped ROI region. In order to resolve this problem, a novel ROI extraction method for finger vein images is proposed in this paper. Finger edges are detected and adjusted to the horizontal direction, after that a modified sliding window is used in order to detect the distal inter-joint line of the finger. On the basis of the edges and the distal inter-phalangeal joint line of the finger, different from previous methods, an outer rectangle is used to crop the finger area to avoid the useful information loss. Based on our experimental dataset with 3132 finger vein images, the mean information loss rate for previous methods is 15.1% and there is no loss of information for our method. In order to evaluate the accuracy of our ROI extraction method, the similarity rate of intra-class is calculated, which is defined by the ratio of overlap area and the whole ROI area. And a mean similarity rate 96.3% is obtained in our experiments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and accurate, and it is potentially beneficial for improving the performance of finger vein recognition system.

TI Remote Three-Factor Authentication Protocol with Strong Robustness for
   Multi-Server Environment
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME; SMART-CARD; EFFICIENT; SECURITY
AB If a user wants to acquire different network services from various application servers in a traditional single server environment, the user must register these servers separately and remember different usernames and passwords for different servers. To solve these problems, a lot of authentication schemes for multi-server environment have been proposed. Recently, Odelu and Das et al. proposed a secure multi-server authentication protocol based on smart card, biometric and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). We firstly analyze Odelu et al.'s scheme and find some flaws as follows: 1) the scheme may suffer Denial of Service (Dos) attack and insider attack; 2) The scheme doesn't have strong robustness because improper work of the register center (RC) may lead to the collapse of the whole system; 3) There are some design flaws in this scheme. For example, the user cannot choose his/her identity randomly and the register center needs to maintain a data table. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a new secure three-factor authentication protocol for multi-server environment based on Chebyshev chaotic map and secure sketch algorithm. To verify the security of the proposed scheme, we simulate our scheme using BAN logic and ProVerif tool. Through a thorough analysis, we can see that the proposed scheme not only has stronger security but also has less computation cost than Odelu et al.'s protocol.

The phase structure, microstructure, and electrical properties of KNN-xBLNKZ ceramics have been investigated. Both large piezoelectric coefficient (d (33) similar to 368 pC/N) and high Curie temperature (T (C) similar to 323 A degrees C) can be achieved for the composition of x = 0.050 with rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) multi ferroelectric phases coexistence near room temperature. In addition, a good thermal stability of piezoelectricity can also be observed in this composition (e.g., d (33) ae 308 pC/N, T (a) ae 300 A degrees C). Therefore, we believe that this material system is a promising lead-free piezoelectric candidate for the high-temperature piezoelectric applications.

AB The environmental catastrophic accidents in China over the last three decades have triggered implementation of myriad policies by the government to help abate environmental pollution in the country. Consequently, research into environmental pollution liability insurance and how that can stimulate economic growth and the development of financial market in China is worthwhile. This study attempts to design a financial derivative for China's environmental pollution liability insurance to offer strong financial support for significant compensation towards potential catastrophic environmental loss exposures, especially losses from the chemical industry. Assuming the risk-free interest rate is 4%, the market portfolio expected return is 12%; the financial asset beta coefficient is 0.5, by using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and cash flow analysis; the principal risk bond yields 9.4%, single-period and two-period prices are 103.85 and 111.58, respectively; the principal partial-risk bond yields 10.09%, single-period and two-period prices are 103.85 and 111.58, respectively; and the principal risk-free bond yields 8.94%, single-period and two-period prices are 107.99 and 115.83, respectively. This loss exposure transfer framework transfers the catastrophic risks of environmental pollution from the traditional insurance and reinsurance markets to the capital market. This strengthens the underwriting capacity of environmental pollution liability insurance companies, mitigates the compensation risks of insurers and reinsurers, and provides a new channel to transfer the risks of environmental pollution.

AB Climate change is likely to alter the relative abundances of plant functional groups and the interactions between plants and soil microbes that maintain alpine meadow ecosystems. However, little is known about how warming-induced alterations to aboveground biomass (AGB) affect soil nutrients and microbial communities. We investigated plant community characteristics in 2002-2009 and analyzed soil properties and the soil microbial community in 2007-2009 to study the effects of warming in Qinghai Province, China. Sampling involved the use of warmed open top chambers, the monitoring of plant community characteristics, the quantification of total and available amounts of soil nutrients, and the evaluation of microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Experimental warming initially significantly increased the number of plant functional groups and plant community AGB; however, plant community diversity and species richness decreased. Nevertheless, all these variables stabilized over time. Fungal and bacterial abundance, total nitrogen, available nitrogen and soil organic matter increased with warming, while microbial PLFAs decreased. These findings demonstrated that climate change drivers and their interactions may cause changes in soil nutrients and the abundance and content of soil microbial PLFAs. Elevated temperature has strong effects on aboveground grass biomass. Surface conditions and disturbance affect the soil microbial communities of deep soil layers.

TI Bletilla striata Micron Particles Function as a Hemostatic Agent
   by Promoting Rapid Blood Aggregation
SO EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The human body cannot control blood loss without treatment. Available hemostatic agents are ineffective at treating cases of severe bleeding and are expensive or raise safety concerns. Bletilla striata serve as an inexpensive, natural, and promising alternative. However, no detailed studies on its hemostatic approach have been performed. The aim of this study was to examine the hemostatic effects of B. striata Micron Particles (BSMPs) and their hemostatic mechanisms. We prepared and characterized BSMPs of different size ranges and investigated their use as hemostatic agent. BSMPs of different size ranges were characterized by scanning electron microscope. In vitro coagulation studies revealed BSMP-blood aggregate formation via stereoscope and texture analyzers. In vivo studies based on rat injury model illustrated the BSMP capabilities under conditions of hemostasis. Compared to other BSMPs of different size ranges, BSMPs of 350-250 mu m are most efficient in hemostasis. As powder sizes decrease, the degree of aggregation between particles and hemostatic BSMP effects declines. The BSMP in contact with a bleeding surface locally forms a visible particle/blood aggregate as a physical barrier that facilitates hemostasis. Considering the facile preparation, low cost, and long shelf life of B. striata, BSMPs offer great potential as mechanisms of trauma treatment.

AB Analog sulfur-containing precursors (ASCPs) were employed to prepare activated carbon (AC) for supercapacitor by potassium hydroxide (KOH) chemical activation. The influence of sulfate, K2SO4, FeSO4, and CaSO4 on pore structure of resultant AC and its capacitance performance was investigated extensively. The results indicate that FeSO4 and K2SO4 in ASCPs can be involved deeply in activation reaction. K2SO4 can play a synergistic activation role in increasing porosity and capacitance performance, while FeSO4 can react with and consume a certain amount of KOH, thus decreasing the performance of AC. Compared with K2SO4 and FeSO4, CaSO4 in ASCPs has low reactivity; namely, only a small part of CaSO4 was involved in activation reaction, while most of it was transformed into CaCO3 residued in AC during washing process. Due to coexistence of CaCO3 with AC, the porosity and capacitance performance of AC were decreased obviously. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that in comparison with K+ and Ca2+, Fe2+ in ASCPs is more beneficial for transformation of inorganic sulfate into organic thioether in AC.

AB In this paper, the Lie symmetry analysis is performed on the KBK equation. By constructing its one-dimensional optimal system, we obtain four classes of reduced equations and corresponding group-invariant solutions. Particularly, the traveling wave equation, as an important reduced equation, is investigated in detail. Treating it as a singular perturbation system in R-3, we study the phase space geometry of its reduced system on a two-dimensional invariant manifold by using the dynamical system methods such as tracking the unstable manifold of the saddle, studying the equilibria at infinity and discussing the homoclinic bifurcation and Poincare bifurcation. Correspongding wavespeed conditions are determined to guarantee the existence of various bounded traveling waves of the KBK equation.

AB Understory management in forest ecosystems has been applied to improve the wood production for hundreds of years worldwide. The carbon-physiological mechanisms underlying these positive effects of understory management on the growth of overstory trees have received less attention. We studied the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) and total nitrogen (N) concentrations in tissues (needles, stem sapwood, and fine roots) of three tree species (two evergreen and one deciduous species) grown in the presence or absence (understory cut) of understory shrubs in plantations in southwestern China, to test whether understories affect the carbon and nitrogen status in the overstory trees. The concentrations of N, NSC (= soluble sugars + starch) in overstory trees varied significantly with understory treatments during the dry season rather than the wet season. Trees grown without understory shrubs had higher levels of N and NSC compared to trees grown with understories. The present study provides insight to explain the functional mechanisms for understory effects on growth of overstory trees, and indicates that the nitrogen and carbon status in overstory trees may be more strongly negatively affected by understory in stressful conditions rather than in optimal growth conditions. Moreover, the present study provides ecophysiology-based knowledge for dealing with understory vegetation management in forest ecosystems.

AB Carbon-cloth-based polyaniline flexible electrode materials were fabricated by a simple chemical oxidation method with the assistance of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) at different concentrations, where SDBS acts as a surfactant and dopant to control the morphology, structure and capacitance performance of the electrode material. TGA, BET, XRD, FT-IR, UV-vis and SEM analyses showed that a suitable amount of SDBS can enhance the interchain spacing of the polyaniline and the regularity of its main-chain structure as well as helping to vary its morphology (e.g., networks, spherical, or rod-like structures) on carbon cloth. More importantly, SDBS facilitated the bonding between polyaniline and carbon cloth, leading to the formation of good three-dimensional networks and spherical and rod-like structures, respectively. The insertion/de-insertion of electrolyte ions was easier due to the unique morphology and structure of materials prepared with SDBS, and the utilization ratio of polyaniline was also higher. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests revealed that of the three composites studied (PANI/CC-0,1,2, depending on the SDBS amount), PANI/CC-1 achieved the optimal capacitance performance, i.e., a high specific capacitance (up to 537 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1), which is 31.9% higher than that without SDBS), high capacity retention (83.4% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, compared to 46.9% for PANI/CC-0), and high energy density (74.5 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 0.25 kW kg(-1)) as well as the best rate capability and the lowest impedance. In summary, the addition of a suitable amount of SDBS has a positive effect on improving the capacitance performance of carbon-cloth-based polyaniline electrodes.

AB A simple, scalable sol-gel method was developed for preparing anatase TiO2 nanoparticles under mild conditions without the use of surfactants. The synthesized nanocrystals can be easily dispersed in acidic (pH < 4) or alkaline (pH > 8) aqueous solutions, and form a transparent hydrocolloid which remains stable for more than 1 year. However, the TiO2 nanoparticles could be precipitated from the stable hydrocolloid by adjusting the pH to 5-7, and the nanoparticles harvested by simple filtration. The synergistic effect of the steric hindrance of an ethoxy group on the nanoparticle surface and Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) theory force were used to explain the ease with which the nanoparticles redisperse in water, the high stability of the suspensions, and the reversible and controllable water dispersibility of TiO2 nanocrystals. Finally, the anatase nanoparticles were used as a recyclable photocatalyst to degrade Rhodamine B (Rh B) under 175 W High-Pressure Mercury Lamp illumination. Freshly prepared TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited a high photodegradation efficiency of 99% and the nanocatalyst retained its 99% efficiency even after 10 degradation cycles.

AB A growing number of studies suggest that epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in early-weaned animals. The objective of this experiment was to compare the biological activity of intracellularly expressed EGF (IE-EGF), extracellularly expressed EGF (EE-EGF), and tagged EGF (T-EGF) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) both in vivo and in vitro. Strains of S. cerevisiae expressing IE-EGF, EE-EGF, and T-EGF were designated INVSc1-IE(+), INVSc1-EE(+), and INVSc1-TE(-), respectively. The production performance, intestinal development, physio-biochemical indexes, and immunological function of early-weaned rats were measured in vivo to evaluate the biological activity of IE-EGF, EE-EGF, and T-EGF. In addition, the proliferation of rat enterocyte was also measured in vitro. In the in vivo experiment, the recombinant S. cerevisiae was shown to survive throughout the intestinal tract. The production performance (e.g., body weight) and intestinal development (e.g., mean villous height, crypt depth, total protein, DNA, and RNA) of the rats were significantly enhanced in the INVSc1-IE(+) group compared with the INVSc1-EE(+) and INVSc1-TE(-) groups (P < 0.05). However, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) showed no difference in the INVSc1-IE(+) group compared to the INVSc1-EE(+) and INVSc1-TE(-) groups (P > 0.05), with the only significant difference being found for creatine kinase (CK) (P < 0.05). In the in vitro experiment, the proliferation of enterocyte was significantly stimulated by both IE-EGF and EE-EGF compared with T-EGF (P < 0.05). Herein, IE-EGF is more suitable for application to early-weaned animals compared with EE-EGF and T-EGF.

AB Objective. This study investigated the prevalence and severity of neurological soft signs (NSS), and their relationships with borderline personality (BP) traits in adolescents. Methods. Eighty-nine adolescents with BP traits (BP-trait group), and 89 adolescents without traits of any personality disorder (control group), were recruited in China. BP traits were diagnosed by the BPD subscale of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire for the DSM-IV (PDQ-4+). The soft sign subscales of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory were administered to all participants. The group differences in prevalence of soft signs and in NSS scores were analyzed, as well as the associations between the NSS scale and borderline personality traits. Results. Five soft signs were significantly more frequent in adolescents with BP traits. A total of 59.6% of adolescents with BP traits exhibited at least 1 NSS, whereas only 34.8% of adolescents without BP traits did (p < 0.01). A total of 42.7% of adolescents in the BP-trait group exhibited at least 2 NSS, while only 16.9% of adolescents without BP traits did (p < 0.001). Moreover, adolescents with BP traits showed more sensory integration, disinhibition, total neurological soft signs, left-side soft signs, and right-side soft signs, than adolescents without BP traits. Sensory integration and disinhibition were positively associated with BP traits. Conclusion. These findings suggest that adolescents with BP traits may have a nonfocal abnormality of the central nervous system.

AB The introduction of multiple carbon rings is one of the common ways for graphene modification. Starting from warped C80H30 nanographene, which consists of a number of six- and seven-membered carbon rings (C6 and C7) centering at a five-membered carbon ring (C5), we explored the structure and property variations of its derivatives in which their C7 rings were gradually replaced with C6 rings. With reducing number of C7 rings, their curved boundary with the C6 rings becomes flat until a bowl-like structure is formed when all the C7 rings disappear. The optical absorption spectra vary accordingly. Both the a-bands and the maximum absorption bands in the visible region are related to the number and location of the C7 rings. Further analysis of the excited states of the C80H30 derivatives, as well as on the designed model systems, revealed that the C7 rings affect the electron excitations in two ways. In addition to their participation in electronic transitions, they control the composition of molecular orbitals that are involved in the excitations. The highest occupied molecular orbitals are mainly contributed by atoms on the C6 and C7 rings, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals by atoms on the C5 and C6 rings. Our study sheds some light on how the multiple carbon rings affect the optical absorption of nanographenes and provides information for the preparation of nanographenes with tunable structural and optical properties.

AB Solar-driven interfacial evaporation and thermoelectric cogeneration technologies, with their sustainability and high efficiency, offer innovative solutions to address freshwater and energy shortages. Graphene oxide (GO) membranes are favorable for solar energy absorption, but the non-full-spectrum absorption ability limits their energy efficiency. Herein, a high photothermal conversion composite membrane is employed via an environmentally friendly static deposition method, which consists of Zn2+ crosslinked carbonylated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs-COOH) intercalated into GO interlayer (GO-Zn-CNTx). By adjusting SWCNTs-COOH content, the light-trapping effect and interlayer micro-nano structure of GO-Zn-CNTx membranes are optimized, achieving synergistic improvement in light absorption and evaporation property. Under 1 solar irradiation, GO-Zn-CNT40 reaches an evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.77 kg m-2 h-1 and 92.47%. Moreover, the membrane demonstrates excellent cyclic stability. Even after 10 cycles, its evaporation rate remains above 1.50 kg m-2 h-1. In addition, through the combination of this membrane with a sustainable thermoelectric module, a thermoelectric co-generation system (TCS) is developed to obtain an output voltage of 120 mV under 1 solar light, enabling waste heat recovery. In outdoor tests, the system can produce 4.3 L m-2 d-1 freshwater with a maximum voltage reaching 57 mV. This study presents a TCS that achieves the cogeneration of fresh water and electricity, providing a potential solution for freshwater and power supply in remote areas, with promising applications in green and sustainable development.

AB Background The Zoige Plateau hosts the largest alpine peatland in the world, playing a crucial role in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. However, this valuable ecosystem has been significantly impacted by anthropogenic drainage for various purposes, prompting increased interests in ecological restoration efforts. This study evaluates changes in plant diversity, community composition, and biomass allocation across natural, drained, and rewetted peatlands, with a particular focus on variations in microtopography, including hollows and hummocks. Results Restoration showed significantly higher soil water content, which was 11.6% higher in hollows (to 88.5 +/- 0.09%) and 14.4% higher in hummocks (to 81.1 +/- 1.6%) of rewetted peatlands compared to natural peatlands (p < 0.001). However, the water table depth did not differ significantly from that of natural peatlands (p = 0.61). While peatland management did not significantly affect plant diversity, microtopography had a considerable impact on plant species richness, dominance, the Shannon-Wiener index, and evenness. Conversely, plant community composition exhibited significant differences among natural, drained, and rewetted peatlands at both hollow and hummock microsites. Aboveground biomass was significantly higher in drained and rewetted peatlands compared to natural peatlands at both microsites, whereas belowground biomass was significantly lower in drained and rewetted peatlands, particularly in hummocks. Conclusions Rewetting raises water table depth but does not fully restore the original plant community composition or biomass. Microtopography plays a vital role in influencing plant diversity and community composition, with hummocks showing greater resilience to drainage impacts. Our findings emphasize ecological consequences of peatland management practices and highlight the need for targeted restoration strategies to strengthen the resilience of these vital ecosystems.

AB Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, whose systemic treatment options are currently limited to chemotherapy. Carbon nanoparticles-Fe(II) complex (CNSI-Fe) is a promising antitumor drug that induces ferroptosis to kill tumor cells efficiently. In this study, we combined CNSIFe and a ferroptosis inducer sorafenib (SRF) to achieve the efficient chemotherapy of TNBC. CNSI-Fe could adsorb SRF by hydrophobic interaction and it-it stacking with a maximum adsorption capacity of 31 mg/g. During the in vitro assays, CNSI-Fe+SRF combination inhibited the cell viability of 4T1 cells much more efficiently than CNSI-Fe or SRF alone. The high Fe uptake, hydroxyl radical generation and oxidative damages verified the ferroptosis of 4T1 cells upon the CNSI-Fe+SRF treatment. During the in vivo evaluations, SRF enhanced the therapeutic effect of CNSI-Fe as indicated by the higher tumor growth inhibition rate of 67.8 % and the higher survival rate. CNSI captured SRF in tumor to give a 6 mg/kg uptake, which lowered the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) level and enhanced the hydroxyl radical production of 4T1 tumor. In addition, CNSI-Fe treatment up-regulated the genes associated with antioxidative responses, but the up-regulation was offset by SRF. CNSI-Fe+SRF group showed similar toxicity to mice as SRF alone in the biosafety evaluations. Our results collectively indicated that the combination of CNSI-Fe and SRF could efficiently treat TNBC through ferroptosis.

AB We developed antibiotic-based micelles with bone-targeting and charge-switchable properties (P-CASMs) for treating infectious osteomyelitis. The amphiphilic molecules are formed by combining ciprofloxacin (CIP) with ligand 1 through a mild salifying reaction, and spontaneously self-assemble into antibiotic-based micelles (ASMs) in aqueous solution. Acrylate groups on ligand 1 enable cross-linking of ASMs with pentaerythritol tetra(mercaptopropionate) via a click reaction, forming pH-sensitive cross-linked micelles (CASMs). The incorporation of vinylphosphonates imparts bone-targeting and charge-switchable properties of CASMs, creating P-CASMs. These P-CASMs exhibit good biocompatibility at physiological pH and strong adhesion to bone infection sites (pH 5.5) due to electrostatic interactions. They can effectively penetrate bacterial biofilms and release antibiotics in response to the local microenvironment, thereby eradicating bacteria. Compared to previous systems, the PCASMs show higher drug loading (similar to 23 %), improved stability, and better biosafety. This innovative system holds substantial potential for clinical applications in the treatment of osteomyelitis.

AB Over the past two decades, particle-stabilized Pickering emulsions (PEs) have emerged as a versatile platform in pharmaceutical formulations, demonstrating distinct advantages over surfactant-based systems through enhanced stability, reduced toxicity, and tunable interfacial properties. These systems exhibit unique drug delivery potential through their precisely controllable architecture, particularly in achieving spatiotemporal drug release patterns, tissue-specific targeting, and enhanced therapeutic payload encapsulation. In this review, the characteristics of PEs are first detailed, followed by an introduction to the main preparation methods and the key parameters for controlling the type, droplet size, and stability of PEs. The third section categorizes and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various solid particles as emulsifiers. Lastly, emphasis is placed on the application of PEs in the pharmaceutical field, including functionalized designs and various administration routes to enlighten the rational design of PEs for effective drug delivery.

AB Carbon nanotubes-driven persulfates oxidation processes (CNTs/PS) have been extensively studied for environmental remediation. Solution pH is one of the main factors affecting wastewater treatment, but it is often overlooked. Herein, we report the effect laws of pH on the mechanism of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) or peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation by CNTs. The oxidation of organics (e.g., phenol) in the CNTs/PDS system involves an electron transfer process mediated by metastable intermediates (CNTs-PDS*), whose potential is influenced by pH, reaching the highest oxidation potential under neutral condition. In the CNTs/PMS system, the active species (i.e., SO 4 center dot- , CNTs-PMS*) shifted with pH variations. In acidic environment, phenol oxidation is governed by CNTs-PMS* . As pH increases, PMS undergoes accelerated decomposition, generating SO 4 center dot- , which plays a crucial role in pollutant oxidation. Moreover, in the CNTs/PMS system, the oxidation products of phenol were not easily accumulated on CNT surfaces, contributing to a lower total organic carbon removal in solution. Additionally, the oxidation rates of phenolic compounds in the CNTs/PMS system, which involve more complex mechanisms, exhibited a weaker correlation with their descriptors (e.g., the octanol-water partition coefficient) compared to CNTs/PDS system. This comprehensive investigation deepens our understanding of CNTs/PS systems and provides guidance for selecting superior oxidants for wastewater treatment.

AB Fingerprint recognition plays a crucial role due to its uniqueness. However, conventional detection methods suffer from significant drawbacks, including high consumption, health risk and sample contamination, which restrict their practical application in the crime investigations and forensic analysis. This necessitates the development of simple, rapid, safe and environmentally-friendly alternative methods for fingerprints detection. In this work, we report the synthesis of novel cyan-emitting carbon dots (CDs) via a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction using polyethyleneimine and coumarin as precursors. The CDs enabled the clear visualization of fingerprint patterns on various substrates through immersion and spraying methods with pure water solutions, without the need for any cosolvents. Level 2 and level 3 details of fingermarks were evidently visible for individual identification within a short exposure time under 365 nm UV light irradiation. Additionally, fluorescent 3D fingerprint images revealed direct and specific evidence regarding pressing habits. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity of CDs was tunable by adjusting the pH. We further fabricated invisible CDs ink for information encryption and decryption via UV irradiation and acid/alkali treatment. Moreover, CDs have the specific ability to sense Fe3+ ions in actual water samples, with a detection limit of 0.613 mu M and a linear range of 0-27 mu M. We conducted an in-depth study on the fluorescence quenching mechanism of CDs caused by Fe3+ ions, proposing a plausible mechanism based on a synergistic effect of dynamic quenching, static quenching and inner filter effect. Therefore, this study provides a promising multifunctional nanomaterial for fingerprint recognition, data encryption, and Fe3+ detection.

AB The significance of health literacy for elderly individuals with chronic illnesses lies in managing and delaying disease development, which is affected by personal and environmental factors. Family communication can provide an emotional support environment; self-efficacy is an important factor of subjective initiative and personality. A relatively persistent thinking and behavior pattern can affect the environment, subjective initiative, and individual health outcomes. This study aims to explore the effects of the Big Five personality traits on the health literacy of elderly individuals with chronic illnesses and to hypothesize that family communication and self-efficacy mediate the Big Five personalities and health literacy. A cross-sectional study of 2251 elderly individuals with chronic diseases was conducted through nationwide random quota sampling. The structural equation model was used to explore the mediating role of family communication and self-efficacy between the Big Five personality and health literacy. Family communication played a simple mediating role in the influence of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism on health literacy. Self-efficacy played a simple mediating role in the influence of the Big Five personalities on health literacy. Self-efficacy and family communication played a chain mediating role between extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and health literacy. Nurses can enhance the health literacy of elderly individuals with chronic illnesses with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism through family communication and self-efficacy while promoting the health literacy of those with openness through self-efficacy.

AB In previous studies, BreviBacillus borstelensis S8 exhibited favorable enzyme production characteristics. In this study, the whole genome of Br borstelenensis S8 was sequenced to analyze its genomic sequence information and functions, investigating its genotype and potential probiotic properties. The whole genome sequence of S8 was determined to be 5,559,180 bp with an average GC content of 51.5%. A total of 5406 protein-coding genes were identified and annotated using NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation. By comparing it with the complete genome sequences of Bacillus cereus strains, 1911 orthologous gene families were recognized. Genome analysis revealed the absence of active antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factor genes, and toxin-encoding genes. Safety assessments included hemolytic assays, antibiotic resistance tests, and evaluations of biogenic amine production. Functional gene analysis highlighted S8's metabolic pathways based on its genomic features. The presence of adhesion-related genes, stress response genes (e.g., acid and bile salts), antimicrobial gene clusters, and genes involved in vitamin and essential amino acid synthesis in the genome showcased the probiotic potential of S8. Simultaneously, analysis of hemolytic activity, biogenic amines production ability, acid and bile salt tolerance for the strain S8 also demonstrated its probiotic traits. The genomic exploration and probiotic activity of S8 revealed its potential as a probiotic, offering valuable genomic insights and a foundation for its safe utilization in the food industry.

AB It is well known that different muscles of yak exhibit distinctive characteristics, such as muscle fibers and metabolomic profiles. We hypothesized that different muscles could alter the flavor profile of yak jerky. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the differences in flavor profiles of yak jerky produced by longissimus thoracis (LT), triceps brachii (TB) and biceps femoris (BF) through electronic nose (E-nose), electronic tongue (E-tongue), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). The results indicated that different muscles played an important role on the flavor profile of yak jerky. And E-nose and E-tongue could effectively discriminate between yak jerky produced by LT, TB and BF from aroma and taste points of view, respectively. In particular, the LT group exhibited significantly higher response values for ANS (sweetness) and NMS (umami) compared to the BF and TB groups. A total of 65 and 47 volatile compounds were characterized in yak jerky by GC-MS and GC-IMS, respectively. A principal component analysis (PCA) model and robust principal component analysis (rPCA) model could effectively discriminate between the aroma profiles of the LT, TB and BF groups. Ten molecules could be considered potential markers for yak jerky produced by different muscles, filtered based on the criteria of relative odor activity values (ROAV) > 1, p < 0.05, and VIP > 1, namely 1-octen-3-ol, eucalyptol, isovaleraldehyde, 3-carene, D-limonene, gamma-terpinene, hexanal-D, hexanal-M, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone-M and ethyl formate. Sensory evaluation demonstrated that the yak jerky produced by LT exhibited superior quality in comparison to that produced by BF and TB, mainly pertaining to lower levels of tenderness and higher color, taste and aroma levels. This study could help to understand the specific contribution of different muscles to the aroma profile of yak jerky and provide a scientific basis for improving the quality of yak jerky.

AB Sophora flavescens, a traditional Chinese herb, produces a wide range of secondary metabolites with a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this study, we isolated six isopentenyl flavonoids (1-6) from the roots of S. flavescens and evaluated their activities against phytopathogenic fungi. In vitro activities showed that kurarinone and sophoraflavanone G displayed broad spectrum and superior activities, among which sophoraflavanone G displayed excellent activity against tested fungi, with EC50 values ranging from 4.76 to 13.94 mu g/mL. Notably, kurarinone was easily purified and showed potential activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium graminearum with EC50 values of 16.12, 16.55, and 16.99 mu g/mL, respectively. Consequently, we initially investigated the mechanism of kurarinone against B. cinerea. It was found that kurarinone disrupted cell wall components, impaired cell membrane integrity, increased cell membrane permeability, and affected cellular energy metabolism, thereby exerting its effect against B. cinerea. Therefore, kurarinone is expected to be a potential candidate for the development of plant fungicides.

AB Due to the harsh marine environment, precise node positioning has become a great challenge for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), as various errors (e.g., ranging errors) may be induced in positioning. Thus, many localization algorithms (a.k.a. positioning algorithms) have been proposed for UWSNs, but most of them exhibit limitations in accuracy due to the difficulty of complicated system modeling when considering heterogeneous errors. In this article, we propose a hybrid localization algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and mobility prediction (HLCM) when considering various kinds of errors in positioning. Different from previous location algorithms, the proposed HLCM algorithm trains a CNN-based localization model to establish the positional relationship among underwater environmental factors, anchor nodes, and ordinary nodes, which aims to alleviate the uncertainties caused by variable sound speed, with reduced various errors in the ranging process, and thus enhance localization accuracy. Besides, the proposed HLCM algorithm considers the node drifting induced by the ocean current during its positioning and predicts ordinary nodes speeds via weighted superposition of anchor nodes speeds, which helps compensate for the positional deviation generated in positioning. The simulation results and comparative analysis indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains high localization accuracy and extensive localization coverage with high fault tolerance.

AB A novel gradient-temperature heating regime was proposed to improve the texture of braised pork. Compared with one-stage pressure heat treatment of around 107 degrees C, the gradient-temperature heat regime of preheating at 60 degrees C, followed by a slow increase of temperature to 107 degrees C and simmering at 97 degrees C increased the retention of immobilized water and reduced the shear force of meat. In this cooking regime, preheating treatment at 50-60 degrees C could promote the dissociation of thin and thick myofilaments, which contributed to a weakened shrinkage of myofibrils during the subsequent high temperature heating process. Pressure-heating treatment with a slow increasing temperature and the medium-temperature simmering significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and the loss of alpha-helical, which weakened the excessive aggregation of protein and promoted the formation of myofibril network. Both the weakened shrinkage and the formation of myofibril network during gradient-temperature heating contributed to the decreased shear force and an increased immobilized water. Hence, the reduction of the oxidation and aggregation of the proteins is the key to improve the tenderness of the braised meat.

AB The effects of traditional flame stewing (TFS), commercial pressure cooking (PC), and sous-vide cooking (SVC) on the texture of pork belly and the underlying mechanism were investigated. SVC treatment at a low temperature (60 degrees C) achieved weaker oxidation of sulfhydryl groups, lower alpha-helical loss, higher surface hydrophobicity, and actomyosin dissociation, which reduced the shrinkage of myofibrils and loss of immobilized water, thus contributed to a tender meat. However, the protein aggregation predominated without actomyosin dissociation during PC treatment, causing the toughening of meat. TFS and PC intensified the atrophy of adipocytes and damage of cell membranes, which helped for the softening of adipose tissue and achieved 13.82% and 17.62 % lipid loss, respectively, and contributed to a higher ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (0.45-0.46) than SVC (0.34). Comparisons showed that TFS was a more suitable method to prepare cooked pork belly with tender and juicy texture, low lipid content, and high ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids. This study offered new insights into how cooking regimes affect the texture and lipid-lowering effects of stewed pork.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Zinc metal is regarded as one of the most promising anodes for Zn-based batteries in next-generation energy storage systems. However, the dendrite growth and interfacial corrosion lead to poor reversibility and cycle life of Zn anodes. Herein, we synthesize a 2-phosphate-1,2,4-butane tricarboxylic acid modified hyperbranched polyamidoamine containing rich terminal groups of phosphate and carboxyl (HPC) as modified layer for the Zn anodes. Importantly, the in situ acid-etching promotes the exposure of (002)Zn plane and the generated salt-polymer complexes could be adhered to the Zn anodes tightly. This greatly favors the uniform deposition of Zn and inhibits interfacial corrosion. Consequently, stable HPC@Zn anode plating/stripping for over 1200 h at a high areal capacity of 4 mAh/cm2 and a current density of 4 mA/cm2 is obtained. This study provides a new avenue of hyperbranched polymer in interfacial design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.

AB Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continuously undergo fusion/fission to maintain normal cell physiological activities and energy metabolism. When mitochondrial dynamics is unbalanced, mitochondrial homeostasis is broken, thus damaging mitochondrial function. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that impairment in mitochondrial dynamics leads to lung tissue injury and pulmonary disease progression in a variety of disease models, including inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and barrier breakdown, and that the role of mitochondrial dynamics varies among pulmonary diseases. These findings suggest that modulation of mitochondrial dynamics may be considered as a valid therapeutic strategy in pulmonary diseases. In this review, we discuss the current evidence on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in pulmonary diseases, with a particular focus on its underlying mechanisms in the development of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis (PF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung cancer and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and outline effective drugs targeting mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins, highlighting the great potential of targeting mitochondrial dynamics in the treatment of pulmonary disease.

AB This paper proposes an effective control mechanism including decentralized event -triggered conditions with a coincident control signal updating strategy, which dramatically reduces massive amount of data transmission and remarkably saves network bandwidth. Meanwhile, an asymmetric Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional (LKF) with relaxed conditions is proposed to investigate the robust performance of load frequency control (LFC) in power system. The development is capable of dealing with the frequency fluctuation of power system by utilizing LKF stability theory and stochastic analysis techniques under non -ideal communication network, such as unexpected loads, network delays and random deception attacks. Furthermore, the well -designed examples are presented to assess the effectiveness of this control strategy with quantitative analyses on: (i) implementation of control designing; (ii) comparison of communication efficiency using different trigger mechanisms; and (iii) evaluation of H infinity performance under different attack probabilities and delay upper bounds.

AB Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is commonly associated with the inappropriate use of antibiotics during meat-rabbit production, posing unpredictable risks to rabbit welfare and public health. However, there is limited research on the epidemiological dynamics of antibiotic resistance among bacteria indicators derived from local healthy meat-rabbits. To bridge the knowledge gap between antibiotic use and AMR distribution, a total of 75 Escherichia coli (E. coli) and 210 Enterococcus spp. strains were successfully recovered from fecal samples of healthy meat-rabbits. The results revealed that diverse AMR phenotypes against seven commonly used antimicrobials, including ampicillin (AMP), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (A/C), doxycycline (DOX), enrofloxacin (ENR), florfenicol (FFC), gentamicin (GEN), and polymycin B (PMB), were observed among most strains of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in two rabbit farms, although the distribution pattern of antibiotic resistance between young and adult rabbits was similar. Among them, 66 E. coli strains showed resistance against 6 antimicrobials except for PMB. However, 164 Enterococcus spp. strains only exhibited acquired resistance against DOX and GEN. Notably, the DOX-based AMR phenotypes for E. coli and Enterococcus spp. strains were predominant, indicating the existing environmental stress conferred by DOX exposure. The MICs tests suggested elevated level of antibiotic resistance for resistant bacteria. Unexpectedly, all GEN-resistant Enterococcus spp. strains resistant high-level gentamicin (HLGR). By comparison, the blaTEM, tetA, qnrS and floR were highly detected among 35 multi-resistant E. coli strains, and aac[6']-Ie-aph[2']-Ia genes widely spread among the 40 double-resistant Enterococcus spp. strains. Nevertheless, the presence of ARGs were not concordant with the resistant phenotypes for a portion of resistant bacteria. In conclusion, the distribution of AMR and ARGs are prevalent in healthy meat-rabbits, and the therapeutic antimicrobials use in farming practice may promote the antibiotic resistance transmission among indicator bacteria. Therefore, periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance in geographic locations and supervisory measures for rational antibiotic use are imperative strategies for combating the rising threats posed by antibiotic resistance, as well as maintaining rabbit welfare and public health.

AB Despite the well-established individual roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in sensing energy stress and/or hypoxia in postmortem muscle, a knowledge gap persists regarding their interplay and the consequent impact on the yak meat color stability. This study aimed to elucidate the AMPK-HIF-1 alpha interaction and its consequential impact on mitochondrial functionality, energy metabolism, and ultimately, color attributes. Postmortem yak longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscles were incubated with saline, AMPK inhibitor (Compound C), Compound C plus HIF-1 alpha activator (DMOG), and Compound C plus HIF-1 alpha inhibitor (YC-1) for 0, 6, 12, 24, 72, and 120 h, respectively. Results indicate that Compound C hindered the nuclear translocation of HIF-1 alpha (P < 0.001), in turn, DMOG upregulated AMPK protein levels (P < 0.05) by a yet unknown mechanism. Mass spectrometry analysis identified seven AMPK-induced phosphorylation sites (Ser58, Thr63, Ser65, Tyr66, Thr677, Ser14, and Ser15) mapped onto three phosphopeptides on HIF-1 alpha. Moreover, Compound C induced a significant reduction in energy metabolism levels, evidenced by decreased glycogen degradation, lactate accumulation, and pH decline (P < 0.05). Besides, Compound C promoted a consistently decreased mitochondrial protein yield, reduced NADH content, and OCR (P < 0.05). However, DMOG attenuated the effects of Compound C on mitochondrial efficiency, and interconversion of oxyto deoxymyoglobin. Collectively, these findings establish the collaborative influence of AMPK and HIF-1 alpha on postmortem energy metabolism, concurrently emphasizing their antagonistic effects on mitochondrial function.

AB The indoor thermal environment of buildings at high altitudes is poor in winter, and radiative sky cooling is not conducive to indoor thermal comfort, so it is necessary to investigate improvement measures and their impact. In the present study, a series of comparative outdoor experiments were conducted in Songpan at an altitude of 2850 m. Three identical model buildings were constructed to empirically compare the effects of different shelter measures on the indoor thermal environment of the buildings in winter under non-heated and heated conditions. The results showed that under non-heating conditions, the average temperature difference between the indoor air and the environment of the unsheltered building at night reached -1.96 degrees C and even reached up to -3.1 degrees C, and the temperature difference between the upper surface of the wall and the outside environment could reach up to -3.6 degrees C, demonstrating a significant cold room phenomenon. Under the same heating performance conditions, the average indoor-outdoor air temperature difference between the three comparison buildings at night was 18.42 degrees C (no shelter), 19.85 degrees C (top shelter) and 23.36 degrees C (full shelter), indicating that shelter measures can significantly improve the indoor thermal environment. Sheltering measures also serve to reduce heating energy consumption under heating conditions, with equivalent energy savings of up to 26.27 % for the fully sheltered building. In addition, we also found that the indoor thermal environment of high-altitude buildings has a nonuniform phenomenon, and the temperature difference of the wall in the vertical direction is the main contradiction, and the sheltering measures can significantly improve the non-uniform phenomenon of the thermal environment.

AB Background The yak (Bos grunniens) is a large ruminant species that lives in high-altitude regions and exhibits excellent adaptation to the plateau environments. To further understand the genetic characteristics and adaptive mechanisms of yak, we have developed a multi-omics database of yak including genome, transcriptome, proteome, and DNA methylation data.Description The Yak Genome Database (http://yakgenomics.com/) integrates the research results of genome, transcriptome, proteome, and DNA methylation, and provides an integrated platform for researchers to share and exchange omics data. The database contains 26,518 genes, 62 transcriptomes, 144,309 proteome spectra, and 22,478 methylation sites of yak. The genome module provides access to yak genome sequences, gene annotations and variant information. The transcriptome module offers transcriptome data from various tissues of yak and cattle strains at different developmental stages. The proteome module presents protein profiles from diverse yak organs. Additionally, the DNA methylation module shows the DNA methylation information at each base of the whole genome. Functions of data downloading and browsing, functional gene exploration, and experimental practice were available for the database.Conclusion This comprehensive database provides a valuable resource for further investigations on development, molecular mechanisms underlying high-altitude adaptation, and molecular breeding of yak.

AB Polysaccharides derived from Eucommia ulmoides leaves have immune-regulating, hypoglycemic, anti -tumor, and other beneficial functions. As a drug delivery system, polylactic-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) offers advantages like immunogenicity enhancement, improved drug absorption, and increased drug bioavailability. Currently, macrophage membranes are successfully employed in biomimetic nanomaterials to enhance drug utilization and extend drug administration time in the body, exhibiting good immunogenicity and organ targeting. In this study, we developed biomimetic PsEUL PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) coated with macrophage membrane (MM-PPsEUL) and examined their immune activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, MM-PPsEUL increased the phagocytic efficiency of macrophages without affecting their activity. In vivo, MM-PPsEUL significantly elevated the immune organ index of mice and upregulated the level of ovalbumin-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Simultaneously, it increased the expressions of cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-4, as well as the levels of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, and NF-kappa B p65 proteins in mice spleen. MM-PPsEUL also exhibited a targeting effect on inguinal lymph nodes and slowed down the release rate of antigens, thereby inducing a prolonged immune response. In summary, MM-PPsEUL provides sustained release capabilities and can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. This makes MM-PPsEUL NPs a promising antigen-targeted delivery system.

AB BackgroundFeline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) are the primary co-infecting pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract disease in cats. However, there are currently no visual detection assays available for on-site testing. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive and visual detection method based on dual recombinase polymerase amplification (dRPA) reaction and the hybrid Cas12a/Cas13a trans-cleavage activities in a one-tube reaction system, referred to as one-tube dRPA-Cas12a/Cas13a assay.ResultsThe recombinant plasmid DNAs, crRNAs, and RPA oligonucleotides targeting the FCV ORF1 gene and FHV-1 TK gene were meticulously prepared. Subsequently, dual RPA reactions were performed followed by screening of essential reaction components for hybrid CRISPR-Cas12a (targeting the FHV-1 TK gene) and CRISPR-Cas13a (targeting the FCV ORF1 gene) trans-cleavage reaction. As a result, we successfully established an ultra-sensitive and visually detectable method for simultaneous detection of FCV and FHV-1 nucleic acids using dRPA and CRISPR/Cas-powered technology in one-tube reaction system. Visual readouts were displayed using either a fluorescence detector (Fluor-based assay) or lateral flow dipsticks (LDF-based assay). As expected, this optimized assay exhibited high specificity towards only FHV-1 and FCV without cross-reactivity with other feline pathogens while achieving accurate detection for both targets with limit of detection at 2.4 x 10- 1 copies/mu L for the FHV-1 TK gene and 5.5 copies/mu L for the FCV ORF1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, field detection was conducted using the dRPA-Cas12a/Cas13a assay and the reference real-time PCR methods for 56 clinical samples collected from cats with URTD. Comparatively, the results of Fluor-based assay were in exceptional concordance with the reference real-time PCR methods, resulting in high sensitivity (100% for both FHV-1 and FCV), specificity (100% for both FHV-1 and FCV), as well as consistency (Kappa values were 1.00 for FHV-1 and FCV). However, several discordant results for FHV-1 detection were observed by LDF-based assay, which suggests its prudent use and interpretaion for clinical detection. In spite of this, incorporating dRPA-Cas12a/Cas13a assay and visual readouts will facilitate rapid and accurate detection of FHV-1 and FCV in resource-limited settings.ConclusionsThe one-tube dRPA-Cas12a/Cas13a assay enables simultaneously ultrasensitive and visual detection of FHV-1 and FCV with user-friendly modality, providing unparalleled convenience for FHV-1 and FCV co-infection surveillance and decision-making of URTD management.

AB The involvement of exogenous alanine was observed to inhibit the generation of 2-furfural during the thermal degradation of the Amadori rearrangement product (ARP). To clarify the reason for the reduced yield of 2-furfural triggered by exogenous alanine, the evolution of the precursors of 2-furfural formed in the ARP model and ARP-alanine model was investigated, and a model including ARP and N-15-labeled alanine was used to differentiate the role of endogenous and exogenous alanine in the degradation of ARP. It was found that the condensation between ARP and 3-deoxyxylosone could occur during thermal treatment. Nevertheless, the interaction of ARP with 3-deoxyxylosone exhibited an accelerated pace in the presence of exogenous alanine. In this way, exogenous alanine blocked the recovery of endogenous alanine while simultaneously enhancing the consumption of ARP and 3-deoxyxylosone during the Maillard reaction. Hence, the yield of 2-furfural was diminished with the interference of exogenous alanine. Furthermore, the promotion of the reaction between ARP and deoxyxylosone induced by exogenous alanine blocked their retro-aldolization reaction to short-chain alpha-dicarbonyls (alpha-DCs) and consequently resulted in a lack of pyrazine formation during the ARP degradation. The present study provided a feasible method for the controlled formation of 2-furfural during the thermal treatment of ARP derived from alanine.

AB Nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCD) with high fluorescence retention and good stability were successfully fabricated using citric acid and urea via a facile and eco-friendly one-step microwave method, which exhibited superior specificity for detection of nitrofurantoin (NFT). Upon the addition of NFT, the fluorescence intensity of NCD at 450 nm was significantly decreased. Besides, a satisfactory linear relationship between the fluorescence quenching efficiency and concentrations of NFT was obtained. Especially, NCD was qualitatively and quantitatively applied for detection NFT in milk and meat extract samples with a high recovery rate. Consequently, it was suggested that the detection method had potential application in the specific detection of NFT, offering a novel approach for veterinary drug residue detection.

AB Non-Saccharomyces (NSc) yeasts have great potential in improving wine qualities. In this study, two NSc and two Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) samples were tested on their performance of mono-inoculated and composite culture in the fermentation of Chunjian citrus wine. The cell count, Brix degree, total sugar, total acidity, alcohol level, pH value, color intensity (CI), and tonality were determined to evaluate the contribution of NSc to the quality of citrus wine in the mixed fermentation. Volatile compounds were analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-MS, and sensory evaluation was carried out. During the 9-day fermentation, the mixed-culture wine exhibited a higher cell concentration than the pure culture. After the fermentation, mixed-culture wine specifically decreased the concentrations of unfavorable volatile compounds, such as isobutanol and octanoic acid, and increased favorable volatile compounds, including ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, and phenylethyl acetate. The quality category of the citrus wine was improved compared with the Sc mono-inoculated wines, mainly in regard to aroma, retention, and sweetness. The study shows that the mixed fermentation of NSc and Sc has positive impacts on reducing alcohol level and total acidity and increasing CI. The present work demonstrates that the mixed fermentation of NSc and Sc has enormous beneficial impacts on improving the quality of citrus wine.

AB Mobile devices are becoming increasingly capable of delivering intelligent services by leveraging deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks (DNNs). However, due to the compute-intensive nature of these tasks, mobile devices often struggle to handle them independently, leading to the exploration of collaborative inference as a promising solution for achieving low-latency mobile intelligence. Despite its potential benefits, many challenges need to be addressed in realizing the full potential of inference acceleration. This article presents a collaborative device-edge inference optimization framework as a promising solution to inference acceleration. The framework comprises fundamental modules, including the parameters generator (PG), accuracy predictor (AP), delay calculator (DC), and optimizer (OP), which are specifically designed to identify the optimal set of parameters for model compression, DNN partition, and feature compression. To illustrate its implementation, an example of a deep CNN network is introduced, and the collaborative inference latency optimization is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem. The implementation of a specific algorithm instance using a quantum-inspired OP within the optimization framework is then presented. A multiple regression-based inference accuracy prediction model is proposed to maintain inference accuracy close to that of the original network while significantly reducing the time consumption during the offline phase. Through various simulation scenarios involving inference tasks of AlexNet and RegNet on CIFAR-10, incorporating diverse hardware computation specifications and wireless communication link conditions, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of inference acceleration compared to the compared methods.

AB Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is an acute, highly contagious swine infectious disease caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Due to the frequent mutation and recombination of PRRSV, the current commercial vaccines cannot provide effective protection, and there is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs. This study aimed to prepare a kind of zinc oxide-selenium nanoparticle (ZnO-Se NPs) and investigate their inhibitory effect on PRRSV proliferation. The hybridization of ZnO and selenium resulted in the synthesis of ZnO-Se NPs, which were then examined by using dynamic laser light scattering and transmission electron microscopy for characterization. The ZnO-Se NPs showed excellent stability and dispersibility, measuring an average diameter of 90 nm. MTT assay revealed that ZnO-Se NPs had good biocompatibility and low toxicity below 2.5 mu g/mL. Various experiments have shown that ZnO-Se NPs have the ability to effectively suppress the proliferation of PRRSV in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, this inhibition was equally effective against other subgenotypes of PRRSV and non-RNA viruses, indicating that ZnO-Se NPs had broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. Mechanism investigations revealed that ZnO-Se NPs inhibited PRRSV primarily by targeting the replication process through upregulation of the expression of NLRX1, a protein that interacts with PRRSV Nsp9, and by inhibiting PRRSV-induced upregulation of ROS, rather than by stimulating the innate immunity. This work emphasized the antiviral impact of ZnO-Se NPs and offered compelling evidence of their potential as a promising therapy against PRRSV and other viral infections.

AB The potential prebiotic feature of Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSP) has been widely accepted, while the beneficial effect of BSP on high-fat-diet-induced obesity is unclear. Moreover, the "crosstalk" between microbiota and metabolomic profile in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice supplemented with BSP still need to be further explored. The present study attempted to illustrate the effect of BSP and/or composite polysaccharides on highfat-diet-induced obese mice by combining multi-matrix (feces, urine, liver) metabolomics and gut microbiome. The results showed that BSP and/or composite polysaccharides were able to reduce the abnormal weight gain induced by high-fat diet. A total of 175 molecules were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) in feces, urine and liver, suggesting that multi-matrix metabolomics could provide a comprehensive view of metabolic regulatory mechanism of BSP in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Several pathways were altered in response to BSP supplementation, mainly pertaining to amino acid, purine, pyrimidine, ascorbate and aldarate metabolisms. In addition, BSP ameliorated high-fat-diet-induced imbalanced gut microbiome, by lowering the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes. Significant correlations were illustrated between particular microbiota's features and specific metabolites. Overall, the anti-obesity effect of BSP could be attributed to the amelioration of the disorders of gut microbiota and to the regulation of the "gut-liver axis" metabolism.

AB This paper aims to study the required solar panel tilt angle, area, and investment payback period for achieving zero-energy heating in historically significant courtyard-style residential buildings. The retrofitting approach involves positioning solar panels on the main building of the structure using four supports, each located at the corners, elevated from the ground and not in direct contact with the building. This approach does not alter the external envelope structure of the building, thereby preserving the authenticity of the cultural heritage. Using BESI software, we simulated the heating energy demand of the sample building. We integrated a solar heating system within the building and analyzed the optimal solar panel layout area, installation angle, and payback period for achieving zero-energy heating. This allowed the building to meet the zero-energy heating requirements. Taking the Hu Family Courtyard heritage conservation building as an example, we proposed the optimal layout plan for solar energy retrofitting.

AB There has been a significant shift in research focus in recent years toward laser-induced graphene (LIG), which is a high-performance material with immense potential for use in energy storage, ultrahydrophobic water applications, and electronic devices. In particular, LIG has demonstrated considerable potential in the field of high-precision human motion posture capture using flexible sensing materials. In this study, we investigated the surface morphology evolution and performance of LIG formed by varying the laser energy accumulation times. Further, to capture human motion posture, we evaluated the performance of highly accurate flexible wearable sensors based on LIG. The experimental results showed that the sensors prepared using LIG exhibited exceptional flexibility and mechanical performance when the laser energy accumulation was optimized three times. They exhibited remarkable attributes, such as high sensitivity (similar to 41.4), a low detection limit (0.05%), a rapid time response (response time of similar to 150 ms; relaxation time of similar to 100 ms), and excellent response stability even after 2000 s at a strain of 1.0% or 8.0%. These findings unequivocally show that flexible wearable sensors based on LIG have significant potential for capturing human motion posture, wrist pulse rates, and eye blinking patterns.

AB BACKGROUNDPostmortem muscle moisture loss leads to a decrease in carcass weight and can adversely impact overall meat quality. Therefore, it is critical to investigate water holding capacity (WHC) to enhance meat quality. Current research has primarily focused on examining the correlation between signaling molecules and meat quality in relation to the glycolysis effect on muscle WHC. But there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding the mechanism of WHC in Jersey cattle-yak meat.RESULTSJersey cattle-yak meat pH decreased and then increased during postmortem aging. Lactate content, cooking loss, pressing loss, drip loss and centrifuging loss of Jersey cattle-yak meat increased and then decreased during postmortem aging. The glycogen content of Jersey cattle-yak meat was significantly higher than that of yak meat at 6-120 h, being 8.40% higher than that of yak meat at 120 h. The activity of key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in Jersey cattle-yak meat was lower than that in yak meat. Correlation analysis showed that Jersey cattle-yak meat WHC was positively correlated with the activity of HK, PK, PFK and LDH.CONCLUSIONSThe WHC of Jersey cattle-yak meat was higher than that of Gannan yak meat, and it was significantly positively correlated with the activity of key enzymes of the glycolytic signaling pathway. Therefore, the glycolysis rate can be reduced by inhibiting enzyme activity to improve Jersey cattle-yak meat WHC and meat quality. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

DE carbon emissions, Chinese tourism industry, LMDI
AB This study employs a comprehensive carbon emission coefficient estimation method to assess the carbon emissions from provincial-level tourism sectors in China spanning from 2011 to 2021. Specifically, the sectors examined include tourism transportation, accommodation, catering and retail, postal and telecommunication services, as well as tourism activities. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model is applied to dissect the influencing factors of carbon emissions in the tourism industry. The results indicate an overall downward trend in carbon emissions from the tourism sector, with a spatial distribution characterized by higher emissions in the eastern regions and lower emissions in the western and northern regions. Tourism transportation and tourism activities emerge as the primary contributors to carbon emissions within the tourism sector. Additionally, the level of tourism consumption and the scale of tourists are identified as the key factors driving tourism-related carbon emissions. Furthermore, the study reveals that the tourism energy structure and tourism energy intensity play inhibitory roles in influencing carbon emissions from the tourism sector. The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the dynamics of carbon emissions in the Chinese tourism industry and offer valuable insights for formulating sustainable tourism development policies

AB Featured Application The architectural design, modeling, mechanical dynamic simulation, and corresponding analysis have been applied to a practical new construction program, a science museum located in Guangzhou, China.Abstract Heating ventilation and air conditioning systems account for over one-third of building energy usage, especially for public buildings, due to large indoor heat sources and high ventilation and thermal comfort requirements compared to residential buildings. Natural ventilation shows high application potential in public buildings because of its highly efficient ventilation effect and energy-saving potential for indoor heat dissipation. In this paper, a building design is proposed for a science museum with atrium-centered natural ventilation consideration. The floor layout, building orientation, and internal structure are optimized to make full use of natural ventilation for space cooling under local climatic conditions. The natural ventilation model is established through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for airflow evaluation under indoor and outdoor pressure differences. The preliminary results show that such an atrium-centered architectural design could facilitate an average air exchange rate over 2 h-1 via the natural ventilation effect. Moreover, indoor thermal environment simulation results indicate that the exhaust air temperature can be about 5 degrees C higher than the indoor air mean temperature during the daytime, resulting in about 41.2% air conditioning energy saving ratio due to the free cooling effect of natural ventilation. This work can provide guidance and references for natural ventilation optimization design in public buildings.

AB Within the realm of advancing photocatalysis, the investigation of material defects has perennially commanded paramount attention. However, a nuanced comprehension of the intricate interplay between these defects and the catalytic milieu necessitates deeper exploration. In the present study, oxygen vacancies (Vo) were adeptly harnessed to induce precise carrier localization, thereby effectuating a heightened augmentation of photocatalytic activity. This augmentation was deftly achieved through the deliberate modulation of external illumination parameters, resulting in the extension of carrier lifetimes. Specifically, the drastically enhanced carrier effective mass (m*) and the density of unoccupied state are directly uncovered by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation and Raman spectra. Through the utilization of wavelength dispersive in-situ fluorescence spectroscopy (WDIFS) experiments, it was observed that Vo-rich ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) displayed noteworthy photocatalytic activity around the central frequency of Vo (5.17 x 1014 Hz, 580 nm), owing to the highly efficient utilization of localized carriers. Moreover, based on Einstein rate equations, the charge carrier lifetime was found to be further prolonged with increased external illumination intensity and excitation wavelength. This work provides a methodology for optimizing the functionality of point defect on photocatalysis, where the photoinduced charge carrier localization is expected to be extensively used in further photocatalysis research.

AB Sperm survival and activity depend on the provision of energy and nutrients from seminal plasma (SP). This study aimed to investigate the variations of metabolites within SP before and after freezing and subsequently explore the potential regulatory mechanisms affecting yak sperm cryodamage due to changes in metabolites in the SP. Untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to screen for differential metabolites, followed by KEGG analysis to identify enriched signaling pathways. The combinatorial analysis of metabolomics and sperm proteomics revealed the influence of key SP metabolites on sperm proteins. Subsequently, the relevant differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western blot analysis. Finally, the mechanism underlying the positive effect of galactose on sperm motility was determined by assessing the change in ATP content in sperm before and after freezing and thawing. The data showed that a total of 425 and 269 metabolites were identified in the positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Freezing and thawing resulted in the up-regulation of 70 metabolites and the down-regulation of 29 metabolites in SP. The primary impact of freezing and thawing was observed in carbohydrate metabolism, including pyruvate metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, galactose metabolism, the TCA cycle, and butanoate metabolism. In the combined analysis and Western blot results, a significant positive correlation was observed between galactose and Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) (P < 0.05), which has the ability to convert galactose into galactol. Furthermore, the addition of galactose to thawed semen improved sperm motility by increasing AKR1B1 protein in sperm and was associated with the content of ATP. These data identify differential metabolites between fresh and frozen-thawed SP and suggest that galactose is a valuable additive for cryopreserved sperm, providing a theoretical basis for further exploration of the refrigerant formula for yak sperm cryopreservation.

AB Cooperative behavior is one of main concerns in evolutionary game researches. Since memory generally plays important roles when updating strategies, many memory-based mechanisms have been proposed to promote evolution cooperation and assumed that all players have identical memory capacity. To be more realistic, a heterogeneous memory mechanism is proposed for snowdrift game in the present paper, whose core lies in: (i) The whole population is divided into two groups and each group is endowed with different memory. (ii) When updating strategies, both adopted frequency within memory interval and the payoff performance of reference strategy are taken into account. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism results in very high cooperation levels of heterogeneous population in a wide range of the ratio r, and that the strategy updating rule can also significantly facilitate cooperation of homogeneous population. Moreover, the new mechanism reveals a "heterogeneity superiority"phenomenon, that is, the cooperation level of heterogeneous population is usually higher than the weighted sum of those of two corresponding homogeneous populations. Therefore, the proposed mechanism may have potential applications to social management.

AB The effects of different concentrations of L-lysine (L-lys, 5 mmol/L, 10 mmol/L, 15 mmol/L, and 20 mmol/L) on the structure and gelling behavior of yak meat myofibrillar protein (MP) under the oxidative stress of malondialdehyde (MDA) were explored. L-lys substantially inhibited the oxidation-induced structural deterioration of the proteins, and restored the gelation performance. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis confirmed that the addition of L-lys enhanced the structural stability of MP. L-lys also appreciably decreased oxidation-induced protein crosslinking and aggregation, as shown by particle size and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Moreover, the repair effect of L-lys on MP oxidative damage showed a significant concentration-dependent effect, in which L-lys showed the best repairment at a concentration of 20 mmol/L. These results advocate that oxidation disrupted the structure and gel characteristic of MP, but L-lys effectively restored these destructive changes.

AB The functions of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) family of proteins have been proved to be involved in various diseases, particularly the acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this work, guided by free energy perturbation (FEP) calculation, a methyl group was selected to be attached to the 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline skeleton, and a series of congeneric compounds were synthesized. Among them, compound 10 demonstrated outstanding activity against BRD4 BD1 with an IC50 value of 1.9 nM and exhibited remarkable antiproliferative effects against MV4-11 cells. The X-ray cocrystal structure proved that 10 occupied the acetylated lysine (KAc) binding cavity and the WPF shelf of BRD4 BD1. Additionally, 10 displayed high selectivity towards BET family members, effectively inhibiting the growth of AML cells, promoting apoptosis, and arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that compound 10 could suppress the expression of c-Myc and CDK6 while enhancing the expression of P21, PARP, and cleaved PARP. Moreover, 10 exhibited remarkable pharmacokinetic properties and significant antitumor efficacy in vivo. Therefore, compound 10 may represent a new, potent and selective BET bromodomain inhibitor for the development of therapeutics to treat AML.

AB This study re-examines the relationship between U.S. stock market volatility and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) using the mixed-frequency dynamic threshold model. The empirical results exhibit several findings. The EPU has a threshold effect that is time-varying. Moreover, combining the dynamic threshold with the Markov-regime Mix-frequency model (MS-MIDAS), we find that this new model can significantly improve the predictive performance in a statistical view compared to other competing models (including the benchmark model). Our findings can provide new insight into volatility forecasting.

AB Understanding of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) allocation patterns among various plant organs and tissues is crucial for gaining insights into plant growth and life-history strategies, as well as ecosystem nutrient cycles. However, there is limited information available regarding allocation strategies for N and P in bark (i.e., all tissues external to the vascular cambium), which is an indispensable and specialized secondary tissue system. This study presents analyses of a newly compiled and comprehensive data set comprising 1246 pairwise N-P observations across 335 tree species spanning 557 independent sampling sites worldwide. The aim is to explore the inter -specific N and P stoichiometry of bark. The global geometric means for bark N and P concentrations, as well as N: P ratios, were 3.88 mg/g, 0.2 mg/g, and 19.38, respectively. However, these values varied significantly among different functional plant-groups and biomes. Across all 335 species, the N vs. P scaling exponent was 0.69 for bark, which is similar to the 2/3-power scaling relationship observed in leaves and twigs. However, the bark N vs. P scaling exponent differed among functional plant-groups, biomes, and local sites, indicating the absence of a "canonical" scaling exponent. The interactions of soil total N and P collectively accounted for the most significant variation in the bark scaling exponent among local sites. The results indicate that there is no "canonical" bark N vs. P scaling exponent, and that soil nutrient content is the most important factor influencing N and P allocation strategies in bark. These findings may hold significant implications for predicting plant nutrient allocation strategies in response to environmental changes.

AB Long-range dependence is a prevalent phenomenon in various biological systems that characterizes the long-memory effect of temporal fluctuations. While recent research suggests that functional magnetic resonance imaging signal has fractal property, it remains unknown about the multifractal long-range dependence pattern of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals. The current study adopted the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis on highly sampled resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans to investigate long-range dependence profile associated with the whole-brain voxels as specific functional networks. Our findings revealed the long-range dependence's multifractal properties. Moreover, long-term persistent fluctuations are found for all stations with stronger persistency in whole-brain regions. Subsets with large fluctuations contribute more to the multifractal spectrum in the whole brain. Additionally, we found that the preprocessing with band-pass filtering provided significantly higher reliability for estimating long-range dependence. Our validation analysis confirmed that the optimal pipeline of long-range dependence analysis should include band-pass filtering and removal of daily temporal dependence. Furthermore, multifractal long-range dependence characteristics in healthy control and schizophrenia are different significantly. This work has provided an analytical pipeline for the multifractal long-range dependence in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. The findings suggest differential long-memory effects in the intrinsic functional networks, which may offer a neural marker finding for understanding brain function and pathology.

AB A synergistic effect between the helium and hydrogen elements exists in fusion reactors materials. To explore its microscopic mechanism, this paper meticulously investigates the H and He action for vacancy-like defects in pure Fe and Fe9Cr alloys by using first-principles calculations. The He and H vacancy-like defects were performed within atomistic simulations in body-centered cubic Fe and Fe9Cr alloys. Via analyzing the structures of the clusters, we find that He atoms in the VacHenHm clusters are more energetically favorable to occupy the center of the vacancy and the H atoms will attach to the free surface. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the vacancy trapping energy, vacancy formation energy, formation volumes, and the electron density maps, He elements play a more dominant role within the H/He synergistic effect, while H elements aggravate the bubble growth. There is no evident chemical bonding between He and H atoms. Concerning the Cr atoms, the Cr-He possesses the strongest repulsive energy within the considered diatomic molecules. The Cr element could weaken the aggre-gation and reduce the diffusion barriers of the vacancies, thus inhibiting the growth of vacancy-like defects to some extent. These results would help to provide insights into the synergistic effect of He and H for vacancy-like defects in Fe9Cr alloy.

AB Goat milk whey protein products are a hard-to-source commodity. Whey protein concentrate was directly prepared from fresh goat milk. The effects of the heating temperature (69-78(degrees)C), time (15-30 min), and pH (7.5-7.9) on the physicochemical and functional properties of the goat milk whey protein were investigated. The results showed that the particle size of the samples significantly increased (p < 0.05) after heat treatment. The zeta potential of polymerized goat milk whey protein (PGWP) was lower than that of native goat milk whey protein. The content of the free sulfhydryl groups of PGWP decreased with increasing heating temperature and time, while an increase in surface hydrophobicity and apparent viscosity of PGWP were observed after heat treatment. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis indicated that heat treatment and pH had considerable impacts on the secondary structure of goat milk whey protein. Transmission electron microscope images revealed that heat induced the formation of a large and uniform protein network. Additionally, the changes in the physicochemical and structural properties contributed to the improvement of the emulsifying and foaming properties of goat milk whey protein after heat treatment. The results may provide a theoretical basis for the applications of polymerized goat milk whey protein in related products.

AB In recent years, the photochemical organic transformation promoted by visible light has aroused the interest of organic chemists. Compared with traditional methods, photoredox catalysis using visible light as renewable energy has been proved to be a mild and powerful tool, which can promote the activation of organic molecules by single electron transfer (SET) process. There are a lot of amino functional groups in the structures of many natural products, and amino groups are also important structural units of some drug molecules and functional materials. Therefore, by activating the C-N bond in these substances and carrying out some coupling reactions of C-C bond formation, the structure of these compounds can be effectively modified, so as to obtain compounds with various structures and functionalization. Therefore, this study has become an important research field of organic synthesis. The research results of C-N bond breaking promoted by visible light and its application in the study of C-C bond formation reaction in recent years are reviewed, and representative examples and reaction mechanisms are discussed.

AB Recently, the low-rank matrix/tensor-based methods have attracted increasing attention for multi-dimensional multimedia data (e.g., image and video) recovery, which assumes the holistic data is low-rank. For most multimedia data, the low-rank assumption is usually violated due to their spatially diverse local similarity. The cube-based method, which breaks the holistic image into small local cubes with a fixed size, can alleviate this issue to some extent. However, cubes with a fixed size are not flexible to cover the regions of local similarity at different scales. Inspired by the superpixel, we suggest the size-adaptive super-tensor as the generic unit instead of the cube with the fixed spatial size, which allows us to flexibly exploit the local similarity at different scales. The super-tensor enjoys significant low-rankness and avoids excessive overlapped pixels as compared with cubes of fixed sizes. Empowering with the super-tensor, we propose a low-rank super-tensor approximation (LRSTA) model for multi-dimensional data recovery, which can fully exploit the local similarity and low-rankness at different scales. Moreover, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments on multimedia data, including color images, multispectral images (MSIs), and videos, verify that the proposed method outperforms the other competing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB To better utilize poorly fermented oat silage on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, 239 samples of this biomass were col-lected from the plateau temperate zone (PTZ), plateau subboreal zone (PSBZ), and nonplateau climatic zone (NPCZ) in the region and analyzed for microbial community, chemical composition and in vitro gas production. Climatic factors affect the bacterial & alpha;-diversity and & beta;-diversity of poorly fermented oat silage, which led to the NPCZ having the highest relative abundance of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Furthermore, the gas production analysis showed that the NPCZ had the highest maximum cumulative gas emissions of methane. Through structural equation modeling analysis, en-vironmental factors (solar radiation) affected methane emissions via the regulation of lactate production by L. plantarum. The enrichment of L. plantarum contributes to lactic acid production and thereby enhances methane emis-sion from poorly fermented oat silage. Notably, there are many lactic acid bacteria detrimental to methane production in the PTZ. This knowledge will be helpful in revealing the mechanisms of environmental factors and microbial rela-tionships influencing the metabolic processes of methane production, thereby providing a reference for the clean uti-lization of other poorly fermented silage.

AB Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) overexpression significantly inhibits lipid deposition during yak intramuscular preadipocyte (YIMA) differentiation; however, the regulatory mechanism remains unknown. We elucidated the role of SIRT1 in YIMA differentiation using lentivirus-mediated downregulation technology and conducted mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq assays using H3K9ac antibodies after SIRT1 overexpression in order to reveal SIRT1 targets during YIMA adipogenesis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed in order to identify the functional annotation of common genes. In addition, a potential target of SIRT1 was selected to verify its effects on the differentiation and proliferation of YIMAs. SIRT1 interfered with lipid deposition and promoted YIMA differentiation. In total, 143,518 specific peaks were identified after SIRT1 overexpression, where genes associated with downregulation peaks were enriched in transcription, gene expression, lipid-related processes, and classical lipid-related pathways. The H3K9ac signal in the whole genome promoter region (2 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site (TSS)) was weakened, and the peaks were distributed across all gene functional regions. Genes that lost signals in their TSS region or gene body region were enriched in both biological processes and pathways associated with lipogenesis. The ChIP-seq results revealed 714 common differential genes in mRNA-seq, which were enriched in "MAPK signaling", "lipid and atherosclerosis", "mTOR signaling", and "FoxO signaling" pathways. A total of 445 genes were downregulated in both their H3K9ac signals and mRNA expression, and one of their most significantly enriched pathways was FoxO signaling. Nine genes (FBP2, FPGT, HSD17B11, KCNJ15, MAP3K20, SLC5A3, TRIM23, ZCCHC10, and ZMYM1) lost the H3K9ac signal in their TSS regions and had low mRNA expression, and three genes (KCNJ15, TGM3, and TRIM54) had low expression but lost their H3K9ac signal in the gene body region. The interference of TRIM23 significantly inhibited fat deposition during preadipocyte differentiation and promoted cell proliferation by increasing S-phase cell numbers. The present study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of intramuscular fat content deposition and the epigenetic role of SIRT1 in adipocyte differentiation.

AB BackgroundHuman periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) can be applied in periodontal regeneration engineering to repair the tissue defects related to periodontitis. Theoretically, it can affect the vitality of hPDLCs that cell aging increases apoptosis and decreases autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation mechanism, which degrades the aging and damaged intracellular organelles through autophagy lysosomes to maintain normal intracellular homeostasis. Meanwhile, autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) is a key gene that regulates the level of cellular autophagy.ObjectiveThis study was to explore the effects of autophagic regulation of aging hPDLCs on cell proliferation and cell apoptosis.MethodsA cell model of aging hPDLCs overexpressing and silencing ATG7 were respectively constructed by lentiviral vectors in vitro. A series of experiments was performed to confirm relevant senescence phenotype on aging hPDLCs, and to detect the effects of changes in autophagy on their proliferation and apoptosis-related factors in aging hPDLCs.ResultsThe results showed that overexpression of ATG7 could motivate autophagy, promoting proliferation of aging hPDLCs and inhibiting apoptosis synchronously (P < 0.05). On the contrary, suppressing autophagy levels by silencing ATG7 would inhibit cell proliferation and accelerate cell senescence (P < 0.05).ConclusionATG7 regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of aging hPDLCs. Hence, autophagy may act as a target to delay senescence of hPDLCs, which can be helpful in the future in-depth study on regeneration and functionalization of periodontal supporting tissues.

AB Inspired by the service mode of family doctor contract service in China, this paper presents a multi-period problem of the combination of home health care and outpatient service over a planning horizon of multiple days. In the planning horizon, patients receive services with fixed frequencies and have different preferences for different dates. Taking the patients' service date regulations and doctors' working regulations into account, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear and convex programming model, which aims to minimize the total operating costs and maximize the patients' preference satisfaction. A hybrid tabu search algorithm with an embedded shake procedure is designed to solve the problem. Numerical experiment results imply that the hybrid tabu search algorithm performs well when compared with the exact method on small instances, and it can also provide higher quality solutions when compared with variable neighborhood search method. We also analyze problem properties and parameter sensitivities through some small instances.

AB BackgroundSuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) emerging in fungicide markets are widely used in crop protection. Currently, the structural modification focusing on a structurally diverse 'core' moiety (aryl) of SDHIs is being gradually identified as one of the innovative strategies for developing novel, highly effective and low resistant fungicides. ResultsBy optimization of lead compound SCU2028, 30 novel aromatic carboxamides Ia-o and IIa-o without a pyrazol group were designed, synthesized and characterized by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and high resolution mass spectrum (HRMS). In vitro antifungal activities showed that most of the compounds Ia-o and IIa-o exhibited good antifungal activities against Rhizoctonia solani. Among them, compounds Ic and IIc (EC50 = 0.02 mg/L), with the 2-chloro-3-pyridyl moiety, and compounds Io (EC50 = 0.03 mg/L) and IIo (EC50 = 0.02 mg/L), with the 4-methyl-2-trifluoromethylthiazolyl moiety, all exhibited the equivalent antifungal activities against R. solani with compound SCU2028 (EC50 = 0.03 mg/L) and bixafen (EC50 = 0.04 mg/L). Additionally, in pot tests, compound IIc (EC50 = 3.63 mg/L) also had higher antifungal activity against R. solani than compound SCU2028 (EC50 = 7.63 mg/L). Furthermore, in vitro inhibitory activity against fungal SDH showed the inhibitory ability of compound IIc was equivalent with that of compound SCU2028, and molecular dynamics simulation of the SDH-compound IIc complex suggested that compound IIc could strongly bind to and interact with the binding site of SDH. ConclusionNovel aromatic carboxamides without a pyrazol group have potential as a class of SDHIs, and the strategy of replacing the pyrazol group with another aryl in the 'core' moiety might offer an alternative option in discovery of SDHI fungicides.

AB Extreme climate events, such as severe droughts and heavy rainfall, have profound impacts on the sustainable provision of ecosystem functions and services. However, how N enrichment interacts with discrete extreme climate events to affect ecosystem functions is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the responses of the temporal stability (i.e., resistance, recovery, and resilience) of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in an alpine meadow to extreme dry and wet events under six N addition treatments (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 g N m-2 year-1). We found that N addition had contrasting effects on the responses of ANPP to the extreme dry versus wet events, which resulted in no overall significant effects on ANPP stability across 2015-2019. Specifically, high N addition rates reduced the stability, resistance, and resilience of ANPP in response to extreme drought, whereas medium N addition rates increased ANPP stability and recovery in response to the extreme wet event. The main mechanisms underlying the response of ANPP to extreme drought and wet events were discrepant. Species richness, asynchrony, and dominant species resistance contributed most to the reduction of ANPP resistance to extreme drought, while species asynchrony and dominant and common species resilience contributed most to the decrease of ANPP resilience from extreme drought with N enrichment. The ANPP recovery from the extreme wet event was mainly explained by dominant and common species recovery. Our results provide strong evidence that N deposition mediates ecosystem stability in response to extreme dry and wet events in different ways and modulates the provisioning of grassland ecosystem functions under increasing extreme climate events.

AB Background: GRAS transcription factors play a variety of functions in plant growth and development and are named after the first three transcription factors GAI (GIBBERRELLICACIDINSENSITIVE), RGA (REPRESSOROFGAI), and SCR (SCARECROW) found in this family. Oat (Avena sativa) is one of the most important forage grasses in the world. However, there are few reports on the GRAS gene family in oat. Methods: In order to understand the information and expression pattern of oat GRAS family members, we identified the GRAS members and analyzed their phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, and expression pattern in oat by bioinformatics technology.Results: The results showed that the oat GRAS family consists of 30 members, and most of the AsGRAS proteins were neutral or acidic proteins. The phylogenetic tree divided the oat GRAS members into four subfamilies, and each subfamily has different conservative domains and functions. Chromosome location analysis suggested that 30 GRAS genes were unevenly distributed on five chromosomes of oat. The results of real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that some AsGRAS genes (AsGRAS12, AsGRAS14, AsGRAS21, and AsGRAS24) were all up-regulated with increasing stress treatment time.The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for further research into the corresponding stress of oat. Therefore, further studies concentrating on these AsGRAS genes might reveal the many roles played by GRAS genes in oat.

AB Phase engineering has been widely utilized to promote piezoelectricity in potassium sodium niobate (KNN)-based ceramics via appropriate addition. However, the different impact on phase structure from various additives is still not researched deeply. Herein, the comparison of influence on phase transition temperatures (TR-O, TO- T and T-C) is emphasized on from different typically additives [Bi0.5Ag0.5ZrO3 (BAZ), BaZrO3 (BZ), and Sb5+], to reveal the intrinsic essence of structure evolution. The effect on rhombohedral-orthorhombic (R-O) phase boundary can be gained as BAZ > Sb5+>BZ because of the elevating and reducing TR-O with increasing BAZ and BZ when Sb5+ is decreased, respectively. And the influence on orthorhombic-tetragonal (O-T) phase boundary can be manifested as BAZ > Sb5+approximate to BZ due to the decreasing and little changed TO-T with increasing BAZ and BZ as Sb5+ is reduced, respectively. Both BAZ and BZ additives are more effective on destroying long-range ordered matrix along with lower T-C and stronger relaxor behavior with respect to Sb5+, which is induced by strong local structural heterogeneity from more complex composition. Furthermore, the effect of structure evolution on electrical properties is revealed systematically. This work is beneficial to understand the rules of phase boundary formation and promote structure adjustment via component design.

AB This article focuses on the membership-mismatched impulsive exponential stabilization for fuzzy unconstrained multilayer neural networks (MNNs) with node-dependent time-varying delays (NDTVDs). To begin with, this work proposes a novel MNNs model with unconstrained interlayer and intralayer parameters, which may allow nodes in all layers to have inconsistent attributes and structures. Meanwhile, the novel model considers the NDTVDs and removes the strict constraints including node alignment and one-to-one interlayer connection to meet diverse modeling requirements in complex applications. Then, the proposed fuzzy impulsive controller does not need to share the same fuzzy parameters as the fuzzy MNNs model, reducing the implementation complexity of the fuzzy impulsive controller. To derive the main results using the augmented vector form of unconstrained MNNs, the sparse matrix method is proposed to convert the node-dependent delayed MNNs model into an equivalent model with multiple delays. Moreover, the time-dependent Lyapunov function (TDLF) technique is adopted to improve the reliability of the stabilization conditions by fully utilizing the state information of both the current and neighboring impulsive intervals. Finally, the main results are verified using numerical simulation.

First, the fingerprint of AYF was established by UHPLC, and the similarity analysis was analyzed based on twentyone common peaks. Then the chemical constituents from AYF were analyzed and identified by UHPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS/MS). Next, the antioxidant activity of twelve batches of AYF was assessed in vitro. Subsequently, eleven chemical markers were screened out by fingerprints and antioxidant activity utilizing grey relational analysis (GRA) and partial least squares (PLS). Finally, the contents of eleven chemical markers in twelve batches of AYF were detected by UHPLC, and the antioxidant quality of AYF was evaluated using chemometric analysis, such as principal components analysis (PCA) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The results showed that the antioxidant efficacy was associated with the total content of eleven compounds of AYF. Moreover, this method to discover quality markers was reasonable by fingerprint-activity relationship combination with chemometric analysis. The present study will certify quality markers associated with therapeutic effects, and provide a powerful strategy for evaluating the resource quality of AYF.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB This article studies lag group consensus problems of multiagent systems with directed information transformations. Agents in the network are divided into finite groups, and modeled by high-order systems. Distributed consensus protocols with constant lags are presented to realize the lag group consensus: the states of the agents in a group approach to a consensus value asymptotically, while there exist given ratios between the final values of different groups. Necessary and sufficient criteria for the lag group consensus are obtained by the Laplace transformation. Finally, theoretical results are proved to be effective by several simulation results.

AB Tourism development provides a unique context for studying guanxi in acquaintance society in rural areas in China. Taking the case of Moon village from the perspective of guanxi, this study conducted a qualitative study to analyze the structural characteristics of the semi-acquaintance society in the tourism context. A buffer guanxi circle develops when strangers immerse themselves into an acquaintance-based society through social interaction, where affection and reasoning define the boundary, guanxi and the interests on which the social consensus is based, as well as the elite and collective actions vitalizing the community. These findings on how the semi-acquaintance society contributes to guanxi imply a co-governance structure for informal relations in governance in community-based rural tourism.

AB Automatic modulation recognition is a major project in the field of radio cognition; however, the generalization ability of conventional models cannot satisfy practical applications. In order to improve the generalization performance of the deep learning model and increase its recognition efficiency, we propose a novel model: ElsNet (elastic convolutional neural network). This network designs a channel optimization module, by inputting the average pooling information of the feature map and the intrinsic parameters of the batch normalization layer, to dynamically optimize the connection relations between network neurons and enhance the generalization ability of the model. ElsNet achieves an accuracy of about 94% at signal-to-noise ratios of 0-20 dB. Subsequent experiments have also demonstrated that, the ElsNet has a satisfying performance in transferred data sets and a peak accuracy of 82% through transfer learning, which to a certain extent alleviates the problem that the current signal modulation recognition can only be applied to signals with the same modulation parameters as the training dataset and has poor performance in recognizing real signals with different modulation parameters.

AB BackgroundPaeonia veitchii Lynch, a well-known herb from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau south of the Himalayas, can synthesize specific monoterpene glycosides (PMGs) with multiple pharmacological activities, and its rhizome has become an indispensable ingredient in many clinical drugs. However, little is known about the molecular background of P. veitchii, especially the genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PMGs.ResultsA corrective full-length transcriptome with 30,827 unigenes was generated by combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) of six tissues (leaf, stem, petal, ovary, phloem and xylem). The enzymes terpene synthase (TPS), cytochrome P450 (CYP), UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT), and BAHD acyltransferase, which participate in the biosynthesis of PMGs, were systematically characterized, and their functions related to PMG biosynthesis were analysed. With further insight into TPSs, CYPs, UGTs and BAHDs involved in PMG biosynthesis, the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) method was used to identify the relationships between these genes and PMGs. Finally, 8 TPSs, 22 CYPs, 7 UGTs, and 2 BAHD genes were obtained, and these putative genes were very likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of PMGs. In addition, the expression patterns of the putative genes and the accumulation of PMGs in tissues suggested that all tissues are capable of biosynthesizing PMGs and that aerial plant parts could also be used to extract PMGs.ConclusionWe generated a large-scale transcriptome database across the major tissues in P. veitchii, providing valuable support for further research investigating P. veitchii and understanding the genetic information of plants from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. TPSs, CYPs, UGTs and BAHDs further contribute to a better understanding of the biology and complexity of PMGs in P. veitchii. Our study will help reveal the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis pathway of these specific monoterpene glycosides and aid in the comprehensive utilization of this multifunctional plant.

Upon the addition of H2S, the probe DC-HS solution's fluorescence significantly increased, and its appearance is changed from practically colorless to brilliant yellow. Probe DC-HS also showed significant fluorescence amplification that was quantitatively detectable in the concentration range of 0-1.5 mu M and had a low detection limit or limit of detection of 0.2 nM. Moreover, with a high recovery rate and excellent accuracy, the developed fluorescent molecule was used successfully for the analysis of H2S in red wine samples.

AB Simple Summary Bovine rhinitis virus (BRV) is an important pathogen causing bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and it can be divided into two genotypes-bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV). However, knowledge about the prevalence and molecular information of BRV in China is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRV in beef cattle with BRDC syndrome in China, and the results confirmed the circulation of BRAV and BRBV. The genomic sequences of BRAVs in this study showed an independent evolutionary trend while BRBVs exhibited significant genetic heterogeneity, and the recombination patterns of both types of BRVs were distinct from what was observed in a previous study. The present study reported the presence and prevalence of BRAV in China, providing recommendations for prevention and control of BRDC, and contributed to a better understanding of the evolution of BRV. Bovine rhinitis virus (BRV) is an etiological agent of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) and can be divided into two genotypes-bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV). However, knowledge about the prevalence and molecular information of BRV in China is still limited. In this study, 163 deep nasal swabs collected from bovines with BRDC syndrome on 16 farms across nine provinces of China were tested for BRAV and BRBV by a duplex real-time RT-PCR assay. The results showed that 28.22% (46/163) of the samples were BRV-positive, and the positive rates were 22.09% (36/163) for BRAV and 9.2% (15/163) for BRBV. The co-circulation of both BRV genotypes was observed on two farms. Furthermore, five near-complete BRV genomes, including three BRAVs and two BRBVs, were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the three obtained BRAVs were phylogenetically independent, while the two BRBVs exhibited significant genetic heterogeneity. Recombination analysis revealed that three BRAVs and one BRBV strain obtained in this study were recombinants. The present study confirmed the presence and prevalence of BRAV in China, and it found that both types of BRV are circulating in beef cattle, which contributes to a better understanding of the prevalence and molecular characteristics of BRV.

AB The role of gut microbiota has been described as an important influencer of the immune system. Gut-lung axis is critical in the prevention of mycobacterium infection, but the specific mechanism, by which dysbiosis affects tuberculosis, has not been reported. In this study, we attempted to provide more information on how the gut-lung axis contributes to Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection. Mice are pre-treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics cocktail (Abx) to induce gut dysbiosis. Interestingly, dysbiosis of microbes showed a significant increase in the bacterial burden in the lungs and inhibited the level of COX-2. After faecal transplantation, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression was restored and the inflammatory lesion in the lungs was reduced. Further research found that the deficiency of COX-2 inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). This mechanism was completed by COX-2 interaction with BIP. Moreover, we found a positive feedback mechanism by which blocking ER stress could reduce COX-2 levels by the NF-kappa B pathway. Taken together, we reveal for the first time gut dysbacteriosis exacerbates M. bovis disease by limiting the COX-2/ER stress pathway. The finding strengthens the foundation of gut microbiota-targeted therapy for tuberculosis treatment.
